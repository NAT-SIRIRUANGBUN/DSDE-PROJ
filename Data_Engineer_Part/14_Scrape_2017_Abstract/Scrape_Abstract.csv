2-s2.0-85029781991,"An experimental program was carried out to investigate the shear capacity of High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) I-beams. The main parameters were assigned as the fiber content and presence of shear reinforcement. To study the effect of these main parameters on the shear capacity, testing of six I-beams and other control specimens was conducted. It can be observed from the results of the experimental study that the presence of fibers and shear reinforcement significantly improves the ultimate capacity and structural behavior of HPFRC members. Finally, the experimental results are discussed, and the shear capacity of HPFRC can be estimated by extending the code provisions stated in AFGC-Sétra 2013. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

EMT is therefore becoming a potential target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Here, we showed that phoyunnanin E, a compound isolated from Dendrobium venustum, possesses anti-migration activity and addressed its mechanism of action. Methods: The cytotoxic and proliferative effects of phoyunnanin E on human non-small cell lung cancer-derived H460, H292, and A549 cells and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells were investigated by MTT assay. The effect of phoyunnanin E on EMT was evaluated by determining the colony formation and EMT markers. The migration and invasion of H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells was evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay, respectively. EMT markers, integrins and migration-associated proteins were examined by western blot analysis. Results: Phoyunnanin E at the concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, which are non-toxic to H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells showed good potential to inhibit the migratory activity of three types of human lung cancer cells. The anti-migration effect of phoyunnanin E was shown to relate to the suppressed EMT phenotypes, including growth in anchorage-independent condition, cell motility, and EMT-specific protein markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, slug, and snail). In addition to EMT suppression, we found that phoyunnanin E treatment with 5 and 10 μM could decrease the cellular level of integrin αv and integrin β3, these integrins are frequently up-regulated in highly metastatic tumor cells. We further characterized the regulatory proteins in cell migration and found that the cells treated with phoyunnanin E exhibited a significantly lower level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), and their downstream effectors (including Ras-related C3 botulinum (Rac-GTP); Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42); and Ras homolog gene family, member A (Rho-GTP)) in comparison to those of the non-treated control. Conclusions: We have determined for the first time that phoyunnanin E could inhibit the motility of lung cancer cells via the suppression of EMT and metastasis-related integrins. This new information could support further development of this compound for anti-metastasis approaches. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85039924338,"Effect of hydrogen and alkoxysilanes as external donor were investigated using two commercial Ziegler-Natta catalysts (TiCl4/MgCl2•nEtOH and TiCl4/phthalate type/MgCl2) in ethylene polymerization. These catalysts were analyzed by EDX, FTIR and XRD measurements. Furthermore, catalytic activity was tested. According to the results, when alkoxysilane was introduced into the system, catalytic activity reduced. Compared these two alkoxysilanes, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (CHMDMS) can decrease activity more than dimethoxydimethylsilane (DMDMS) did. This was because CHMDMS has more bulky hydrocarbon groups than DMDMS. This led to restrict the direction of monomer insertion to active sites. In addition, when hydrogen was added into the system, CHMDMS is more sensitive to hydrogen than DMDMS. However, CHMDMS showed lower hydrogen response than DMDMS with increased hydrogen concentration. This was owing to its hydrogen sensitivity. Among the two catalysts, catalyst having internal donor can decrease sensitivity of catalyst activity in the system with hydrogen. The obtained polymers were further characterized by DSC and GPC. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039922521,"This paper focuses on the applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) to develop a model for water resource management in the Pranburi watershed by using stakeholder participation. The hierarchy model structure of the Pranburi watershed was developed by the experts based on IWRM and classified into 4 criteria, 15 sub-criteria, and 3 alternatives. The questionnaire method was the tool used for obtaining a weighing for comparison between the pairs of criteria obtained from community representatives. The finding revealed that the important criteria are the environmental factors. The highest ranked of the alternatives is the watershed planning strategy. These results implied that community focused stakeholder participation in the decision-making process for water resources in Pranburi watershed gave a positive outcome. This research clearly presented the capability of the AHP approach integrates with IWRM principle for water resource planning. The AHP approach can analyze the community representative’s relevant data before decision making, by applying pairwise comparison of the AHP technique, can reduce bias during decision making. More importantly, the government should support collaboration with local officers and the community in the decision making policy on water resource planning. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039920890,"We developed a robot, CUREs (Chulalongkorn University Rehabilitation Robotic Exoskeleton system), for upper extremity rehabilitation. The active assistive control strategy based on the impedance force control is developed and implemented to obtain assistive-resistive paths tracking for rehabilitation activities. The desired trajectory or rehabilitated training pattern for each specific patient need to be assigned first by a medical doctor and a physical therapy. The therapist can program the desired trajectory by guiding the patient arm based on the assigned path pattern and the set of via points will be stored and used for generating the desired trajectory. The desired trajectory will be stored specific for the patient and can be called back anytime. During the rehabilitation, the robot can assist and resist the patient’s arm to follow the desired trajectory. If the patient has difficulty moving his arm to track the desired path, the robot will help by adding more torque to help the patient to move his arm to reduce the error between the desired path and the actual posture. And if the patient himself can move his arm tracking the desired path, the robot will not apply any more force to assist or resist. The necessary state variables such as angular position and torque can be recorded during the training. The main purpose of the experiment, follow the medical ethic, is to assure that there is no side effect for using this rehabilitation robot. Five subacute stroke patients participated in this pilot study. All patients have severe upper extremity weakness. The medical doctor will assign the training pattern based on patient condition. The result showed that the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity Scale was improved after 10 days of training in all participants without any sign of side effect. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039920812,"Gear tooth strength is mainly considered in gear design to ensure the ability to transmit power. With the design process, various sets of gear parameters are probably selected to meet the tooth strength. However the efficiencies of various designed gears are different. Improper gear parameter selection probably makes the gear power loss increase significantly. In this paper, the design methodology to minimize gear power loss is presented. A spur gear selected from a catalogue is used as the reference gear. Then several gears with various parameters but having the ability to transmit the same load are designed. The power losses of the designed and the reference gears are estimated by the sliding loss model, hence the minimum power loss gear is able to choose from the various designed gear set.s Both analytical and experimental results show that to minimize gear power loss along with keeping loading capacity, pressure angle should be increased and module should be reduced. The effect of this design methodology on vibration characteristics is also investigated by measuring the vibration attributed to the sample gear sets. It is found that the helical gear having large pressure angle, wide face width and having helix angle about 10° to 20° is favorable, since it has more capability to transmit load, lower power loss and also lower vibration than the reference spur gear. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039922690,"Pairwise testing is a widely used technique for software testing with the reduced size of the test suite and able to detect interactions that trigger the system’s faults. In addition, pairwise testing test suites must be able to take constraints between input parameters and parameter values into account. In current practice, identifying and selecting input parameters and parameter values usually depends on tester skills that might not be sufficient. Input parameters and parameter values modeling and tools for easily guiding and prioritizing the selection of optimal input parameters and parameter values for the SUT is also required. In this work, we present an approach for prioritizing input parameters and parameter values modeling using statistical user profile. Our approach is implemented in a tool called UPPTCT which provides the ability to handle constraints on input parameters and parameter values for pairwise testing in order to generate test cases. We conduct experiments to evaluate test case effectiveness and compare our tool with other renowned pairwise test generation and constraints handling tools. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of our approach is significantly more efficient and effective than random testing as a large portion of reported defects with regard to statically user profile were caught by our approach. Furthermore, our tool performs better in some cases and performs comparable results for generating test cases upon input parameters and parameter values for both with constraints handling and without constraints handling. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039917530,"After a severe fire, concrete structures are generally capable of being repaired rather than demolished. To determine whether the fire-damaged structure can be repaired, an assessment of structural integrity must be conducted. In this research, a laboratory assessment of fire-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) slabs was carried out by using Destructive Testing (DT) and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques. The study aimed to evaluate the depth of damaged concrete in RC slabs exposed to fire for different periods of time (30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes) based on the correlation between the experimental results of DT and NDT methods. The experiment was conducted with two concrete grades of 24 and 35 MPa. Limestone aggregates were used in this study. The experimental results indicated that 30 minutes of heating time did not show severe effects on reinforced concrete slabs in comparison with the other cases. A damaged concrete layer of 30 - 45 mm was observed for slabs exposed to fire in 60 and 90 minutes. Besides, 24 MPa slabs also showed a lower damage level compared with 35 MPa slabs. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039914805,"In the present work, the effects of Ti addition on the characteristics and catalytic properties of the different silica-based supported nickel (Ni) catalysts were investigated. The different supports, such as the spherical silica particle (SSP), MCM41, TiSSP, and TiMCM were synthesized and used to prepare the Ni catalysts having 20 wt% of Ni loading for CO2 hydrogenation under methanation. The different supports and catalysts were characterized by means of N2 physorption, XRD, SEM/EDX, XPS, TPR, and CO chemisorption. The TiO2 was present in the anatase form after catalyst calcination. The addition of Ti can play important roles on the characteristics and catalytic properties of Ni catalysts by: (i) facilitating the reduction of Ni oxides species strongly interacted with support, (ii) preventing the formation of silicate compounds, and (iii) promoting the CO and CO2 dissociation resulting in complete inhibition of the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, especially at high temperature. Based on CO2 hydrogenation, the NiTiMCM exhibited the highest activity and stability. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039914338,"A main difficult task in batch crystallization is to control the size distribution of crystal products. Complexity and highly nonlinear dynamic behavior directly affect to model-based control strategies which heavily depend on the rigorous knowledge of crystallization. In this work, neural network-based model predictive control and inverse neural network control strategies are proposed and integrated with an optimization based on neural network-based hybrid model to control temperatures of a purified terephthalic acid batch crystallizer. A neural network-based hybrid model of the batch crystallizer is developed to provide nonlinear dynamic responses used in optimization algorithm for finding an optimal temperature profile related to the quality of a crystal product. Then, the obtained optimal profile is used as set points of the proposed control strategies for improving the crystal product quality. The performances and robustness of the proposed controllers are evaluated in several cases such as for set point tracking and plant/model mismatches. Simulation results show that the neural network-based model predictive control gives the best control performance among the inverse neural network control and a conventional PID controller in all cases. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039915342,"The case-study company faces the limited space situation. Thus, the company decides to uninstall their temporary warehouses and re-locate products in two permanent warehouses. The objective of this research is to design the layouts of the two permanent warehouses so that the spaces can be efficiently used and the total picking distance is low. The past data, Invoices and Stock Data, are used for developing layouts designing processes. This research involves the collecting of Product Size Data to calculate the required space for the products. There are two phases in layout designing process. The first phase is the product categories grouping. This phase categorizes product categories into two groups for the two warehouses. The second phase is the layouts designing. In this phase, the layouts of the two warehouses and the locations of the products are designed. According to the company requirements and policies, the Adapted Class-Based Turnover Assignment is adopted in order to design the layouts for the two warehouses. Layouts of the warehouses are designed, analyzed, and evaluated. The best layouts give the best trade-off between quantitative results, i.e., the total picking distance and the remaining space, and qualitative results, i.e., the usability and the product suitability. The designed layouts are applied in the case-study company. This research develops a systematic and practical layout designing method which is flexible and can be adopted in other warehouses. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039898441,"This paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical technique, based on a scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) that is capable of solving two-dimensional, second-order, linear, multi-field boundary value problems. Basic governing equations are established in a general, unified context allowing the treatment of various classes of linear problems such as steady-state heat conduction problems, steady-state flow in porous media, linear elasticity, linear piezoelectricity, and linear piezomagnetic and piezoelectromagnetic problems. A scaled boundary finite element approximation is also formulated within a general framework integrating the influence of the distributed body source, general boundary conditions, contributions of the general side-face data, and the flexibility of scaled boundary approximations. Standard procedures for numerical integration, search of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, determination of particular solutions, and solving a system of linear algebraic equations are adopted. After fully tested with available benchmark solutions, the proposed SBFEM is applied to solve various classes of linear problems under different scenarios to demonstrate its vast capability, computational efficiency and robustness. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039910610,"A number system that is well-designed can affect the computational time and the hardware implementation. An interesting number system called Round-to-Nearest coding (RN-coding) was proposed to reduce a time consuming in a rounding process. Rounding to the nearest in RN-coding can be done using only truncation at any positions in a sequence of digits (representation). This concept can save a lot of time in a parallel or pipeline computation manner. However, an RN-coding does not support an on-line arithmetic computation. In this paper, we propose a rational digit number system which is composed of rational signed-digits in the digit set. This new system preserves a round-to-nearest property and is suitable for an on-line arithmetic computation. Performing on-line elementary arithmetic operations in our system can be done by an on-line digit set conversion algorithm. We show that our new algorithm, which is an improvement of an on-line addition algorithm in our previous work, can be demonstrated by an on-line finite automaton with a finite on-line delay κ. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85039907641,"This paper proposes an alternative method for pulse oximetry processing based on time-frequency analysis. Instead of using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) together with the median calculation was proposed for finding the frequency components of the normalized first derivative red and infrared photoplethysmographic signals (PPG). In order to estimate the arterial oxygen saturation (%SpO2), the ratio of each red CWT modulus to each corresponding infrared CWT modulus was computed at each frequency, and then converted to the oxygen saturation by using the saturation equation obtained from calibration. All of the oxygen saturation data were plotted on a histogram. The greatest oxygen saturation with the most occurrences was considered to represent the %SpO2. The experiments were held to evaluate the performance of the proposed processing method compared with the conventional pulse oximetry (CPO) processing. The red and infrared PPGs were acquired from left and right index fingers simultaneously by using the PPG measurement system constructed in the laboratory. During measurement, the left index finger was stationary, while the right index finger was performed the finger bend to induce the motion artifact (MA) in transient and periodic manners. All detected PPGs were processed by the proposed method and the CPO processing. The %SpO2 obtained from different processing methods and positions were compared. Experimental results showed that the proposed method was more resistant to the MA than the conventional method. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039897067,"Large transportation projects such as highways are expensive, complex, and dynamic in nature. Acquiring large investment capitals for these projects is always a major challenge for every nation. To solve this problem, Vietnamese government has called for the participation of private entities in the form of public-private partnership (PPP). Attracting private investors is a vital and challenging step for implementing PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. This paper examines the similarities and differences of risk perceptions of the public and private sectors for the investment of PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Questionnaire surveys are used to collect data for assessing the likelihoods of occurrence and impacts of risk factors from 123 experienced professionals from both public and private entities. We found that the two most critical risk factors (CRFs) are land acquisition and compensation, and delay in project approvals and permits. The results from an independent sample t-test indicate the different risk perceptions of the public and private sectors for eight CRFs: (1) corruption, (2) change of project scope, (3) lack of transparency in bidding, (4) inflation, (5) payment issues, (6) inadequate feasibility study, (7) inappropriate allocation of responsibility and risk, and (8) fluctuation of interest rate. These eight CRFs are categorized into three major groups: the tendering process, commercial problems, and payment issues. These results can be used for establishing appropriate public policies to promote private investments in PPP transportation projects. Meanwhile, private investors would also have a better understanding of PPP transportation project development in Vietnam. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85039709530,"We present high spatial resolution (FWHM ∼0.″14) observations of the CO(8-7) line in GDS-14876, a compact star-forming galaxy at z =2.3 with a total stellar mass of log(M ∗/M o) =10.9. The spatially resolved velocity map of the inner r ≲ 1 kpc reveals a continuous velocity gradient consistent with the kinematics of a rotating disk with v rot(r = 1 kpc) =163 ±5 km s-1 and v rot/σ ∼2.5. The gas-to-stellar ratios estimated from CO(8-7) and the dust continuum emission span a broad range, and , but are nonetheless consistent given the uncertainties in the conversion factors. The dynamical modeling yields a dynamical mass of , which is lower, but still consistent with the baryonic mass, , if the smallest CO-based gas fraction is assumed. Despite a low, overall gas fraction, the small physical extent of the dense, star-forming gas probed by CO(8-7), ∼3× smaller than the stellar size, implies a strong relative concentration that increases the gas fraction up to in the central 1 kpc. Such a gas-rich center, coupled with a high star formation rate (SFR) ∼500 M o yr-1, suggests that GDS-14876 is quickly assembling a dense stellar component (bulge) in a strong nuclear starburst. Assuming its gas reservoir is depleted without replenishment, GDS-14876 will quickly (t depl ∼ 27 Myr) become a compact quiescent galaxy that could retain some fraction of the observed rotational support. © 2017.

2-s2.0-85032489556,"Aims Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic effect, and may block the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. Adequate vitamin D levels in conjunction with the use of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers may help to slow down chronic kidney disease progression. Main methods To study a possible beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in chronic kidney disease patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on chronic kidney disease progression we performed a clinical study involving vitamin D supplementation in patients with deficiency of this vitamin. This study was conducted in two chronic kidney disease clinics in the city of Londrina, Brazil, from October 2010 to December 2012. It was involved stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 60 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) patients with and without vitamin D deficiency. The patients ingested six-month cholecalciferol 50,000 IU oral supplementation to chronic kidney disease patients with vitamin D deficiency. We hypothesize changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate over study period. Significance Our data demonstrate reservation of estimated glomerular filtration with cholecalciferol supplementation to chronic kidney disease patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. The combination treatment of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers with cholecalciferol prevents the decline in estimated glomerular filtration in patients with chronic kidney disease following treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and may represent a valid approach to reduce renal disease progression in chronic kidney disease patients with vitamin D deficiency.

2-s2.0-85032271239,"A combination of fluorophore and nucleobase through a π-conjugated rigid linker integrates the base pairing and the fluorescence change into a single event. Such base discriminating fluorophore can change its fluorescence as a direct response to the base pairing event and therefore have advantages over tethered labels or base surrogates lacking the hydrogen-bonding ability. 8-(Pyrene-1-yl)ethynyl-adenine (APyE) has been extensively used as fluorescence labels in DNA and LNA, but it showed little discrimination between different nucleobases. Herein we investigated the synthesis, base pairing ability and optical properties of APyE in pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid – a DNA mimic that shows much stronger affinity and specificity towards DNA than natural oligonucleotides. The APyE in PNA pairs specifically with thymine in the DNA strand, and resulted in 1.5–5.2-fold enhanced and blue-shifted fluorescence emission. Fluorescence quenching was observed in the presence of mismatched base or abasic site directly opposite to the APyE. The behavior of APyE in acpcPNA is distinctively different from DNA whereby a fluorescence was increased selectively upon duplex formation with complementary DNA and therefore emphasizing the unique advantages of using PNA as alternative oligonucleotide probes. Applications as color-shifting probe for detection of trinucleotide repeats in DNA were demonstrated, and the performance of the probe was further improved by combination with reduced graphene oxide as an external nanoquencher. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85029811763,"In this work, the spherical shape of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) tiny particles with high purity was successfully produced. Carboxymethyl cellulose from bleached bagasse pulp (CMCB) was synthesized at various alkaline concentrations from 20%(w/v) to 60%(w/v) and then the spray drying process was utilized as a simultaneous shape forming and purification step to obtain CMC microspheres without remnants of cellulose fibers. The alkalization of the bleached bagasse cellulose for carboxymethylation had no significant effect on the degree of substitution (DS), which was approximately 0.80. Increasing alkaline concentration influenced the properties of the CMC microsphere; e.g. increasing%NaCl and resulted to degrade cellulose fiber as observed by the gradual decreasing of%yield, %CMC, density, crystallinity and particle size. The morphology of CMCB microspheres revealed more crack marks on the surface and their granule sizes were smaller (0.10–0.15 μm) when adding 40–60% (w/v) NaOH concentrations. The CMCB spray dried microspheres were cast to CMC films and their physical, mechanical and barrier properties were further investigated to determine the proper alkaline concentration for mercerization step. The CMCB film of microphere using 40%(w/v) NaOH showed the highest tensile strength (53.7 MPa) as well elongation at a break of 3.09%. Increasing alkaline concentration coupled with the use of the spray drying process resulted in decreasing film viscosity but increasing CMCB film's water solubility, tensile strength and elongation (up to 40%, w/v of NaOH concentration), water vapor and oxygen gas transmission rates (WVTR and OTR). The WVTR and OTR of CMCB film were reported to be in the range of 14.25–16.76 g/m2 day and 1.94–5.50 × 10−4 cm3/m2 day Pa, respectively.

2-s2.0-85033555515,"The binding capability of pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to DNA have been studied experimentally, also the high affinity and sequence specificity were reported. However, to date a detailed understanding of these properties is unclear due to a lack of crystallographic data. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pyrrolidinyl PNA with different stereochemistry, (2′R,4′R)- and (2′R,4′S)-prolyl-(1S,2S)-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (namely acpcPNA and epi-acpcPNA, respectively), binding to DNA were performed. MD simulations of three different forms (A-, B- and P-forms) were conducted to investigate the probable duplex conformation, which revealed that the MD structures were close to B-type duplex. It was found that acpcPNA and epi-acpcPNA backbones play a minor role in the hydrogen bond geometry of base pair, however, these greatly influence the interactions between PNA and DNA strands, leading to the differences in duplex stability. The calculated binding free energy revealed the higher thermodynamic stability of acpcPNA-DNA compared to epi-acpcPNA-DNA system, which is in good agreement with published experimental data. This work offers new insights into the conformational and energetic properties of pyrrolidinyl PNA-DNA duplexes at a molecular level. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85021181600,"The enormous demand for medical diagnostics has encouraged the fabrication of high- performance sensing platforms for the detection of glucose. Nonenzymatic glucose sensors are coming ever closer to being used in practical applications. Bimetallic catalysts have been shown to be superior to single metal catalysts in that they have greater activity and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate the preparation, characterization, and electrocatalytic characteristics of a new bimetallic Pt/Au nanocatalyst. This nanocatalyst can easily be synthesized by electrodeposition by sequentially depositing Au and Pt on the surface of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode. We characterized the nanocatalyst by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and voltammetry. The morphology and composition of the nanocatalyst can be easily controlled by adjusting the electrodeposition process and the molar ratio between the Pt and Au precursors. The electrocatalytic characteristics of a Pt/Au/BDD electrode for the nonenzymatic oxidation of glucose were systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The electrode exhibits higher catalytic activity for glucose oxidation than Pt/BDD and Au/BDD electrodes. The best catalytic activity and stability was obtained with a Pt:Au molar ratio of 50:50. Moreover, the presence of Au can significantly enhance the long-term stability and poisoning tolerance during the electro-oxidation of glucose. Measurements of glucose using the Pt/Au/BDD electrode were linear in the range from 0.01 to 7.5 mM, with a detection limit of 0.0077 mM glucose. The proposed electrode performs selective electrochemical analysis of glucose in the presence of common interfering species (e.g., acetaminophen, uric and ascorbic acids), avoiding the generation of overlapping signals from such species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85041048740,"Background: Previous studies in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) have suggested that calpain-3 (CAPN3) mutations result in aberrant regeneration in muscle. Methods: To gain insight into pathogenesis of aberrant muscle regeneration in LGMD2A, we used a paradigm of cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced cycles of muscle necrosis and regeneration in the CAPN3-KO mice to simulate the early features of the dystrophic process in LGMD2A. The temporal evolution of the regeneration process was followed by assessing the oxidative state, size, and the number of metabolic fiber types at 4 and 12 weeks after last CTX injection. Muscles isolated at these time points were further investigated for the key regulators of the pathways involved in various cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cellular energy status, metabolism, and cell stress to include Akt/mTORC1 signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and AMPK signaling. TGF-β and microRNA (miR-1, miR-206, miR-133a) regulation were also assessed. Additional studies included in vitro assays for quantifying fusion index of myoblasts from CAPN3-KO mice and development of an in vivo gene therapy paradigm for restoration of impaired regeneration using the adeno-associated virus vector carrying CAPN3 gene in the muscle. Results: At 4 and 12 weeks after last CTX injection, we found impaired regeneration in CAPN3-KO muscle characterized by excessive numbers of small lobulated fibers belonging to oxidative metabolic type (slow twitch) and increased connective tissue. TGF-β transcription levels in the regenerating CAPN3-KO muscles were significantly increased along with microRNA dysregulation compared to wild type (WT), and the attenuated radial growth of muscle fibers was accompanied by perturbed Akt/mTORC1 signaling, uncoupled from protein synthesis, through activation of AMPK pathway, thought to be triggered by energy shortage in the CAPN3-KO muscle. This was associated with failure to increase mitochondria content, PGC-1α, and ATP5D transcripts in the regenerating CAPN3-KO muscles compared to WT. In vitro studies showed defective myotube fusion in CAPN3-KO myoblast cultures. Replacement of CAPN3 by gene therapy in vivo increased the fiber size and decreased the number of small oxidative fibers. Conclusion: Our findings provide insights into understanding of the impaired radial growth phase of regeneration in calpainopathy. © 2017 The Author(s)."

CaO blended with Fe3O4 can improve the binding efficiency and specific activity. The oxidised birchwood xylan was a linking molecule for enzyme and metal nanoparticles. The analysis of the immobilized enzyme by FTIR, SEM−EDS and XRD confirms the linkage between the enzyme and nanoparticle (CaO-Fe3O4) with the assistance of xylan aldehyde. Incorporation of CaO and xylan aldehyde along with the magnetic Fe3O4 improved the overall binding efficiency and residual activity of the enzyme. The metal nanoparticle linked α-amylase showed a significant increase in the hydrolysis of glycogen. Moreover, the immobilized enzyme was highly stable under various temperatures and pHs and could be reused with an estimated half life of 138.6 h based on 7 cycles experiments. Under optimized conditions, the glucose yield observed was 89% of theoretical maximum. Overall results indicate that the improved enzyme performance is ascribed to the combined action of metal nanoparticle and enzyme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85040170019,"We explore the quasistationary profile of a massive charged scalar field in a class of charged black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. We discuss how the linear term in the metric, which is a unique character of the dRGT massive gravity, affects the structure of the spacetime. Numerical calculations of the quasinormal modes are performed for a charged scalar field in the dRGT black hole background. For an asymptotically de Sitter (dS) black hole, an improved asymptotic iteration method is used to obtain the associated quasinormal frequencies. The unstable modes are found for the =0 case, and their corresponding real parts satisfy the superradiant condition. For =2, the results show that all the de Sitter black holes considered here are stable against a small perturbation. For an asymptotically dRGT anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, unstable modes are found with the frequency satisfying the superradiant condition. Effects of massive-gravity parameters are discussed. Analytic calculation reveals the unique diffusive nature of quasinormal modes in the massive-gravity model with the linear term. Numerical results confirm the existence of the characteristic diffusive modes in both the dS and AdS cases. © 2017 American Physical Society."
2-s2.0-85028470685,"In high-temperature applications such as hot sections of gas turbines, the sintering rate of the porous microstructure of a ceramic coating, and their mechanical and thermomechanical properties are important parameters for thermal barrier coating systems. In the present research, hardness, elastic modulus, thermal expansion, thermal stress and sintering rate of the porous microstructure of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and ceria-stabilized zirconia (CSZ) were investigated and compared using the thermal spray technique on IN738LC base metal in thermal cycling to 1100 °C. To determine the structural and phase characteristics of the coatings, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were employed. The experimental results showed that the CSZ coatings exhibit a considerably better sintering rate of the porous microstructure resulting in better mechanical, and thermomechanical properties when compared to the YSZ coatings. Moreover, the study of microstructures of coatings showed that the CSZ coating is formed with a laminar and porous structure, with pores being smaller and more uniform than those of the YSZ coating. © 2017"

2-s2.0-85032425979,"Insulin resistance is a major defect underlying type 2 diabetes development. Skeletal muscle tissue and adipocyte tissue are the major sites of postprandial glucose disposal, and enhancing glucose uptake into this tissue may decrease insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes patients. Mahanine (3,11-dihydro-3,5-dimethyl-3-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)pyrano[3,2-a]carbazol-9-ol) has been reported to be a major bioactive carbazole alkaloid that has many biological activities including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities. However, the molecular mechanism and signaling pathways mediating the anti-diabetic effects of mahanine require further investigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid from Murraya koenigii, on glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle and adipocyte cells. Mahanine treatment promoted a dose dependent increased in glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and adipocyte cells via activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Mahanine induced Akt-activation was reversed by co-treatment with wortmannin, an Akt inhibitor. Moreover, it was found that mahanine significantly enhanced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. These results suggest that increased activation of the Akt signaling pathway lead to increased plasma membrane GLUT4 content and increased glucose uptake. These data strongly suggest that mahanine has anti-diabetic potential for treating diabetes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

This study aimed at studying and comparing enteroendocrine, Musashi 1 (Msi 1) and neurogenin 3 (neurog 3) cells in Thai and Norwegian IBS patients. Material and methods: Thirty Thai and 61 Norwegian IBS patients as well as 20 Thai and 24 Norwegian controls were included. Biopsy samples were taken from each of the sigmoid colon and the rectum during a standard colonoscopy. The samples were immunostained for serotonin, peptide YY, oxyntomodulin, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, Msi 1 and neurog 3. The densities of immunoreactive cells were determined with computerized image analysis. Results: The densities of several enteroendocrine cell types were altered in both the colon and rectum of both Thai and Norwegian IBS patients. Some of these changes were similar in Thai and Norwegian IBS patients, while others differed. Conclusions: The findings of abnormal densities of the enteroendocrine cells in Thai patients support the notion that enteroendocrine cells are involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. The present observations highlight that IBS differs in Asian and Western countries, and show that the changes in large-intestine enteroendocrine cells in Thai and Norwegian IBS patients might be caused by different mechanisms. © 2017 The Author(s).

Objective: To delineate the medical and psychosocial factors associated with glycemic control in an unselected pediatric population with T1D. Methods: We included a cross-section of 58 adolescents (28 boys and 30 girls) aged 13.6 ± 4.0 years with T1D ≥1 year attending a well-established pediatric diabetes clinic in Thailand. Median diabetes duration was 4.1 years (range 1–18 years). Participants were divided into 2 subgroups according to their average HbA1c level over the past year. Those with good control (HbA1c <8%) (n = 13) were compared with those with poor control (HbA1c ≥8%) (n = 45). Data collected from self-report standardized questionnaires and medical records were used to compare variables between groups. Results: Adolescents with good control used significantly less daily insulin and had higher family income, higher scores for family support, and quality of life (QoL) than those in the group with poor control (P < 0.05). Age, sex, puberty, duration of diabetes, insulin regimen, frequency of blood glucose monitoring, and self-report adherence did not differ between groups. By univariate logistic regression, the only factor associated significantly with poor glycemic control was a QoL score <25. Conclusion: Adolescents with T1D may be at a higher risk of poor glycemic control if they have poor QoL, impaired family functioning, poor coping skills, and lower socioeconomic status, suggesting that psychosocial interventions could potentially improve glycemic control in this population. © 2017 Termpong Dumrisilp et al., published by Sciendo."

2-s2.0-85045692442,"Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Previous studies revealed that some autophagy-related genes expression was increased in the HCC cell lines and tissue samples when compared to the controls. However, the mechanism of these autophagy genes in HBV-related HCC is still unclear. Hence we aim to search for the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of autophagy-related genes associated with HCC. Two hundred and sixteen Thai patients with chronic HBV (CHB) infection (102 with HCC and 114 without HCC), 91 recovered individuals, and 131 healthy controls were recruited. The PCR-RFLP method and TaqMan allelic discrimination assay were applied to analyse eight SNPs including mTOR rs2295080, ATG7 rs2305686, ATG5 rs41292420, ATG5 rs77859116, ATG5 rs510432, IGF1 rs75960260, PIK3C3 rs3813065, and ATG16L1 rs2241880. Our study found that the A allele of ATG16L1 rs2241880 was associated with an increased risk in HCC as compared to CHB patients without HCC and healthy controls (OR = 1.62, P = 0.033; OR = 1.98, P = 0.002, respectively). The T allele of ATG5 rs77859116 was significantly associated with the risk to HCC as compared with CHB patients without HCC (OR = 23.61, P = 0.000007). Furthermore, we found that the combination of CT (rs41292420), TT (rs77859116), and CC (rs510432) genotypes of ATG5 conferred the risk to HCC, with the OR of the high-risk to low-risk group being 16.42 and P = 0.003. This study suggests that the polymorphisms of the ATG5 and ATG16L1 genes might be involved in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinogenesis in Thai. However, a functional study of these polymorphisms should be further confirmed. © 2017 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All Rights Reserved."

M. turicensis (CMtc). Here, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) targeting the 16S rRNA gene combined with malachite green (MG) based colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of feline CMhm infection. The limit of detection was determined using a ten-fold serial dilution of recombinant plasmid DNA (from 108 to 1 copies). The result indicated that the LAMP-MG assay could detect as low as 264 copies corresponding to 264 organisms/μl of CMhm feline blood. Comparison between the LAMP-MG and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveying 105 clinical samples suggested that 17 and 15 samples were positive for CMhm, respectively. Validity of the LAMP-MG assay was assessed and calculated within 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The sensitivity, specificity, prevalence and accuracy were 100.0%, 97.8%, 14.3%, and 98.1%, respectively. The degree of agreement between LAMP-MG and standard PCR assays was 92.6%, with a κ coefficient of 1 (CI: 82.5-100.0%). This LAMP-MG colorimetric assay may be applicable as a rapid screening point-ofcare testing for feline CMhm, as well as for blood donors prior to blood transfusion by using unsophisticated equipment, such as a heating block or water bath.

From the histological analysis, the longitudinal folds of the oesophagus were lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelia with goblet cells. The goblet cells stained positively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue (AB) methods. In the stomach, gastric glands extended into the lamina propria. Each gastric gland had a greater cell size than other regions and also a branched tubular gland was visible in the histological images. The mucous neck cell was positive to PAS and AB reactions, whereas, the oxynticopeptic cells slightly reacted to both PAS and AB staining and were preferentially located in this gland. The liver parenchyma of C. rynchops was composed of hepatic sinusoids and hepatocytes.

2-s2.0-85042529228,"Currently available tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer lack sufficient accuracy. There is a need to identify novel biomarkers for this common malignancy. SOX family genes play an important role in embryogenesis and are also implicated in various cancers. SOX11 has been recently recognized as a potential tumour suppressor that is downregulated in prostate cancer. We hypothesized that hypermethylation may be responsible for SOX11 silencing in human prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate SOX11 promoter methylation in prostate adenocarcinoma by comparing it with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 143 human prostate tissue samples, 62 from patients with prostate cancer and 81 from patients with BPH were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Associations between SOX11 promoter methylation and clinicopathological parameters were assessed by univariate statistics. Detection rates of SOX11 promoter methylation were 80.6% and 35.8% in prostate cancer and BPH respectively (P < 0.001). SOX11 hypermethylation was associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer, including higher PSA level (P < 0.01), Gleason score ≥ 7 (P = 0.03) and perineural invasion (P = 0.03). SOX11 methylation was positively correlated with the PSA level (P = 0.001).

The zinc hydroxide is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscope, X-ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscope measurements. The synthesized zinc hydroxide is a platelike structure with an average nano dimension of 40 nm in crystalline depth. The aim of the present study is to reduce the cure activator level of conventional environment pollutant zinc oxide in the vulcanization of natural rubber. To study the effects of the synthesized zinc hydroxide on the vulcanization of natural rubber curing, mechanical and thermal properties were determined and compared with the vulcanized properties of conventional 5 phr (per hundred grams of rubber) zinc oxide cured rubber vulcanizate. A strong enhancement in the cross-link density and mechanical properties (namely, modulus, tensile strength, and hardness) with only 2 phr of synthesized zinc hydroxide cured rubber system compared with 5 phr of conventional zinc oxide cured rubber system was found. A slightly higher thermal stability of 2 phr zinc hydroxide cured vulcanizate was observed because of better cross-link density than conventional 5 phr zinc oxide cured rubber vulcanizate. Thus, by this novel method, a greater than 60% reduction of the conventional cure activator level can be possible with improved physical properties in the vulcanization of natural rubber. © 2018 Rubber Division, ACS."

Sorption characteristics of the K-nZVI for the removal of Cu(II) ions was studied in batch conditions. The physical and chemical structure of the K-nZVI composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller studies (BET). The effect of pH, the initial metal ion concentration, and contact time on adsorption of Cu(II) onto K-nZVI was investigated. The K-nZVI exhibited good sorption performances over the initial pH range from 2.5 to 6.5. The kinetics data was studied by applying two sorption kinetic models (Pseudo-first and Pseudo-second-order) equations. The pseudo-second-order model was relatively suitable for describing the adsorption process. The equilibrium adsorption data is well fitted to Langmuir adsorption models. The maximum adsorption capacities of K-nZVI sorbent as obtained from Langmuir adsorption isotherm is found to be 178–200 mg g−1 for Cu(II). Sorption isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) were applied to the experimental data. The adsorption kinetics was well represented by the pseudo second order rate equation, and the adsorption isotherms were better fitted by the Langmuir equation. The thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption reaction of Cu(II) is endothermic processes.

Previous study showed the relationship between urinary cysteinyl leukotriene E 4 (uLTE 4 ) level and therapeutic response to montelukast in asthmatic adults. However, this relationship has never been investigated in pediatric OSA. Objectives: To determine the relationship between uLTE 4 level and therapeutic response to montelukast in children with ATH and mild OSA. Population and methods: Children aged 3-15 yrs who had ATH and mild OSA were enrolled. All had quality of life (QoL) (assessed by Thai version OSA-18 QoL questionnaire) and uLTE 4 levels measured prior to start a 6-week course of montelukast treatment. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) and QoL reassessment were performed after completing the treatment. Those who demonstrated a large improvement of mean total QoL score or ≥ 50% decrease of obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) after the treatment were defined as responders. Results: Twenty-six children were enrolled (mean age 7.5 ± 2.9 yrs, 38.5% male). After 6-week course of montelukast, nine (34.6%) children showed significant improvement. The mean uLTE 4 level from the responders was higher comparing to the non-responders (2,952.56 ± 966.9 vs. 978.6 ± 460.8 pg/mg creatinine; p < 0.001). uLTE 4 level of ≥ 1,457 pg/mg creatinine had 100% sensitivity and 88.2% specificity in identifying the responders. Conclusions: We found the association between ULTE4 and therapeutic response to monteleukast. The uLTE 4 level of ≥ 1,457 pg/mg creatinine could predict the therapeutic response to montelukast in children who had ATH and mild OSA. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

They could be traced back to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) scale and are aligned to GPST. This paper estimates the receiver clock offsets to three timescales: GPST, GLONASST and BDT. The two measurement scenarios use two identical multi-GNSS geodetic receivers connected to the same geodetic antenna through a splitter. One receiver is driven by its internal oscillators and another receiver is connected to the external frequency oscillators, caesium frequency standard, kept as the Thailand standard time scale at the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand) called UTC(NIMT). The three weeks data are observed at 30 seconds sample rate. The receiver clock offsets with respected to the three system time are estimated and analysed through the geodetic technique of static Precise Point Positioning (PPP) using a data processing software developed by Wuhan University - Positioning And Navigation Data Analyst (PANDA) software. The estimated receiver clock offsets are around 32, 33 and 18 nanoseconds from GPST, GLONASST and BDT respectively.

2-s2.0-85038612821,"For the first time a principle-component analysis is used to separate out different orthogonal modes of the two-particle correlation matrix from heavy ion collisions. The analysis uses data from sNN=2.76TeV PbPb and sNN=5.02TeV pPb collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Two-particle azimuthal correlations have been extensively used to study hydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions. Recently it was shown that the expected factorization of two-particle results into a product of the constituent single-particle anisotropies is broken. The new information provided by these modes may shed light on the breakdown of flow factorization in heavy ion collisions. The first two modes (""leading"" and ""subleading"") of two-particle correlations are presented for elliptical and triangular anisotropies in PbPb and pPb collisions as a function of pT over a wide range of event activity. The leading mode is found to be essentially equivalent to the anisotropy harmonic previously extracted from two-particle correlation methods. The subleading mode represents a new experimental observable and is shown to account for a large fraction of the factorization breaking recently observed at high transverse momentum. The principle-component analysis technique was also applied to multiplicity fluctuations. These also show a subleading mode. The connection of these new results to previous studies of factorization is discussed. ©2017 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

2-s2.0-85040704260,"A novel hybridization of esterification and transesterification processes in a single reactive distillation column was proposed for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. Continuous process operation was designed in a single reactive distillation column using two different types of heterogeneous catalyst. Amberlyst-15 was loaded on the top of reactive section to eliminate free fatty acid via esterification and CaO/Al2O3 was loaded at the lower section for biodiesel synthesis via transesterification. Suitable design parameters and operating conditions were determined by process simulation using commercial Aspen Plus program. The hybridized process via reactive distillation could reduce the number of equipment, methanol to oil in feed and energy consumption compared to the conventional alkaline catalyzed process and the process of two reactive distillation columns in series (packing with Amberlyst-15 and CaO/Al2O3). Net specific energy requirement was achieved to the lower value as 216 kWhr/kmol biodiesel (or 197 kWhr/kmol biodiesel with allocation to 98% purity of glycerol byproduct). This value is lower than that from the conventional process and also the two reactive distillation columns in series of 665 and 224 kWhr/kmol biodiesel, respectively. Moreover, increasing pressure in the hybridized column from 1 to 3 bar decreased the number of reactive stage from 24 stages (4 esterification and 20 transesterification) to 8 stages (3 esterification and 5 transesterification). Several feedstocks with different FFA content can be operated in this hybridization ester- and transesterification column within the 8 reactive stages with flexible of number of catalyst packing stage (acid and alkali catalysts) under column pressure of 3 bar. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Thirty two female C57Bl/6Mlac mice were fed with modified AIN 93G diets by replacing cornstarch in the original composition with white rice (WR), BR and R-BR powder. The mice were divided into 4 groups and fed with the following experimental diets for 4 weeks: (1) negative control (WR: diet with WR), (2) positive control (DSS_WR: DSS and diet with WR), (3) DSS_BR: DSS and diet with BR, and (4) DSS_R-BR: DSS and diet with R-BR. BR and R-BR had a greater content of fat, dietary fiber, GABA, γ-oryzanol, γ-tocotrienol, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid than WR (p < 0.05). No significant difference in the level of these bioactive compounds was noted between BR and R-BR. Nevertheless, R-BR had a 1.8 fold resistant starch (RS) content of BR (p < 0.05). The DSS_BR and DSS_R-BR groups showed a lower ratio of colonic weight to length, and a lower content of iNOS, COX-2, MPO, IL-6 and INF-γ in colonic homogenates than the DSS_WR group. However, the DSS treated mice fed with the R-BR diet had significantly milder histopathological inflammatory injury and lower colonic iNOS expression than the DSS_BR and DSS_WR groups. The percentage of mesenteric regulatory T cells significantly increased in the DSS_R-BR group compared to that in the DSS_WR group. The DSS treated mice fed with the R-BR diet showed a significant increase in cecal bacterial diversity and abundance of genera Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Coprococcus and Dehalobacterium but a significant decrease in pathogenic bacteria including Bacteroides and Enterococcus compared to the DSS_WR group. Thus, the present data indicate that BR and R-BR ameliorate colonic inflammation in experimental colitis induced by DSS in mice by suppressing inflammatory mediators and modulating regulatory T cell responses as well as bacterial diversity in the cecum. © The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2-s2.0-85040722165,"Aims: The objective of this research was to isolate, screen and identify phytase-producing bacteria from soils and a potent isolate was selected for its phytase production. Methodology and results: Eight spore-forming bacteria isolated from agricultural soils in Thailand were screened for their phytase production. They were identified as Bacillus and Paenibacillus strains based on their phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. The phytase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CH3-1 [Group I(a)] was 20.956 ± 0.099 U/mL, while Bacillus subtilis SR9-3 [Group I(b)] produced 20.588 ± 0.099 U/mL. Five isolates in Group I(c), identified as Bacillus aryabhattai, produced phytase at levels ranging from 2.436 ± 0.116 to 20.910 ± 0.000 U/mL, while Paenibacillus cineris CM5-3 (Group II) produced 1.261 ± 0.111 U/mL. A potent strain, CH3-1, produced the highest phytase when cultivated in Phytate Specific Medium (PSM) supplemented with 1% glucose, at pH 7.0 and incubated at 45 °C.

The incidence within 24 hours, the score of severity by a four-point Likert Scale, the incidences of vomiting, and itching were also compared. Results: Comparing the incidence of nausea between ondansetron and control groups, they were similar during the first breastfeeding (24.2% vs. 37.5%) and 24 hours postdelivery (3.8% vs. 10.0%), (p = 0.07 and 0.13). The number required the rescued antiemetic in the PACU in the ondansetron group was less (5.1% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.02), but the other observed incidences and severity of nausea were similar to the control group. By regression analyses, the factors that reduced the nausea incidence in the PACU were ondansetron administration (p = 0.04, adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96), and the history of previous cesarean delivery (p = 0.04, adjusted OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.98). By contrast, postdelivery methylergometrine administration increased the incidence (p = 0.04, adjusted OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 10.40). At 24 hours postdelivery, only the history of PONV increased the incidence (p = 0.04, adjusted OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 7.12). Conclusion: The incidence of nausea was reduced by prophylactic ondansetron in the PACU, but was not significantly different during breastfeeding on the same day and 24 hours postoperatively. Therapeutic ondansetron may be appropriate and an economical practice. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85040114563,"Larvae of many insect species, including stag beetles, have a limited mobility from their initial oviposition site. The fate of immature stages, therefore, depends on the maternal choice of oviposition site. Decaying wood preference by stag beetles was studied in a dry-evergreen forest in Chanthaburi province, Thailand. From a total of 270 examined logs, 52 contained stag beetles (255 total), which were identified to eight species from five genera. Aegus chelifer chelifer MacLeay, 1819 (Coleoptera: Lucanidae) was the dominant species both by occurrence and by number of individuals. The occurrence and numbers of stag beetle larvae found in logs was more frequent in those of a moderate decay class, which had moderate hardness and water content. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that logs with stag beetles had relatively high nitrogen content and fungal biomass. Thus, selection of oviposition sites by stag beetles was likely to depend on both the log decay stage (or hardness) to protect immature stages from natural enemies and its nutritional properties to enhance the larval performance. © 2017 The Authors."
2-s2.0-85040241772,"Background: Postoperative pain is the most common problem during perioperative period. An inadequate postoperative pain control causes numerous undesirable consequences. Patient satisfaction, an indicator reflecting quality of care in hospitals, depends on the management of pain. Objective: To evaluate the factors affecting patient satisfaction after epidural analgesia in a tertiary care center. Material and Method: Two hundred sixty-two patients who met the criterion in Acute Pain Service at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between October 2013 and September 2014 were enrolled in the present prospective cohort study. Demographic data, perioperative management related to analgesia, numerical pain score (NPS = 0 to 10), patient satisfaction score (0 to 10; 0 = worst, 10 = best), side effects, and problems resulting from epidural analgesia were recorded. Results: Two hundred thirty-seven patients (90.5%) rated overall satisfaction score greater than 7. The median (range) overall satisfaction score of receiving epidural analgesia was 9 (3 to 10). The factors associated with increasing satisfaction score were duration of indwelling epidural catheter at three days or less, p = 0.022, OR = 0.13 (0.023 to 0.750), and low pain score, p = 0.009, OR = 0.03 (0.003 to 0.426). The factor related to dissatisfaction was motor weakness of lower extremities, p = 0.012, OR = 15.05 (1.815 to 124.723). Conclusion: Majority of patients reported high level of satisfaction of pain management relating to epidural analgesia. Decreasing duration of indwelling epidural catheter and low pain score promoted satisfaction whereas motor weakness affected patient dissatisfaction. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

2-s2.0-85039172717,"A one-and-a-half-year-old Shih-Tzu bitch went into natural labor after full term of her first pregnancy, giving birth to 4 puppies. One of them was a male which died at birth, 104 grams in weight and 12 centimeters in length. This puppy showed several facial abnormalities and skeletal deformities. It was preserved in 10% formalin for anatomical, histopathological, and radiographic studies. Gross anatomical study revealed congenital anomalies of the eyes including anophthalmia of the left eye and microphthalmia of the right eye. Malformations of the ears including anotia of the left ear and microtia of the right ear were observed. Evidence of cleft lips was also noted. There was a membrane-bound mass emerging from the center of the face and replacing the nose. Histopathological sections of the mass revealed evidence of nervous tissues composed of neurons and their supporting cells including microglia and astrocytes. Radiographs showed incomplete formation of frontal bones where the herniation of the mass occurred. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of frontoethmoidal meningoencephalocele. Additionally, deformities of the 1st to the 3rd cervical vertebrae, the 3rd and lower thoracic vertebrae, and all lumbar vertebrae were found. Rib deformity was observed at both sides and rib fusion was presented on the right side. In conclusion, this study shows a rare case of a stillbirth puppy that possessed frontoethmoidal meningoencephalocele associated with multiple facial and skeletal abnormalities."
2-s2.0-85040064175,"Powerful straight punches create strategic advantage for boxers. However, there is discrepancy in theoretical and practical understandings of how to deliver powerful straight punches. This paper attempted to investigate the role of trunk rotation in straight punches. Trunk rotation was suggested as a critical component in delivering straight punches. However, no research has yet to address the importance of trunk rotation in straight punches. Three professional boxers who competed regularly in Muay Thai and boxing were recruited in this study. Both kinematic and kinetic analysis were performed. Straight punches were dissected into stages using ground reaction force. The result showed straight punches had 3 stages, i.e., (1) starting position, (2) lead toe off, and (3) lead toe in. The results suggested that the final stage, lead toe in, was the most important in delivering powerful straight punches, and boxers used trunk rotation to transform vertical ground reaction force to horizontal punch force. © 2017, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

2-s2.0-85039172188,"Eating behavior is influenced by various external stimuli, including food and ambient temperature (Ta). In dairy animals, high ambient temperature (HTa) decreases eating and subsequently reduces milk production. Eight crossbred non-lactating Saanen goats in late pregnancy fed under HTa condition were used to investigate the normal eating behavior by comparing the short-term eating pattern of control with 2% coconut oil supplemented formulations. The goats were fed ad libitum twice daily a total mix ration with free access to water. The experiment lasted 17 days, 9 days for adaptation and 8 days for data collection. Meal patterns were determined on the last day of experiment. The short-term 2% coconut oil supplementation (0.91±0.08 kg/day) did not affect daily dry matter intake (DMI) as compared with the control (0.83±0.05 kg/day). However, daytime DMI of the coconut oil supplemented group (0.82±0.05 kg) was higher than that of the control group (0.57±0.06 kg/day). This effect was derived primarily from the longer eating duration and meal duration during daytime and the bigger meal size during spontaneous meals. The present results suggested that, under HTa condition, the spontaneous meal, rather than the scheduled meal, was first deviated by the new diet. Another aspect of the normal eating pattern in crossbred dairy goats was the crepuscular eating pattern which could not be replaced by the scheduled afternoon feeding. This finding suggested that under HTa, the crepuscular eating is the norm, and modification in the afternoon feeding schedule should be considered to avoid the effect of HTa."
2-s2.0-85039151846,"Cloacal papilloma is commonly found in Amazon parrots and macaws. There are many treatment options for cloacal papilloma. Chemical cautery is one of the recommended methods. In this study, 6 mature chestnut-fronted macaws (Ara severus) with cloacal papilloma were treated weekly with 50% silver nitrate solution. All tumors completely regressed after 2 to 5 weeks of treatment. One bird died after the second treatment from another cause. Three months after the last treatment, one bird died from internal papilloma in the esophagus and the crop. Recurrence was found in one bird at 6 months after the last treatment. The result suggested that cauterization with 50% silver nitrate solution was effective in the treatment of cloacal papilloma in macaws. However, recurrence of the tumor or papilloma in the gastrointestinal tract could be observed."

The particles, identified via their energy loss in the silicon tracker, are measured in the transverse momentum range of pT ∼ 0.1-1.7 GeV/c and rapidities /y/ < 1. The pT spectra and integrated yields are compared to previous results at smaller √s and to predictions of Monte Carlo event generators. The average pT increases with particle mass and charged particle multiplicity of the event. Comparisons with previous CMS results at √s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV show that the average pT and the ratios of hadron yields feature very similar dependences on the particle multiplicity in the event, independently of the center-of-mass energy of the pp collision. © 2017 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration."
2-s2.0-85039838392,"The community of Thai native textiles plays an important role in the cultural heritage of Thailand and serves as appreciable symbols in the human investigation of philosophy and cultural values. In a context of a changing world, it has automatically affected the ways in which Thais are developing their cultural heritage. With the purpose of preserving their original cultural framework, while confronted with modernization, such that they still enjoy happiness within a sustainable livelihood, the textile-community development paradigm was investigated. The Thai native textile, full of creativity and with its own identity, was continuously produced throughout Thailand. An interesting community model leads to management for preservation and use of cultural heritage applying community-driven development without loss of well-being in the context of the present. However, the factors that cause or contribute to the living of people in the community that still maintains its cultural heritage were not found. In order to achieve this aim, a study of how the sufficiency economy philosophy (SEP) and Buddhist concepts affect the Thai native textile community was undertaken. The objective of this study was to discover the impact of the sufficiency economy (SE) and Buddhism on the livelihood of Thais in the native textile community. The main purpose of this study was to find a holistic approach in which essential obligations that can affect the textile community's sustainable development have been applied to the daily living of the local people, influencing their continued happiness and sustainability. A case study was taken up in the native textile community in Mae Chaem District of Chiang Mai Province in northern of Thailand, where empirical evidence was found that many communities around this area translated the principles of Buddhism into their ways of living. The SE and Buddhist concepts have an effect on the relationship between human individuals, their social norms and nature itself that leads to the textile production which this study explored in terms of design, production, and practical application. The textile patterns were inspired by allegorical stories that characterize their design features. Their production did not encroach upon the environment. Textiles used in daily life were epitomized by the concept of impermanence in Buddhism. The concept of moral economies was applied, and traditions of giving, helping, and sharing provided self-sufficiency and happiness while emphasizing the protection of nature from human encroachment."
2-s2.0-85039151515,"The effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG) on zebrafish, Danio rerio, embryo was investigated at different concentrations of ten-fold dilution of ten times lesser than the median lethal concentration (LC50). Zebrafish embryos in the MSG treated groups (40,000 ppm and 80,000 ppm) reached highest mortality rate at 100 % within 48 hpf and 96 hpf which is significantly different (p < 0.05) from negative control group. According to the Probit analysis, the LC50 of MSG on zebrafish embryo at 48 hpf and 96 hpf were 15,200 ppm and 10,300 ppm, respectively. Under the observation, effects based on the toxicity endpoint composed of lethal, sublethal and malformation effects appeared within 144 hpf. Exposure to MSG at 1,500 ppm and 150 ppm significantly produced sublethal effects and malformation development to zebrafish embryo. MSG induced cardiotoxic effects in zebrafish embryo was observed at 15, 150 and 1,500 ppm. Our results demonstrate that zebra fish embryo is a good model for the detection of toxic potential of chemical substances. Also, our data suggest the need to reconsider the safety of MSG and elucidate its mechanism of adverse reaction in further studies."

Such topologies can be produced in gauge-mediated supersymmetry models in which pair-produced gluinos or squarks decay to photons and gravitinos via short-lived neutralinos. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. No significant excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed. The data are interpreted in simplified models of gluino and squark pair production, in which gluinos or squarks decay via neutralinos to photons. Gluino masses of up to 1.50-2.00 TeV and squark masses up to 1.30-1.65 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the neutralino mass and branching fraction.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85038931435,"Objectives: Oral mucositis is a major cause of pain and delayed cancer treatment leading to poor survival in head and neck cancer patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation. The study evaluated the effect of adjuvant melatonin on minimizing oral mucositis complications to reduce these treatment delays and interruptions. Design: A randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: Ubon Ratchathani Cancer Hospital, Thailand. Participants: Thirty-nine head and neck cancer patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation (5 days/week of radiation plus chemotherapy three or six cycles). Methods: Patients were randomized to receive 20 mg melatonin gargle (or matched placebo) before each irradiation, and 20 mg melatonin capsules (or matched placebo) taken nightly during 7 weeks of concurrent chemoradiation. Endpoints were oral mucositis events (incidence and time to grade 3 mucositis or grade 2 xerostomia), pain medication consumption and quality of life (QOL). Results: Melatonin group reported lower incidence of grade 3 oral mucositis (42% vs. 55%) and grade 2 xerostomia (20% vs. 21%); no statistical significance was detected. Melatonin regimen delayed onset of grade 3 mucositis (median 34 days vs. 50 days; p = 0.0318), allowing median time of 16 more patient visits before its onset and fewer interrupted treatments due to oral mucositis were reported (n = 1 vs. n = 5). There was no difference of grade 2 xerostomia (median 32 days vs. 50 days; p = 0.624). Morphine consumption was also reduced (median 57 mg vs. 0 mg; p = 0.0342), while QOL was comparable during the study period. Conclusion: Adjuvant melatonin delayed the onset of oral mucositis, which enables uninterrupted cancer treatment and reduced the amount of morphine used for pain treatment. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
2-s2.0-85039147109,"The present study was aimed to investigate body condition, hepatic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF binding protein (BP)-1 and growth hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA abundance and specific energy metabolites in association with delayed ovarian resumption in Holstein lactating cows. Of 10 cows studied, 5 cows had normal ovarian resumption (NR group), whereas the remaining 5 cows had delayed ovarian resumption (AB group) within 7 wks after calving. No significant differences in mean BW and BCS between the two groups were observed (P > 0.05). In addition, mean hepatic IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and GHR mRNA abundance of the NR and AB groups was not significantly different (P > 0.05). Mean non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels of the two groups were elevated, particularly at 1 wk after calving, but no significant differences between the two groups were observed (P > 0.05). In contrast, differences in mean beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels between the NR and AB groups were significant (P = 0.047) and mean BHB levels at 3 and 5 wks after calving of the AB group were higher than those of the NR group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the effects of BW, BCS, hepatic IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and GHR mRNA abundance and NEFA levels were not observed, but a degree of negative energy balance (NEB), indicated by the elevated BHB levels during the early postpartum period, was associated with the occurrence of delayed resumption of ovarian activity in the Holstein lactating cows."

To analyze these phenomena, we designed our research using Web Crawlers and Twitter Advanced Search (https://twitter.com/search-advanced) to collect and analyze tweets. We started our tweets collecting by keywords and hashtags relating to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. From the data, we have found that several events that were not the main ones are also interesting.

Moreover, we analyzed users' behavior comparing to tweets in normal situations and explored the distribution based on geolocation embedded in the tweets."
2-s2.0-85038591932,"Soft behaviours of S-matrix for massless theories reflect the underlying symmetry principle that enforces its masslessness. As an expansion in soft momenta, sub-leading soft theorems can arise either due to (I) unique structure of the fundamental vertex or (II) presence of enhanced broken-symmetries. While the former is expected to be modified by infrared or ultraviolet divergences, the latter should remain exact to all orders in perturbation theory. Using current algebra, we clarify such distinction for spontaneously broken (super) Poincaré and (super) conformal symmetry. We compute the UV divergences of DBI, conformal DBI, and A-V theory to verify the exactness of type (II) soft theorems, while type (I) are shown to be broken and the soft-modifying higher-dimensional operators are identified. As further evidence for the exactness of type (II) soft theorems, we consider the α′ expansion of both super and bosonic open strings amplitudes, and verify the validity of the translation symmetry breaking soft-theorems up to O(α′6). Thus the massless S-matrix of string theory “knows” about the presence of D-branes. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85038264240,"Injury of the periodontium followed by inflammatory response often leads to root resorption. Resorption is accomplished by osteoclasts and their generation may depend on an interaction with the cells in direct contact with the root, the cementoblasts. Our study aimed to investigate the role of human cementoblasts in the formation of osteoclasts and the effect of interleukin (IL)-1β hereupon. Extracted teeth from healthy volunteers were subjected to sequential digestion by type I collagenase and trypsin. The effect of enzymatic digestion on the presence of cells on the root surface was analyzed by histology. Gene expression of primary human cementoblasts (pHCB) was compared with a human cementoblast cell line (HCEM). The pHCBs were analyzed for their expression of IL-1 receptors as well as of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). In a co-culture system consisting of osteoclast precursors (blood monocytes) and pHCBs, the formation of osteoclasts and their resorptive activity was assessed by osteo-assay and ivory slices. The cells obtained after a 120 min enzyme digestion expressed the highest level of bone sialoprotein, similar to that of HCEM. This fraction of isolated cells also shared a similar expression pattern of IL-1 receptors (IL1-R1 and IL1-R2). Treatment with IL-1β potently upregulated RANKL expression but not of OPG. pHCBs were shown to induce the formation of functional osteoclasts. This capacity was significantly stimulated by pretreating the pHCBs with IL-1β prior to their co-culture with human blood monocytes. Our study demonstrated that cementoblasts have the capacity to induce osteoclastogenesis, a capacity strongly promoted by IL-1β. These results may explain why osteoclasts can be formed next to the root of teeth."

Detailed understanding of length, width, point of insertion and the relationships between these muscles could be of significance for successful surgical outcomes. Forty-six orbital contents were extracted from formaldehyde-embalmed cadavers. Dissection was performed to reveal the extraocular muscles from their origins to insertions on the sclera. Muscle length, muscle width, distance from point of insertion to the sclerocorneal limbus, relationship between the superior oblique and superior rectus and between the inferior oblique and lateral rectus were measured. The lateral rectus and superior rectus were the longest muscles. The insertion of the medial rectus muscle was closest to the sclerocorneal limbus while the inferior rectus, lateral rectus and superior rectus insertions were progressively further apart. Only the length of the inferior rectus and medial rectus were significantly different between males and females. The distances between the superior oblique and superior rectus and between the inferior oblique and lateral rectus were slightly greater than in previous study. A direct comparison of these parameters between ethnic groups is still needed for an improvement of the procedural outcomes. © Copyright 2017 Via Medica."
2-s2.0-85038907577,"Influenza virus evolves rapidly due to the accumulated genetic variations on the viral sequence. Unlike in North America and Europe, influenza season in the tropical Southeast Asia spans both the rainy and cool seasons. Thus, influenza epidemiology and viral evolution sometimes differ from other regions, which affect the ever-changing efficacy of the vaccine. To monitor the current circulating influenza viruses in this region, we determined the predominant influenza virus strains circulating in Thailand between January 2016 and June 2017 by screening 7,228 samples from patients with influenza-like illness. During this time, influenza A(H3N2) virus was the predominant influenza virus detected. We then phylogenet-ically compared the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from a subset of these A(H3N2) strains (n = 62) to the reference sequences and evaluated amino acid changes in the dominant antigenic epitopes on the HA protein structure. The divergence of the circulating A(H3N2) from the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine strain formed five genetic groups (designated I to V) within the 3C.2a clade. Our results suggest a marked drift of the current circulating A(H3N2) strains in Thailand, which collectively contributed to the declining predicted vaccine effectiveness (VE) from 74% in 2016 down to 48% in 2017. © 2017 Suntronwong et al.

So the Government of Thailand has announced to all government agencies, including public schools, to reduce their energy consumption. However, it is not simple to fulfill this task due to many obstacles, called ""Barriers"". The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of a gamification method, which enables schools to create energy saving behavior among its students. A pilot case study was programmed at Sri Ayudhya School where a game named ""Power School"" was played by 134 students and the data collected using CCTV and questionnaires. Paired t-test statistics was used to evaluate the students' behavior from participating students and their parents after the pilot study, combined with the records from CCTV. The results from this paper highlight how gamification has significant positive effectiveness to a student's energy saving behavior at 95% confidence. Therefore, it can be seen that this gamification method is an alternative tool for public schools to improve the energy saving behavior of their students, which can affect the total energy consumption of the schools going forward."
2-s2.0-85037035609,"Effects of size, shape, and pyrene doping on electronic properties of graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) were theoretically investigated using density functional theory method with PBE, B3PW91, and M06-2X functionals and cc-pVDZ basis set. Two shapes of zigzag GNFs, hexagonal (HGN) and rhomboidal (RGN), were considered. The energy band gap of GNF depends on shape and decreases with size. The HGN has larger band gap energy (1.23–3.96 eV) than the RGN (0.13–2.12 eV). The doping of pyrene and pyrene derivatives on both HGN and RGN was also studied. The adsorption energy of pyrene and pyrene derivatives on GNF does not depend on the shape of GNFs with energies between 21 and 27 kcal mol−1. The substituent on pyrene enhances the binding to GNF but the strength does not depend on electron withdrawing or donating capability. The doping by pyrene and pyrene derivatives also shifts the HOMO and LUMO energies of GNFs. Both positive (destabilizing) and negative (stabilizing) shifts on HOMO and LUMO of GNFs were seen. The direction and magnitude of the shift do not follow the electron withdrawing and donating capability of pyrene substituents. However, only a slight shift was observed for doped RGN. A shift of 0.19 eV was noticed for HOMO of HGN doped with 1-aminopyrene (pyNH2) and of 0.04 eV for LUMO of HGN doped with 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (pyCOOH). © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
2-s2.0-85036619587,"The seismic activities and hazards in People's Democratic Republic Laos were analyzed using the most up-to-date seismicity data. Both the a-and b-values of the frequency-magnitude distribution model, including the return period of earthquake magnitude in the range of 5.0-6.0 Mw, were evaluated spatially in a region that extends 300 km from Laos. Six seismic source zones with different seismic activities were found. Based on these seismic source zones and a suitable attenuation model, seismic hazards were then analyzed in both deterministic and probabilistic scenarios. The deterministic map showed a possible maximum ground shaking up to 0.4 g in Northern Laos, whereas the ground shaking calculated from the probabilistic approach was < 0.32 g for 2% probability of exceedance in the next 50 yr. The probability of exceedance of an earthquake with a Modified Mercalli intensity scale of level IV-V, VI and VII in Laos in the next 50 yr was > 90, 70-90, and 20-40%, respectively, and was higher in the northern part. From these seismic activities and hazard analyses, Laos can be clearly separated into the three hazard zones of northwestern, northeastern and southern Laos with a high, medium and low earthquake hazard, respectively. Therefore, effective mitigation plans to reduce the impact of seismic hazards should be formulated and in particular for a number of major provinces located in the northern part of Laos."

Upregulation of AREG in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues has been shown to correlate with depth of tumor invasion, nerve invasion and liver metastasis. We sought to investigate a correlation of serum AREG in CRC with clinicopathological parameters. Methods: Patients with CRC receiving treatment at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during August 2013 to March 2014 were enrolled. We collected baseline serum prior to start any therapy and stored till analysis. Serum AREG was measured by ELISA. The correlation between each clinicopathological characteristic and serum AREG was analysed. Results: There were 120 patients with CRC including 78 patients (65.0%) with stage I-III and 41 patients (34.2%) in stage IV or recurrent disease. In stage IV or recurrent group, the median level of serum AREG was 31.55 pg/mL, which was higher than those of stage I-III group, 15.48 pg/mL, P=0.001. The serum AREG higher than 25 pg/mL (high serum AREG) was significantly correlated with liver and peritoneal metastasis (P < 0.001). Additionally, high serum AREG was significantly correlated with more poor differentiated/mucinous histological grade (P=0.014), distant metastasis (P=0.001), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.016) and perineural invasion (P < 0.001).

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radotinib as first-line therapy for CML-CP. Experimental Design: This multinational, open-label study assigned patients (1:1:1) to one of two twice-daily radotinib doses, or imatinib daily. The primary endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months. Results: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized to receive radotinib 300 mg (n ¼ 79) or 400 mg twice-daily (n ¼ 81), or imatinib 400 mg daily (n ¼ 81). MMR rates by 12 months were higher in patients receiving radotinib 300 mg (52%) or radotinib 400 mg twice-daily (46%) versus imatinib (30%; P ¼ 0.0044 and P ¼ 0.0342, respectively). Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates by 12 months were higher for radotinib 300 mg (91%) versus imatinib (77%; P ¼ 0.0120). Early molecular response at 3 months occurred in 86% and 87% of patients receiving radotinib 300 mg and radotinib 400 mg, respectively, and 71% of those receiving imatinib. By 12 months, no patients had progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis. Most adverse events were manageable with dose reduction.

2-s2.0-85037069104,"p120-Catenin (p120) functions as a tumor suppressor in intestinal cancer, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, using conditional p120 knockout in Apc-sensitized mouse models of intestinal cancer, we have identified p120 as an “obligatory” haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Whereas monoallelic loss of p120 was associated with a significant increase in tumor multiplicity, loss of both alleles was never observed in tumors from these mice. Moreover, forced ablation of the second allele did not further enhance tumorigenesis, but instead induced synthetic lethality in combination with Apc loss of heterozygosity. In tumor-derived organoid cultures, elimination of both p120 alleles resulted in caspase-3–dependent apoptosis that was blocked by inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK). With ROCK inhibition, however, p120-ablated organoids exhibited a branching phenotype and a substantial increase in cell proliferation. Access to data from Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis screens afforded an opportunity to directly assess the tumorigenic impact of p120 haploinsufficiency relative to other candidate drivers. Remarkably, p120 ranked third among the 919 drivers identified. Cofactors α-catenin and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) were also among the highest scoring candidates, indicating a mechanism at the level of the intact complex that may play an important role at very early stages of of intestinal tumorigenesis while simultaneously restricting outright loss via synthetic lethality."
2-s2.0-85035045789,"Thermo- and pH-responsive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) nanogels can be obtained by copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) comonomer through differential microemulsion polymerization. The effects of comonomer, cross-linker, surfactant contents, and water/oil ratio were preliminarily investigated by a 24 full factorial design in order to eliminate the insignificant parameters from the polymerization analysis. The smallest poly(NIPAM-co-AA) nanogel particles were 40 ± 1 nm in diameter with 6 wt% of solid content and 98% conversion without coagulation. The comonomer amounts controlled the morphologies and LCST of the poly(NIPAM-co-AA) nanogels. The hairy microgels of poly(NIPAM-co-AA) with a 10:90 mol ratio of AA/ NIPAM had a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 6 °C. With an increase in the AA amount to a 17 mol ratio, the LCST increased to 27 °C, resulting in core-shell morphology. The morphology of resultant nanogels was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to calculate the mole ratio of NIPAM and AA in resultant nanogels after dialysis. Both nanogel mole ratio and morphology effectively retained the cationic anti-cancer drug of methylene blue for several hours, an important basic requirement for a drug delivery system. Compared to core-shell microgels, a higher methylene blue release was obtained from the hairy microgels in simulated intestinal fluid. © 2017, Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute."

2-s2.0-85034767138,"This research proposed an advance in the prediction of the in-process surface roughness during the ball-end milling process by utilizing the wavelet transform to monitor and decompose the dynamic cutting forces. The chatter detection system has been adopted from the previous research of the author to avoid the chatter first, and hence, the dynamic cutting force ratio is introduced to predict the in-process surface roughness during the normal cutting by taking the ratio of the decomposed dynamic cutting force in X axis to that in Z axis. The Daubechies wavelet transform is employed in this research to analyze the in-process surface roughness. The experimentally obtained results showed that the surface roughness frequency occurred at the same level of the decomposed dynamic cutting forces although the cutting conditions are changed. It is understood that the in-process surface roughness can be predicted effectively under various cutting conditions referring to the proposed monitoring system. © 2015, © IMechE 2015."
2-s2.0-85034848016,"Objectives: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive platelet disorder, caused by defects of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (GPIIb/IIIa) resulting from pathogenic mutations in either ITGA2B or ITGB3. It is characterized by spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding. The molecular features of GT in Thailand have not been identified. This study aimed to determine the clinical and molecular features of unrelated Thai patients with GT. Methods: Four patients with clinically suspected GT were recruited at the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. The diagnosis was based on clinical and hematological parameters as well as genetic analysis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in all cases. Results: Of the four patients studied, the median age at first suspicion of GT was 2.5 years. All presented with severe bleeding symptoms (WHO bleeding scale 3). Flow cytometry to assess the surface GPIIb/IIIa complex showed reduced expression. By WES, we successfully identified seven mutant alleles in ITGA2B. One alteration, the c.2915dup (p.Leu973Alafs*63), was detected in two unrelated families. One patient was homozygous for the c.617T>A (p.Val206Asp). Of the five different mutations, three have never been previously described. These include a missense, c.617T>A (p.Val206Asp), a deletion, c.1524_1533del (p.Gln508Hisfs*3), and a nonsense, c.2344C>T (p.Arg782Ter).

2-s2.0-85034734832,"The aim of this research is to monitor and classify the broken chip signals from the dynamic cutting forces, in order to predict the surface roughness during the computer numerical control turning process utilizing the Meyer wavelet transform to decompose the dynamic cutting forces. The dynamic cutting forces of the broken chips and the surface roughness can be decomposed into the different levels. The levels of decomposed cutting forces can aid to explain the broken chip formation and the surface roughness profile in both time and frequency domains. The experimentally obtained results showed that the surface roughness frequency occurs at the higher level of decomposed cutting forces, especially at the fifth level, although the cutting conditions are changed. However, the chip breaking frequency appears at the lower level, which depends on the cutting conditions and the chip length. The ratio of the fifth level of decomposed feed forces to that of main forces is proposed to predict the surface roughness during the in-process cutting. It is understood that the broken chip formation can be separated clearly and the surface roughness can be predicted well during the cutting, regardless of the cutting conditions. © 2016, © IMechE 2016."
2-s2.0-85037043573,"Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a common cause of vasculopathy due to direct endothelial damage (such as post-coronary revascularization) or indirect injury (such as chronic kidney disease, or CKD). Although the attenuation of coronary revascularization-induced IH (direct-vascular-injury-induced IH) by cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been demonstrated, our understanding of the effect on CKD-induced IH (indirect-vascular-injury-induced IH) is limited. Herein, we tested if cilostazol attenuated CKD-induced IH in a mouse model of ischemic-reperfusion injury with unilateral nephrectomy (Chr I/R), a normotensive non-proteinuria CKD model. Cilostazol (50 mg/kg/day) or placebo was orally administered once daily from 1-week post-nephrectomy. At 20 weeks, cilostazol significantly attenuated aortic IH as demonstrated by a 34% reduction in the total intima area with 50% and 47% decreases in the ratios of tunica intima area/tunica media area and tunica intima area/(tunica intima + tunica media area), respectively. The diameters of aorta and renal function were unchanged by cilostazol. Interestingly, cilostazol decreased miR-221, but enhanced miR-143 and miR-145 in either in vitro or aortic tissue, as well as attenuated several pro-inflammatory mediators, including asymmetrical dimethylarginine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, vascular endothelial growth factor in aorta and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). We demonstrated a proof of concept of the effectiveness of cilostazol in attenuating IH in a Chr I/R mouse model, a CKD model with predominantly indirect-vascular-injury-induced IH. These considerations warrant further investigation to develop a new primary prevention strategy for CKD-related IH. © 2017 Chancharoenthana et al.

2-s2.0-85034059715,"Aims: In order to add to the existing knowledge about structural diversity of biosurfactants, marine environment was chosen to discover a new type of biosurfactant-producing fungus. Methods and Results: A number of fungi were collected from the Gulf of Thailand and examined for biosurfactant productivities. A dimorphic fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans YTP6-14, produced several different biosurfactants in both heavy oil and aqueous layers of the culture. Surface tension of the aqueous layer was decreased to 31·4 mN m−1 and oil displacement area reached 53 cm2/10 μl after 7 days of cultivation. Critical micelle concentration and minimum surface tension values of the crude biosurfactants prepared from the aqueous layer were 39 mg l−1 and 31·6 mN m−1 respectively. Surface tension values remained unchanged over a wide range of pH and NaCl concentrations, suggesting their nonionic feature. LC/MS and NMR analyses revealed that one of the main active compounds in the aqueous layer was 5-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid delta-lactone, known as massoia lactone. Massoia lactone indeed showed significant surface tension reduction capacity of 43·3 mN m−1 at 1 mg ml−1. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first report for the production of a fragrant biosurfactant, massoia lactone by a fungus A. pullulans. Massoia lactone has been industrially prepared from aromatic bark of an endangered tree species, Cryptocarya massoy, growing in rainforests. This report expands the diversity of biosurfactants produced by A. pullulans and also points to its possibility in contributing to the green sustainable chemistry, and ultimately rainforest conservation. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology"
2-s2.0-85034068717,"A novel multiclass macroscopic model is proposed in this article. In order to enhance first-in, first-out property (FIFO) and transmission function in the multiclass traffic modeling, a new multiclass cell transmission model with FIFO property (herein called FM-CTM) is extended from its prior multiclass cell transmission model (M-CTM). Also, to enhance its analytical compactness and resultant computational convenience, FM-CTM is formulated in this paper as a set of closed-form matrix equations. The objective is to improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation by enforcing FIFO property when a fast vehicle cannot overtake a slow vehicle due to a limitation of a single-lane road. Moreover, the proposed model takes into account a different priority for vehicles of each class to move forward through congested road conditions, and that makes the flow calculation independent from their free-flow speeds. Some hypothetical and real-world freeway networks with a constant or varying number of lanes are selected to verify FM-CTM by comparing with M-CTM and the conventional CTM. Observed densities of VISSIM and real-world dataset of I-80 are selected to compare with the simulated densities from the three CTMs. The numerical results show that FM-CTM outperforms the other two models by 15% of accuracy measures in most cases. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to be well applicable to the road network with a mixed traffic and varying number of lanes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The main purpose of this study was to develop a novel nanomedicine-based antifertility compound for non-surgical castration of male animals. Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L) pericarp extract has been shown to exhibit anti-fertility property. α-mangostin (AM)-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (AM-NLC) was developed to improve male germ cell apoptosis. This study was conducted to investigate physicochemical properties of AM-NLC and determine the biological effects of AM-NLC on spermatogonia cells and testicular explants obtained from castrated testes. AM-NLC was produced through a hot homogenization technique. The negatively charged particle of AM-NLC was nano-sized with a narrow dispersity. AM-NLC exhibited antiproliferative activity towards spermatogonium cells. It induced apoptosis in the cells. In addition, AM-NLC exhibited anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Abnormal anatomy of seminiferous tubule was noted following treatment of testicular explant with AM-NLC. This nanomedicine-based sterilant would be a promising platform that may have utility in non-surgical castration of male animals by intra-testicular injection. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85033572607,"Excess tert-butyl alcohol is generally used to promote the etherification reaction for production of glycerol ether. However, the difficulty in recovering this excess alcohol is caused by the presence of an azeotropic mixture of tert-butyl alcohol and water, a by-product from the etherification. This work proposes a recovery process of tert-butyl alcohol consisting of extractive distillation and conventional distillation columns. Feasible organic and ionic liquid solvents are firstly screened through such criteria as environmental concern and thermodynamic insight. Then, simulations of the extractive and distillation system for tert-butyl alcohol recovery are performed based on the suitable selected solvents, i.e., 3-octanone, hexyl acetate and 2-heptanone. From the techno-economic assessment, hexyl acetate is the most suitable solvent and the optimal configuration and operation of the process are also presented. Regarding the environmental impact indicator, hexyl acetate is also considered the most suitable solvent due to the lowest requirement of solvent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Oxides derived from highly abundant and low cost calcium-rich natural materials, including dolomite, seashell, chicken eggshells and cuttlebone, by simple calcination were investigated as solid base catalysts for the transesterification of methyl decanoate with solketal under solvent free conditions. Among the catalysts studied, the calcium and magnesium mixed oxides derived from dolomite gave the highest yield (84%) of solketal fatty esters at 150 °C within 6 h and their superior catalytic activity was correlated with their higher basicity. The catalyst could be regenerated by calcination at 800 °C and successfully reused for up to five cycles with <20% drop in the catalytic activity. The formation of calcium fatty ester hydrates, as soap-like compounds, during the catalytic reaction caused a loss of active calcium species. Under the optimized conditions, transesterification of various fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with solketal was characterized and revealed that long-chain FAMEs were preferential reactants. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers"

The study area is located in the northern part of the Indochina Block, based on the basic geotectonic subdivision of mainland Southeast Asia. The fauna consists of 17 taxa and includes age-diagnostic Pilammina densa, Pilamminella grandis, Citaella dinarica, C.? deformata, Arenovidalina amylovoluta, and Diplotremina astrofimbriata. It is referable to the middle Anisian (Pelsonian) of the Middle Triassic. The microfacies of the studied samples are subdivided into three types, suggesting low wave-energy uppermost subtidal, moderately wave-agitated uppermost subtidal, and intertidal environments, respectively. Two species are specific to the intertidal microfacies. A notable paleontological feature is the dominance of P. densa, shown by the large number of individuals in the foraminiferal assemblage. This could be related to its opportunistic nature in the stressful conditions of the intertidal environment. We also consider that C.? deformata may be ecologically adapted to a hypersaline environment. The Sam Neua fauna shares several important species, such as C. dinarica, P. densa, P. grandis, and A. amylovoluta, with those found in the Sibumasu Block, Sukhothai Zone, and South China Block, suggesting that these major geotectonic domains in mainland Southeast Asia formed a single paleobiogeographic province during Anisian time.

The data sample consists of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Selection criteria based on the number of leptons and the invariant mass of oppositely charged lepton pairs are used to distinguish the signal from the standard model background. The observations are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. The results are used to place limits on the production of heavy fermions of the type-III seesaw model as a function of the branching ratio to each lepton flavor. In the scenario of equal branching fractions to each lepton flavor, heavy fermions with masses below 840 GeV are excluded.

2-s2.0-85032829181,"In the past decade, many researchers have published papers about hybridization between long-tailed and rhesus macaques. These previous works have proposed unidirectional gene flow with the Isthmus of Kra as the zoogeographical barrier of hybridization. However, these reports analyzed specimens of unknown origin and/or did not include specimens from Thailand, the center of the proposed area of hybridization. Collected specimens of long-tailed and rhesus macaques representing all suspected hybridization areas were examined. Blood samples from four populations each of long-tailed and rhesus macaques inhabiting Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos were collected and analyzed with conspecific references from China (for rhesus macaques) and multiple countries from Sundaic regions (for long-tailed macaques). Ninety-six single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers specifically designed to interrogate admixture and ancestry were used in genotyping. We found genetic admixture maximized at the hybrid zone (15–20°N), as well as admixture signals of varying strength in both directions outside of the hybrid zone. These findings show that the Isthmus of Kra is not a barrier to gene flow from rhesus to long-tailed populations. However, to precisely identify a southernmost barrier, if in fact a boundary rather than simple isolation by distance exists, the samples from peninsular Malaysia must be included in the analysis. Additionally, a long-tailed to rhesus gene flow boundary was found between northern Thailand and Myanmar. Our results suggest that selection of long-tailed and rhesus macaques, the two most commonly used non-human primates for biomedical research, should take into account not only the species identification but also the origin of and genetic admixture within and between the species. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Quadrilateral polygons were drawn from means of variables for each cluster, as prototypes of profilograms, to find subgroups by factor analysis, to find relationship of selected variables, and to find significant differences of airway volumes among clusters. Methods A total of 301 adults, 18 to 56 years (160 men and 141 women) were selected retrospectively. Two-Step-Cluster (TSC) analysis was applied to find clusters of variables and categorized as M1, M2, F1, and F2. Factor analysis was performed to have subgroups of 26 variables. Prototypes of profilograms were superimposed to explore relationship of selected variables. Significant differences in airway volumes were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance. Results The frontal profilograms revealed asymmetry. The lateral profilograms of M2 cluster revealed a downward and backward growth pattern, whereas M1 revealed forward growth pattern. All clusters revealed nasal width to be half that of palatal width, and one-third of the mandibular width. The palate distance was two-thirds of the mandibular width and length. The posterior vertical height was half of the anterior. Conclusions Orthodontic evaluation could be approached by mapping any profilogram to our prototypes. M1 had skeletal Class 3 deep bite.

This study investigated the role of miRNA in human mesangial cells (HMCs) stimulated with auto anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies. HMCs were treated with antibodies purified from active LN patients or non-specific IgG controls in the presence of normal serum. Aberrant miRNA was screened using high throughput sequencing. Anti-dsDNA IgG up-regulated 103 miRNAs and down-regulated 30 miRNAs. The miRNAs regulated genes in the cell cycle, catabolic processes, regulation of transcription and apoptosis signalling. miR-10a was highly abundant in HMCs but was specifically downregulated upon anti-dsDNA IgG induction. Interestingly, the expression of miR-10a in kidney biopsies from class III and IV LN patients (n = 26) was downregulated compared with cadaveric donor kidneys (n = 6). Functional studies highlighted the downstream regulator of miR-10a in the chemokine signalling and cell proliferation or apoptosis pathways. Luciferase assay confirmed for the first time that IL8 was a direct target of miR-10a in HMCs.

Thirty specimens were dissected from 16 human embalmed cadavers (12 men and four women; mean age: 80.5 years). The vertical distance between the eSLN and the apical pole of the thyroid gland (AP) was 8.2 ± 4.2 mm. It descended over the AP with <1 cm distance in 51.7%, >1 cm distance in 27.6% and under the AP in 20.7%.

Mansonone G (MG), a naphthoquinone-containing compound extracted from the heartwood of Mansonia gagei, exhibits various biological activities including antitumor potential. In the present study, MG and its semi-synthetic derivatives were selected to study the preferential binding site and dynamics behavior as well as to predict the inhibitory activity against TopoIIα using molecular modeling approaches. The molecular docking results revealed that the entire series of MG preferentially target to the ATPase domain. Among all studied MGs, the ester derivative MG14 containing C-10 length exhibited the highest binding affinity against TopoIIα and greater than that of the ATP-competitive inhibitor salvicine as well as 1,4-benzoquinone. Interestingly, the MG14 binding could induce the closed form of the turn region (residues 147–151) inside ATP-binding pocket, implying that this event might be one of the crucial mechanisms underlying TopoIIα inhibition.

Occupational exposure (mSv) was measured in 42 IC staff, using 2 OSLD badges place at inside lead apron and at collar. Annual eye lens doses (mSv) were also measured using 4 nanoDots OSL placed outside and inside lead glass eyewear. The prevalence of radiation-associated posterior lens opacities was 28.6% (2/7) for IC, 19.5% (8/41) for nurses, and 2.7% (1/37) for controls. The average and range of annual whole body effective dose, Hp(10), equivalent dose at skin of the neck, Hp(0.07) and equivalent dose at eye lens, Hp(3) were 0.80 (0.05–6.79), 5.88 (0.14–35.28), and 5.73 (0.14–33.20) mSv respectively. The annual average and range of eye lens dose using nano Dots OSL showed the outside lead glass eyewear on left and right sides as 8.06 (0.17–32.45), 3.55(0.06–8.04) mSv and inside left and right sides as 3.91(0.05–14.26) and 2.44(0.06–6.24) mSv respectively. Conclusion Eye lens doses measured by OSLD badges and nano Dot dosimeter as Hp(10), Hp(0.07) and Hp(3). The eyes of the IC personnel were examined annually by two ophthalmologists for the prevalence of cataract induced by radiation. © 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica"
2-s2.0-85032472545,"Microbes form fundamental bases of every Earth ecosystem. As their key survival strategies, some microbes adapt to broad ranges of environments, while others specialize to certain habitats. While ecological roles and properties of such ""generalists"" and ""specialists"" had been examined in individual ecosystems, general principles that govern their distribution patterns and evolutionary processes have not been characterized. Here, we thoroughly identified microbial generalists and specialists across 61 environments via meta-analysis of community sequencing data sets and reconstructed their evolutionary histories across diverse microbial groups. This revealed that generalist lineages possess 19-fold higher speciation rates and significant persistence advantage over specialists. Yet, we also detected three-fold more frequent generalist-to-specialist transformations than the reverse transformations. These results support a model of microbial evolution in which generalists play key roles in introducing new species and maintaining taxonomic diversity. © 2017 The Author(s)."

ForenSeq™ DNA Signature Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc.) has been designed exclusively for forensic DNA analysis that autosomal STRs, X-STR, Y-STR and identity SNPs can be sequenced simultaneously. These informative genetic data empower the achievement of global DNA database presenting in autosomal STRs and Y-STR. The Y-STRs comprised of 8 core loci, 2 multi-copy loci and other 14 Y-STR loci. Here, we examined 24 Y-STR of 182 Thai male population that originate from Central, Western and Southern regions of Thailand. In this study, the average gene diversity (GD) of this kit is 0.7031. The lowest gene diversity was 0.4187 from DYS391 locus and DYS385a-b showed the highest gene diversity (0.9582). One hundred and seventy-two haplotypes were observed and therefore, these 24 Y-STR markers would be beneficial for forensic investigation, paternity test and genealogy study in Thai population. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

As they contribute to diverse biological process and respond to various kinds of cellular stress, their utility as diagnostic biomarkers have recently been explored. miRNAs have been detected in various type of human tissues and were used as novel biomarkers in clinical investigation for example; ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and several forms of cancer cells. Recently, circulatory miRNA was proved that It could be a potential biomarker to determine a cause of death. In order to verify the ability of miRNA as a diagnosis tool, 3 candidate miRNAs (miR-133a, miR-208b and miR-499) associated to an early response of cardiac injury were selected. Twenty case-control cohorts using post-mortem blood samples were studied for miRNAs expression and post-mortem stability.

2-s2.0-85030563516,"Viewed in renal physiology as a refined filtration device, the glomerulus filters large volumes of blood plasma while keeping proteins within blood circulation. Effects of macromolecule size and macromolecule hydrodynamic interaction with the nanostructure of the cellular layers of the glomerular capillary wall on the glomerular size selectivity are investigated through a mathematical simulation based on an ultrastructural model. The epithelial slit, a planar arrangement of fibers connecting the epithelial podocytes, is represented as a row of parallel cylinders with nonuniform spacing between adjacent fibers. The mean and standard deviation of gap half-width between its fibers are based on values recently reported from electron microscopy. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is represented as a fibrous medium containing fibers of two different sizes: the size of type IV collagens and that of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The endothelial cell layer is modeled as a layer full of fenestrae that are much larger than solute size and filled with GAGs. The calculated total sieving coefficient agrees well with the sieving coefficients of ficolls obtained from in vivo urinalysis in humans, whereas the computed glomerular hydraulic permeability also falls within the range estimated from human glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our result indicates that the endothelial cell layer and GBM significantly contribute to solute and fluid restriction of the glomerular barrier, whereas, based on the structure of the epithelial slit obtained from electron microscopy, the contribution of the epithelial slit could be smaller than previously believed. © 2017 by ASME."
2-s2.0-85030718693,"ALFPm6, a member of antimicrobial peptide in the antilipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) family from Penaeus monodon, plays important roles in shrimp immunity against pathogens. However, its antimicrobial activity and underlying mechanism have not been reported. The synthetic cyclic ALFPm6#29-52 peptide (cALFPm6#29-52) corresponding to the ALFPm6 LPS-binding domain can agglutinate and exhibited bacterial killing activity toward a Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli 363 and Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus megaterium, Aerococcus viridans, and Micrococcus luteus, with MIC values of 25-50 μM. Specifically, ALFPm6 and ALFPm3, the most abundant ALF isoforms, are different in terms of gene expression patterns upon pathogen infections. Herein, the regulation of ALFPm3 and ALFPm6 gene expression was studied. The 5′-upstream and promoter sequences were identified and the putative transcription factor (TF)-binding sites were predicted. The narrow down assay indicated that the ALFPm3 promoter and partial promoter of the ALFPm6 active regions were located at nucleotide positions (-814/+302) and (-282/+85), respectively. Mutagenesis of selected TF-binding sites revealed that Rel/NF-κB (-280/-270) of ALFPm3 and C/EBPβ (-88/-78) and Sp1 (-249/-238) sites of ALFPm6 were the activator-binding sites. Knockdown of the PmMyD88 and PmRelish genes in V. harveyi-infected shrimp suggested that the ALFPm3 gene was regulated by Toll and IMD pathways, while the ALFPm6 gene was regulated by the Toll pathway. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85029208129,"The proposed work aims at designing a classification system for automatic identification of A. muelleri species, grown as a potential cash crop in many Asian countries, from the DNA fingerprints of Amorphophallus genus. Four sets of 48 DNA fingerprints belonging to 37 species of the Amorphophallus genus, developed with the help of four different primers are considered for the experiment, with an objective to identify only the fingerprints of the species of interest. A second experimental setup deals with the automatic classification of species containing high amounts of glucomannan from the same set of DNA fingerprints of the Amorphophallus genus. For each set of 48 DNA fingerprints generated with a specific primer, the DNA fingerprints are preprocessed to extract a 42 dimensional feature vector which is used to generate a k-Nearest Neighbor based classifier based on the Leave One Out Cross Validation protocol. Final classification based on outputs from individual classifiers constructed with respect to the four different primers is performed according to a n-star consensus strategy. The n-star consensus predicts species A. muelleri with cent per cent accuracy while it predicts species containing glucomannan with a more modest accuracy of 81.25%. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85029569713,"Modern biometric identification methods combine interdisciplinary approaches to enhance person identification and classification accuracy. One popular technique for this purpose is Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The signal so obtained from BCI will be further processed by the Autoregressive (AR) Model for feature extraction. Many researches in the area find that for more accurate results, the signal must be cleaned before extracting any useful feature information. This study proposes Independent Component Analysis (ICA), k-NN classifier, and AR as the combined techniques for electroencephalogram (EEG) biometrics to achieve the highest personal identification and classification accuracy. However, there is a classification gap between using the combined ICA with the AR model and AR model alone. Therefore, this study takes one step further by modifying the feature extraction of AR and comparing the outcome with the proposed approaches in lieu of prior researches. The experiment based on four relevant locations shows that the combined ICA and AR can achieve higher accuracy than the modified AR. More combinations of channels and subjects are required in future research to explore the significance of channel effects and to enhance the identification accuracy."
2-s2.0-85029765631,"Background Influenza continues to have a substantial socioeconomic and health impact despite a long established vaccination programme and approved antivirals. Preclinical data suggest that combining antivirals might be more effective than administering oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial of a combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin versus oseltamivir monotherapy with matching placebo for the treatment of influenza in 50 sites, consisting of academic medical centre clinics, emergency rooms, and private physician offices in the USA, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia. Participants who were aged at least 18 years with influenza and were at increased risk of complications were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online computer-generated randomisation system to receive either oseltamivir (75 mg), amantadine (100 mg), and ribavirin (600 mg) combination therapy or oseltamivir monotherapy twice daily for 5 days, given orally, and participants were followed up for 28 days. Blinded treatment kits were used to achieve masking of patients and staff. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with virus detectable by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab at day 3, and was assessed in participants who were randomised, had influenza infection confirmed by the central laboratory on a baseline nasopharyngeal sample, and had received at least one dose of study drug. Safety assessment was done in all patients in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227967. Findings Between March 1, 2011, and April 29, 2016, 633 participants were randomly assigned to receive combination antiviral therapy (n=316) or monotherapy (n=317). Seven participants were excluded from analysis: three were not properly randomised, three withdrew from the study, and one was lost to follow-up. The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the pilot phase, 172 without confirmed influenza, and 13 without an endpoint sample. 80 (40·0%) of 200 participants in the combination group had detectable virus at day 3 compared with 97 (50·0%) of 194 (mean difference 10·0, 95% CI 0·2–19·8, p=0·046) in the monotherapy group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related disorders, primarily nausea (65 [12%] of 556 reported adverse events in the combination group vs 63 [11%] of 585 reported adverse events in the monotherapy group), diarrhoea (56 [10%] of 556 vs 64 [11%] of 585), and vomiting (39 [7%] of 556 vs 23 [4%] of 585). There was no benefit in multiple clinical secondary endpoints, such as median duration of symptoms (4·5 days in the combination group vs 4·0 days in the monotherapy group; p=0·21). One death occurred in the study in an elderly participant in the monotherapy group who died of cardiovascular failure 13 days after randomisation, judged by the site investigator as not related to study intervention. Interpretation Although combination treatment showed a significant decrease in viral shedding at day 3 relative to monotherapy, this difference was not associated with improved clinical benefit. More work is needed to understand why there was no clinical benefit when a difference in virological outcome was identified.

Vitamin D (VD) supplementation has been shown to reverse these processes in vitro and in vivo. This study sought to determine the effect of VD supplementation on serum fibrotic markers in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Fifty-four CHC patients with VD deficiency were randomized into two groups, a VD group (n = 29) and a placebo group (n = 29). The serum levels of 25-hydroxy VD, TGF-β1, TIMP-1, MMP2 and MMP9 were measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-week study period. Upon correction of VD levels, TGF-β1 and TIMP-1 levels were decreased, and the MMP2 and MMP9 levels were significantly increased in the VD group. A comparison of the mean changes (delta) in the markers between groups showed that TGF-β1 and TIMP-1 levels were significantly decreased and the MMP2 and MMP9 were significantly higher in the VD group than in the placebo group. By using CHC patients as a model, this study provides additional evidence that VD plays an important role in the reversal of hepatic fibrogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s)."

In a flask culture, this isolate fermented both glucose and sucrose to lactate with high yield (0.96 and 0.87 g/g) and productivity (2.8 and 2.6 g/L h), respectively. The higher lactate production performance was obtained in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of liquefied starch (150.1 g/L final titer, 0.98 g/g yield, 3.2 g/L h productivity) and the fed-batch glucose fermentation (139.9 g/L final titer, 0.96 g/g yield, 2.9 g/L h productivity). Significant increase in lactate productivity (5.5–6.1 g/L h) was obtained from the high/heavy-inoculum seed in the stirred tank fermentor. Both calcium bases and monovalent bases were successfully employed for pH control during lactate fermentation by this isolate resulting in a versatile and simple operation. By the two-phase fermentation using the high/heavy-inoculum seed of BC-001, the fermentation reproducibility was acquired toward the pilot-scale fermentors. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
2-s2.0-85027694743,"Illegal trade in chemicals and waste has brought severe negative impacts to human health and the environment. Fragmentation of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) has challenged implementation due to disconnects and inconsistencies between regimes that causes inefficiencies, overlapping norms, and duplication. Since the late 1990s, there have been proposals to cluster MEAs organizationally and functionally to create synergies between them. This paper evaluates whether the proposition on clustering of MEAs has worked in practice through an empirical case study of the “MEA Regional Enforcement Network (REN)”. MEA REN sought to cluster at the organizational and functional elements of the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Stockholm Convention, and the Montreal Protocol in South and Southeast Asia. Regarding organizational clustering, through co-organizing regional network meetings cross-MEA learning was enhanced and costs were saved, but co-locating regional offices proved more challenging. For the clustering of functional elements, MEA enforcement was ultimately strengthened through several joint initiatives across MEAs. However, not all functions could be clustered as anticipated, including data reporting due to incompatibility between the conventions and overall workloads. The paper concludes with recommendations for future environmental enforcement. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2-s2.0-85028911471,"Aberrant metabolism in hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) has been observed in several cancers, affecting cellular signaling and tumor progression. However, the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification through HBP flux, in apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we found that hyper-O-GlcNAcylation in lung carcinoma cells by O-GlcNAcase inhibition renders the cells to apoptosis resistance to cisplatin (CDDP). Profiling of various key regulatory proteins revealed an implication of either p53 or c-Myc in the apoptosis regulation by O-GlcNAcylation, independent of p53 status. Using co-immunoprecipitation and correlation analyses, we found that O-GlcNAcylation of p53 under certain cellular contexts, i.e. high p53 activation, promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, resulting in a gain of oncogenic and anti-apoptotic functions. By contrast, O-GlcNAcylation of c-Myc inhibits its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Gene manipulation studies revealed that O-GlcNAcylation of p53/c-Myc is in part a regulator of CDDP-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, we classified CDDP resistance by hyper-O-GlcNAcylation in lung carcinoma cells as either p53 or c-Myc dependence based on their molecular targets. Together, our findings provide novel mechanisms for the regulation of lung cancer cell apoptosis that could be important in understanding clinical drug resistance and suggest O-GlcNAcylation as a potential target for cancer therapy. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85028746772,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has a critical role in diverse cellular events including inflammation, apoptosis and necroptosis through different signaling complexes. However, little is known about how the transition from inflammatory signaling to the engagement of death pathways is modulated. Here we report that the cytoplasmic retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) controls receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)-initiated cell death when cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) activity is blocked. Through screening a short hairpin RNA library, we found that RARγ was essential for TNF-induced RIP1-initiated apoptosis and necroptosis. Our data suggests that RARγ initiates the formation of death signaling complexes by mediating RIP1 dissociation from TNF receptor 1. We demonstrate that RARγ is released from the nucleus to orchestrate the formation of the cytosolic death complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that RARγ has a similar role in TNF-induced necroptosis in vivo. Thus, our study suggests that nuclear receptor RARγ provides a key checkpoint for the transition from life to death. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85027170300,"Structures and high-pressure phase transitions in ZnO0.5S0.5 and ZnO0.5Se0.5 have been investigated using density functional theory calculations.

Stabilities of these materials have been systematically studied up to 40 GPa using various approaches. We have confirmed the stability of the chalcopyrite structure up to 30 GPa for which the CuAu-I structure has been previously proposed. However, our calculation revealed that CuAu-I is not a stable structure under 32 GPa and 33 GPa for both ZnO0.5S0.5 and ZnO0.5Se0.5, respectively, which could explain the failure in several attempts to fabricate these materials under such conditions. We have also examined the pressure-dependence of the bandgap and electronic structure up to 30 GPa. We can conclude from our PDOS analysis that the applied pressure does not change the atomic state characters of electronic states near the top of valence and the bottom of conduction bands, but mainly modifies the dominant Zn-3d atomic state of the deep Bloch state at −1 eV below Fermi level. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society."
2-s2.0-85028639282,"Notch signaling regulates diverse biological processes in dental pulp tissue. The present study investigated the response of human dental pulp cells (hDPs) to the indirect immobilized Notch ligand Jagged1 in vitro. The indirect immobilized Jagged1 effectively activated Notch signaling in hDPs as confirmed by the upregulation of HES1 and HEY1 expression. Differential gene expression profiling using an RNA sequencing technique revealed that the indirect immobilized Jagged1 upregulated genes were mainly involved in extracellular matrix organization, disease, and signal transduction. Downregulated genes predominantly participated in the cell cycle, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Indirect immobilized Jagged1 significantly reduced cell proliferation, colony forming unit ability, and the number of cells in S phase. Jagged1 treated hDPs exhibited significantly higher ALP enzymatic activity, osteogenic marker gene expression, and mineralization compared with control. Pretreatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor attenuated the Jagged1-induced ALP activity and mineral deposition. NOTCH2 shRNA reduced the Jagged1-induced osteogenic marker gene expression, ALP enzymatic activity, and mineral deposition. In conclusion, indirect immobilized Jagged1 suppresses cell cycle progression and induces the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of hDPs via the canonical Notch signaling pathway. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85028617867,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO2 NP) discharged into water bodies can affect ecosystems and human health adversely. We studied the properties of residual TiO2 NPs with and without gentle mixing (to simulate a natural environment more closely) and after settling for 12-h periods. Surface complexation, dynamic particle size changes, and TiO2 NP destabilization in synthetic and lake waters were investigated. The accumulation of inert ions (Na+ and Cl-) in the diffuse layer which was not discussed in other studies was supposed to be the main reason that aggregation occurred slowly and continuously. PO4 3- stabilized and destabilized TiO2 NPs at 10 mM and 100 mM, respectively. Destabilization occurred because high ionic strength overwhelmed increased negative charges of TiO2 NPs by complexation with PO4 3-. TiO2 NP destabilization was achieved in approximately 12 h in synthetic and lake waters, and is attributed to the slow diffusion of ions into aggregates. Despite the presence of moderately high concentrations of natural organic matter, which tends to stabilize TiO2 NPs, the addition of 20 mM PO4 3- destabilized the TiO2 NPs in lake water. Smaller aggregate sizes formed compared with those before destabilization, which indicates that stable residual TiO2 NPs could exist in aquatic environments after extended periods. © 2017 The Author(s)."

Here, catalytic oligomerization of olefins-rich bio-syngas (simulated gas) to gasoline-range hydrocarbons was investigated over Ni/ASA catalysts. Wet impregnation method was adopted to prepare Ni/ASA catalysts with Ni contents varying from 1 to 7 wt%. The prepared Ni/ASA were tested by BET, XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD and Py-IR to characterize their texture structures, chemical state and acidity properties. Results indicated that 1 wt% Ni/ASA catalyst exhibited the highest performance in the oligomerization of olefins-rich bio-syngas with ethylene, propylene and butylene conversion of 8.4 C-mol%, 32.6 and 71.5 C-mol%, respectively. And STY of gasoline-range hydrocarbons reached 74.2 g/(kgcata·h) after 12 h time on stream. The chemical state of the nickel on catalyst surface was varied along with different NiSO4 concentration loading. Furthermore, the acidity of catalysts, predominantly Lewis type, was also enhanced with the loading of NiSO4. Compared with parent ASA, the loading of NiSO4 on ASA promoted the olefins conversion and the formation of gasoline-range products with a great degree of isomerization (> 90%). The hydrogen transfer reaction of olefins also be promoted with the increasing of the NiSO4 loading. This unique behavior of Ni/ASA catalysts could be ascribed to their texture and acid sites/nickel cations ratio. A possible reaction pathway supported by the experimental results was addressed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85026242667,"Clip domain serine proteinases (ClipSPs) play an important role in the prophenoloxidase-activating (proPO) system. In the shrimp Penaeus monodon, the ClipSP PmClipSP2 has been previously shown to bind to microbial polysaccharides (LPS and β-1,3-glucan) and likely activates the proPO system. To reveal the binding site of the PmClipSP2 protein, the N-terminal clip domain (Clip-PmClipSP) and C-terminal SP domain (SP-PmClipSP2) were separately cloned. The recombinant proteins were then assayed for their binding properties and involvement in proPO activation. According to the ELISA-based binding assay, rSP-PmClipSP2, but not rClip-PmClipSP, can bind immobilized LPS and β-1,3-glucan as well as significantly activate PO activity. The binding site at the SP domain is proposed to have a pattern sequence (X-[PFY]-X-[AFILV]-[AFY]-[AITV]-X-[ILV]-X(5)-W-[IL]-X) that is located at the C-terminal region of the SP domain of PmClipSP2. Deletion of the pattern sequence abolished binding to LPS and β-1,3-glucan. Conversely, a recombinant protein containing the pattern sequence (rPT-PmClipSP2-TRX) had the ability to bind to cell wall components, confirming that the pattern sequence at the C-terminus of PmClipSP2 is responsible for binding to microbes, subsequently leading to activation of the proPO cascade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Using the central composite design (CCD) approach, we optimized the method for analysis parameters including the electrode surface loadings of GO and AuNPs as well as the working solution pH. The method exhibited a wide linear range of 1–250 µM for analyte detection using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) on AuNPs/GO-SPCE under the optimized conditions. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.22 and 0.72 µM, respectively. In addition, we also report the application of the method for carbofuran determination in real cucumber and rice samples. This sensitive and selective carbofuran detection method is very promising for simple and low cost analysis in real agricultural fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85027152700,"Infection of mice with strains of Plasmodium yoelii parasites can result in different pathology, but molecular mechanisms to explain this variation are unclear. Here we show that a P. yoelii gene encoding a HECT-like E3 ubiquitin ligase (Pyheul) influences parasitemia and host mortality. We genetically cross two lethal parasites with distinct disease phenotypes, and identify 43 genetically diverse progeny by typing with microsatellites and 9230 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A genome-wide quantitative trait loci scan links parasite growth and host mortality to two major loci on chromosomes 1 and 7 with LOD (logarithm of the odds) scores = 6.1 and 8.1, respectively. Allelic exchange of partial sequences of Pyheul in the chromosome 7 locus and modification of the gene expression alter parasite growth and host mortality. This study identifies a gene that may have a function in parasite growth, virulence, and host-parasite interaction, and therefore could be a target for drug or vaccine development. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85025594633,"Background: This study investigated the attitudes of orthodontists and laypersons towards the choice of extracting second premolars, rather than first premolars, based on tooth condition and the use of additional anchorage devices. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to two groups: 324 orthodontists who were members of the Thai Association of Orthodontists, and 100 randomly selected Thai laypersons aged above 20 years and who were unrelated to the field of dentistry. Descriptive and chi-square statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 142 orthodontists (43.8%) and completed by 100 laypersons. The larger the size of the caries lesion in the maxillary second premolar was found, the more orthodontists and laypersons both chose to extract a carious maxillary second premolar instead of a healthy maxillary first premolar. For orthodontists, the use of mini-implant anchorage was significantly related to their extraction decision. Orthodontists who were familiar with mini-implants usage would choose to extract the second premolar at a lower size of extent of caries. Besides, when larger sizes of caries lesions in maxillary second premolars were considered, laypersons tended to have greater acceptance of the use of additional anchorage devices in order to keep the healthy maxillary first premolar. Conclusions: In this study, tooth condition and the use of anchorage devices are currently the main considerations by both orthodontists and laypersons when selecting the teeth to be extracted for orthodontic treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Materials and methods: Retrospective review of MR abdomino-pelvis or pelvis in children from Oct 2014–Dec 2016 was done. Only exams with 3D T2 FSE sequence performed on a single scanner type were selected. Patients with history of post appendectomy, studies in which field of view did not include ileocecal valve, with technical and protocol errors, or with fat-saturated acquisition were excluded. All images were blindly reviewed by three radiologists. The following questions were asked: (1) Is the appendix visualized?, (2) What is the most clearly demonstrable plane?, (3) Where is the appendix located?, (4) Are there any findings indicating appendicitis? Average pairwise percentage and Fleiss Kappa were used to assess the inter-rater agreement on the visualization and location of the appendix. Results: A total of 22 MRI studies were reviewed (F = 13:M = 9, Mean age = 11.45 yrs. [SD = 4.3]). Total MRI scan time was estimated at 6 mins. Readers saw appendix in 72.7–81.8%, and saw with high confidence in 12 cases (54.5%), low confidence in 4–6 case (18.2–27.3%), and did not see in 4–6 cases(18.2–27.3%). The average pairwise percentage agreement was 71.2%. Fleiss Kappa of overall rating of visualization was 0.52 (p < 0.001). Fleiss Kappa of high confidence of visualization was 0.76 (p < 0.001). Reader 1 and reader 2 saw the appendix best on the axial plane. Reader 3 saw the appendix best on the coronal plane. For location, deep pelvis was the most common identified location. The average pairwise percentage agreement was 68.2% and Fleiss Kappa was 0.76 (p < 0.001). There is no findings indicating appendicitis. Conclusion: A single 3D T2 FSE sequence had good ability to detect normal appendices and also allowed multiplanar reconstructions, which may use as a single-sequence protocol in cases of suspected appendicitis in children when ultrasound is inconclusive. © 2017, American Society of Emergency Radiology."
2-s2.0-85024501714,"A distance-based paper analytical device (dPAD) for loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection based on distance measurement was proposed. This approach relied on visual detection by the length of colour developed on the dPAD with reference to semi-quantitative determination of the initial amount of genomic DNA. In this communication, E. coli DNA was chosen as a template DNA for LAMP reaction. In accordance with the principle, the dPAD was immobilized by polyethylenimine (PEI), which is a strong cationic polymer, in the hydrophilic channel of the paper device. Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), a colourimetric indicator for monitoring the change of magnesium ion concentration in the LAMP reaction, was used to react with the immobilized PEI. The positive charges of PEI react with the negative charges of free HNB in the LAMP reaction, producing a blue colour deposit on the paper device. Consequently, the apparently visual distance appeared within 5 min and length of distance correlated to the amount of DNA in the sample. The distance-based PAD for the visual detection of the LAMP reaction could quantify the initial concentration of genomic DNA as low as 4.14 × 103 copies µL−1. This distance-based visual semi-quantitative platform is suitable for choice of LAMP detection method, particular in resource-limited settings because of the advantages of low cost, simple fabrication and operation, disposability and portable detection of the dPAD device. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85024099797,"Objectives To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables. Methods We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls. Results Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered –SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics. Conclusions Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85022066491,"Bleached rice bran wax (BRX), which is a by-product of rice bran oil purification, was used in this study. Bleached rice bran wax organogels (BRXO) were produced by mixing rice bran oil with BRX at 3%, 5%, 7% and 9 wt%. The crystal morphology and polymorphisms of BRXO were similar to bulk wax. BRXO crystal morphology is needle-like and fibrous. Crystalline BRXO has a structure with an orthorhombic sub-cell. The DSC thermographs showed two melting and crystallization profiles. BRXO formed gels at 5, 7 and 9 wt%. The gelation time decreased with an increase in BRX levels. The oil-binding capacity of BRXO at 7 and 9% BRX levels was higher than that at 98%. Texture parameters (firmness, hardness and adhesiveness), thermal behaviours (melting and crystallization behaviour) and SFC varied significantly with BRX level. The water-in-oil emulsion was prepared by using 9% BRXO (EO9). EO9 showed good stability compared to emulsion without the addition of organogels (E). Margarine in cookies was replaced with EO9. The hardness and colour of cookie dough and cookies were significantly affected by level of replacement, while the diameter, width, and spread factor were not significantly different. The results showed that BRX has feasibility for producing the organogels and water-in-oil emulsions, which have potential for margarine replacement in cookies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85026426421,"A viral responsive protein 15 from Penaeus monodon (PmVRP15) has been reported to be important for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection in vivo. This work aims to characterize PmVRP15 and investigate its possible role in nuclear import/export of the virus. Circular dichroism spectra showed that PmVRP15 contains high helical contents (82%). Analytical ultracentrifugation suggested that PmVRP15 could possibly form oligomers in solution. A subcellular fractionation study showed that PmVRP15 was found in heavy and light membrane fractions, indicating that PmVRP15 may be associated with endoplasmic reticulum. Double-stranded RNAi-mediated knockdown of PmVRP15 gene expression in vitro showed no effect on WSSV copy number in whole hemocyte cells. However, PmVRP15 silencing resulted in an accumulation of WSSV DNA in the nucleus of PmVRP15-silenced hemocytes. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that PmVRP15 knockdown hemocytes had a much lower level of VP28 (WSSV envelope protein), in comparison to that in the control. It is likely that PmVRP15 may play a role in viral nuclear egress. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85022326064,"The cross-sectional study described the epidemiology of 8560 canine urolith submissions from Thailand to the Minnesota Urolith Center between January 2009 and December 2015. The frequency of urolith types, the relationships between urolith type and breed, sex, and neutered status, and change of annual submission proportion over the study period were analyzed. Struvite was the most common canine urolith (44%), and was commonly found in intact females with a mean age of 6.3 ± 3.1 years. Calcium oxalate was the second most common (27%), more frequently found in intact males with a mean age of 8.8 ± 3.3 years. Compound, purine, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silica urolith were less common. During the study period, the proportion of struvite urolith significantly decreased from 48% in 2009 to 39% in 2015 (p < 0.001). The proportion of CaOx increased from 21% in 2009 to 32% in 2015 (p < 0.001).

2-s2.0-85021632147,"Automatic in silico synthesis of metabolic pathway can practically reduce the cost of wet laboratories. To achieve this, predicting whether or not two metabolites are transformable is the first essential step. The problems of predicting the possibility of transforming one metabolite into another and how to computationally synthesize a metabolic pathway were studied. These two problems were transformed to the problem of classifying features of metabolite pairs into transformable or non-transformable classes. The following two main issues were contributed in this study: (1) two new feature schemes, i.e. the projected features on their first principal component and the average features, for representing transform-ability of each metabolite pair using 2D and 3D compound structural features and (2) a method of modified imbalanced data handling by adding synthetic boundary data of different classes to balance data. Based on the E. coli reference pathways, the results of proposed features with feature selection and our imbalanced data handling approach show the better performance than the results from other methods when evaluated by several metrics. Our significant feature group possibly achieves high classification correctness of computational pathway synthesis. In pathway recovery results by a group of neural network models, 19 pathways were significantly recovered by our feature group at each recovery ratio of at least 0.5, whereas the other compared feature group gave only four significantly recovered pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85020708887,"Chitosan biopolymer is proposed as an alternative EPR dosimeter. Its ability to be EPR dosimeter was studied in comparison with the conventional alanine, sugars (i.e., glucose and sucrose), formate derivatives (i.e., lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) formate). Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and paraffin were used as binder for the preparation of composite EPR dosimeter. Dose responses of all materials were investigated in a wide dose range of radiation doses, i.e., low-level (0–1 kGy), medium-level (1–10 kGy) and high-level (10–100 kGy). The EPR dosimeter properties were studied under different parameters, i.e., microwave power, materials contents, absorbed doses, storage conditions and post-irradiation effects. Li-formate showed a simple EPR spectrum and exhibited superior radiation response for low-dose range; whereas chitosan and sucrose exhibited linear dose response in all studied dose ranges. The EPR signals of chitosan exhibited similar stability as glucose, Li-formate and alanine at ambient temperature after irradiation as long as a year. All EPR signals of the studied materials were affected post-irradiation temperature and humidity after gamma irradiation. The EPR signal of chitosan exhibited long-term stability and it was not sensitive to high storage temperatures and humidity values after irradiation. Chitosan has a good merit as the alternative bio-based material for a stable EPR dosimeter in a wide range of radiation-absorbed doses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019771197,"Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a zinc-finger transcription factor encoded by Zbtb7a, is a protooncogene that regulates differentiation in diverse cell lineages, and in the CNS, its function is relatively unexplored. This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreERT:Zbtb7afl/fl mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen-induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6-week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreERT:Zbtb7afl/fl mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone. LRF knockdown from either the Plp/CreERT line or the NG2CreERT line did not significantly change OP or oligodendrocyte populations. In vitro promoter assays demonstrated the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin-related genes and the notch target Hes5, which has been implicated in control of myelin formation and repair. In summary, in the oligodendrocyte lineage, LRF is expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes but is not required for oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions. Furthermore, LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination, potentially by contributing to interactions regulating transcription. Published [2017].

2-s2.0-85023768965,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer epithelium, making it a promising target for molecular imaging and therapy. Recently, several studies found unexpected PSMA radiotracer uptake by thyroid tumors, including radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) cancers. PSMA expression was reported in tumor-associated endothelium of various malignancies, however it has not been systematically addressed in thyroid tumors. We found that PSMA was frequently expressed in microvessels of thyroid tumors (120/267), but not in benign thyroid tissue. PSMA expression in neovasculature was highly irregular ranging from 19% in benign tumors to over 50% in thyroid cancer. Such heterogeneity was not directly attributed to endothelial cell proliferation as confirmed by immunostaining with proliferation-associated endothelial marker CD105. PSMA expression was associated with tumor size (p = 0.02) and vascular invasion in follicular carcinoma (p = 0.03), but not with other baseline histological, and clinical parameters. Significant translational implication is that RAIR tumors and high-grade cancers maintain high level of PSMA expression, and can be targeted by PSMA ligand radiopharmaceuticals. Our study predicts several pitfalls potentially associated with PSMA imaging of the thyroid, such as low expression in oncocytic tumors, absence of organ specificity, and PSMA-positivity in dendritic cells of chronic thyroiditis, which is described for the first time. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85020398553,"This study examines the simulated temperature over Southeast Asia (SEA) using the Regional Climate Model version 4.3 (RegCM4.3), and its sensitivity to selected cumulus and ocean surface flux schemes. Model simulations were conducted for the SEA domain at 36 km spatial resolution for the period of 1989–2008, as part of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling/Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-Southeast Asia (SEACLID/CORDEX-Southeast Asia) project. A total of 18 sensitivity experiments were conducted with a combination of six cumulus parameterization schemes and three ocean surface flux schemes. The model's skill in representing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures is evaluated against observed gridded data sets. Results indicate a predominant cold bias in all simulations, particularly over mainland SEA (Indochina) during the season of December to February. Nevertheless, the seasonal correlation is highest over this region. The cold bias of the model is also evident in the temperature distributions, such that there are more cold months than observed, which may be associated with the underestimation of the daily maximum temperature. A few simulations also reveal a warm bias over some areas in the Maritime Continent. Further examination shows that both radiative and surface fluxes influence the simulated temperature, which may also have effects that partially offset each other in some areas. Comparison of the sensitivity experiments reveals differences in model performance, and underlines the importance in choosing the appropriate configuration for RegCM4.3 before it is used to downscale climate projections, particularly for the SEA region. This study also shows a strong influence of the choice of cumulus scheme on temperature. Based on performance metrics for temperature among the schemes tested, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Emanuel cumulus scheme and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme version 1e (BATS1e) ocean surface flux scheme can be used in future simulations for the region. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society"

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has been reported in Europe, America, and Asia including Thailand. The disease causes substantial losses to the swine industry in many countries. Presently, there is no effective PEDV vaccine available. In this study, we developed a plant-produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C10 as a prophylactic candidate to prevent the PEDV infection. Recently, plant expression systems have gained interest as an alternative for the production of antibodies because of many advantages, such as low production cost, lack of human and animal pathogen, large scalability, etc. The 2C10 mAb was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and lettuce using geminiviral vector. After purification by protein A affinity chromatography, the antibody was tested for the binding and neutralizing activity against PEDV. Our result showed that the plant produced 2C10 mAb can bind to the virus and also inhibit PEDV infection in vitro. These results show excellent potential for a plant-expressed 2C10 as a PEDV prophylaxis and a diagnostic for PEDV infection."

2-s2.0-85015838467,"Background: Age is a factor affecting smile esthetics. Three variables of smile esthetics associated with the maxillary anterior teeth and age-related changes have recently received considerable attention: (i) the incisal edge position of the maxillary central incisors, (ii) the maxillary gingival display, and (iii) the presence of a black triangle between the maxillary central incisors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of age on smile esthetic perception based on these three variables in a group of Thai laypeople. Methods: The smiles were constructed from a photograph of a female smile. Smile photographs were altered in various increments using three variables: the incisal edge position of the maxillary incisors, gingival display, and a black triangle between the maxillary central incisors. The photographs were shown to a group of 240 Thai laypeople. The subjects were divided into two groups: a younger group, 15–29 years old (n = 120) and an older group, 36–52 years old (n = 120). Each subject was asked to score the attractiveness of each smile separately using a visual analog scale. Results: Smile attractiveness scores concerning the incisal edge positions of the maxillary central incisors were similar between the two groups. However, upper lip coverage was rated as unattractive by the younger group. A gingival display of 0 and 2 mm was rated as most attractive by the younger group. Upper lip coverage and gingival display of 0 and 2 mm were considered attractive by the older group. Excessive gingival display (6 mm) was scored as unattractive by both groups. A black triangle ranging from 1 to 2.5 mm between the maxillary central incisors was scored differently between the two groups. The older group was more tolerant of the black triangle size. Conclusions: Age impacts smile perception based on maxillary gingival display and the presence of a black triangle between the maxillary central incisors, but not of the incisal edge position of the maxillary central incisors. Due to the variation in esthetic perception of each individual, participation between orthodontists and patients for decision-making and treatment planning is a crucial process to provide successful results. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85018891443,"The most common technology for postcombustion of CO2 capture is the amine solvent scrubber. The energy consumption for capturing CO2 from flue gases using amine solvent technology is 15–30% of the power plant electricity production. Hence, there is a need to develop more efficient methods of removing CO2. A circulating fluidized bed using sodium or potassium carbonates is potentially such a process, as their high decomposition pressures allow regeneration at low temperatures using waste heat rather than steam from the power plant. But equilibrium data for the sorbents require the use of several cooled stages to achieve high CO2 conversions. Here, a method of computing such a number of stages for a given CO2 conversion was developed using multiphase computational fluid dynamics.

The positive cases were only from dead specimens (21/168, 12.5% dead samples) of two non-native captive species, poison dart frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) and tomato frog (Dyscophus antongilii) in one zoo. Immunohistochemistry and histopathology revealed the typical feature of fl ask-shaped zoosporangia and septate thalli, supporting the PCR-based evidence of chytridiomycosis in captive amphibians in Thailand, but detected Bd in only 7/21 of the PCR-positive samples. Although the introduction of a pathogenic strain of Bd from imported carriers might have a serious impact on the native amphibian populations in Thailand, chytridiomycosis has not currently been detected in native Thai amphibians. An active surveillance system is needed for close monitoring of the fungus crossing into Thai amphibian populations."
2-s2.0-85014742131,"Research on the diffusion of management accounting innovations (MAIs) has grown into a substantial literature which draws attention to how diffusion processes can be fuelled by compulsory regulation. However, relatively little is known about how MAIs interact with wider regulatory processes in society and how this affects the adaptation of such innovations as they diffuse across organisations. This paper extends research on this topic by addressing the questions of how regulators mediate the adaptation of MAIs and how this mediation affects the use of such innovations across regulatees. We explore these questions in relation to the evolution of Economic Value Added (EVA™) as a compulsory performance management system for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Thailand. Theoretically, we extend research on management innovations with sociological research, which sees regulation as an evolving and collaborative process that unfolds as an integral part of broader, societal reform programmes. Consistent with this perspective, we show how regulators can fill a key role as mediators by engaging in ongoing consultations with the suppliers of MAIs as well as regulatees, and how this imbues the regulatory standards that govern the use of such innovations with considerable flexibility. We also extend this perspective on regulation by showing how the regulatory standards governing EVA™ were influenced by multiple, and partly competing, reform programmes centred on other innovations. In addition, we show how the mediating role of regulators enables regulatees to influence the evolution of regulatory standards and how this facilitates compliance with regulation and allows regulatees to adapt MAIs to industry-specific regulations and cultural characteristics. We discuss the implications of these findings for the sociological literature on regulation informing this paper and for research on the diffusion of MAIs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85016940905,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) exhibits lymphotropic, epitheliotropic, and neurotropic nature, and causes a severe systemic infection in susceptible animals. Initially, signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) expressed on immune cells has been identified as a crucial cellular receptor for CDV. Currently, nectin-4 expressed in epithelia has been shown to be another receptor for CDV. Our previous study demonstrated that neurons express nectin-4 and are infected with CDV. In this study, we investigated the distribution pattern of nectin-4 in various cell types in the canine central nervous system and showed its relation to CDV infection to further clarify the pathology of disease. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses were done using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of CDV-infected dogs. Dual staining of nectin-4 and CDV antigen or nectin-4 and brain cell markers was performed. Nectin-4 was detected in ependymal cells, epithelia of choroid plexus, meningeal cells, neurons, granular cells, and Purkinje's cells. CDV antigens were detected in these nectin-4-positive cells, further suggesting contribution of nectin-4 for the CDV neurovirulence. On the other hand, astrocytes did not express nectin-4, although they were frequently infected with CDV. Since astrocytes are negative for SLAM expression, they must express an unidentified CDV receptor, which also contributes to CDV neurovirulence. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85012901711,"One of stretchable electronic devices is known as the compliant electrode which can retain good electrical conductivity under deformation. Compliant electrodes from MWCNTs and DPNR were prepared by using a UV-curing process and Triton X-100 as a dispersing agent. The effect of Triton X-100/MWCNTs volume ratio was investigated by transmission electron microscopy indicating the highest dispersion was obtained at the volume ratio of 15.6. The mechanical and electrical properties were investigated by a melt rheometer in a tension mode. The 3%v/v MWCNTs composite possessed an excellent mechanical behavior (Young's modulus = 1.27 × 106 Pa) and a high electrical conductivity (1.03 S/cm) relative to previous works. Under the same experimental conditions, a commercial compliant electrode named Danfoss exhibited the Young's modulus and electrical conducivity values of 7.56 × 106 Pa and 2.54 × 10−2 S/cm, respectively, which were inferior to the 3%v/v MWCNTs/DPNR. Moreover, the composite film still retained good electrical behaviors under 100% strain, high extentional strain rate of 1 s−1, high flexed angle, and repeated stretching cycles (40% strain, 50 times) due to the intimate compatibility between the MWCNTs and the elastomer matrix.

2-s2.0-84953775863,"This work sought to improve the toughness and thermal stability of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) by incorporating poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and wood flour (WF). The PLA/PBS blends showed a PBS-dose-dependent increase in the impact strength, elongation at break, degree of crystallinity, and thermal stability compared to the PLA, but the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and flexural strength were all decreased with increasing PBS content. Based on the optimum impact strength and elongation at break, the 70/30 (w/w) PLA/PBS blend was selected for preparing composites with five loadings of WF (5–30 phr). The impact strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, and thermal stability of the PLA/PBS/WF composites decreased with increasing WF content, and the degree of crystallinity was slightly increased compared to the 70/30 (w/w) PLA/PBS blend. Based on differential scanning calorimetry, the inclusion of PBS and WF into PLA did not significantly change the glass transition and melting temperatures of PLA in the PLA/PBS blends and PLA/PBS/WF composites. From the observed cold crystallization temperature of PLA in the samples, it was evident that the degree of crystallinity of PLA in all the blends and composites was higher than that of PLA. The PLA/PBS blend and PLA/PBS/WF composite degraded faster than PLA during three months in natural soil, which was due to the fast degradation rate of PBS. POLYM.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of using Vetiveria zizanioides, Bambusa bambos and Pennisetum purpureum to remove arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn) from the metal (loid) tailings pond of a gold mine. The aerial or aboveground parts (shoots and leaves) and underground parts (roots) of these plants, as well as the metal (loid) tailings soil, were analyzed for the As and Mn contents using the USEPA technique. The samples were collected every 30 d over a 180 d cultivation period. This study has shown that the relative growth rate (RGR) of all three plants’ dry weight decreased with increasing cultivation time to 180 d. The results exhibited that P. purpureum had the highest growth rate and accumulated the highest As and Mn levels in the aerial parts at 15.5 and 943.3 mg/plant, respectively. On the other hand, the accumulation of As and Mn in the underground parts were 1.8 and 93.7 mg/plant, respectively. Moreover, P. purpureum is very tolerant to various soil and weather conditions; and it provides abundant biomass. Hence, rather than using it as phytoremediation only, P. purpureum could be utilized as biomass feedstock for producing heat and electricity. © 2017, Soil Science Society of Pakistan."

The objective of the study was to determine the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and advanced puberty. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with precocious puberty (breast onset <8 years, n=42) and early puberty (breast onset 8-9 years, n=17), compared to age-matched controls (n=77). Anthropometric measurements, estradiol, basal and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, uterine sizes, ovarian diameters and bone ages (BA) were obtained. Urine samples were collected and mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) and mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and adjusted with urine creatinine. The median adjusted-MEP concentration in girls with precocious puberty, was greater than in normal girls (6105.09 vs. 4633.98 μg/g Cr: p<0.05), and had the same trend among early puberty and normal puberty (5141.41 vs. 4633.98 μg/g Cr: p=0.4), but was not statistically significant.

2-s2.0-85036544496,"We apply the G-theory and anomaly of ghost and antighost fields in the theory of supersymmetry to study a superspace over time series data for the detection of hidden general supply and demand equilibrium in the financial market. We provide proof of the existence of a general equilibrium point over 14 extradimensions of the new G-theory compared with the M-theory of the 11 dimensions model of Edward Witten. We found that the process of coupling between nonequilibrium and equilibrium spinor fields of expectation ghost fields in the superspace of time series data induces an infinitely long exact sequence of cohomology from a short exact sequence of moduli state space model. If we assume that the financial market is separated into two topological spaces of supply and demand as the D-brane and anti-D-brane model, then we can use a cohomology group to compute the stability of the market as a stable point of the general equilibrium of the interaction between D-branes of the market. We obtain the result that the general equilibrium will exist if and only if the 14th Batalin-Vilkovisky cohomology group with the negative dimensions underlying 14 major hidden factors influencing the market is zero. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017."
2-s2.0-85053773163,"Cut-surface color is one of the most important appearance factors for customer purchase decisions. Browning on the cut surface, which involves action of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), occurs when fresh-cut fruit is prepared and continues during storage in the presence of oxygen. Uneven browning on the flesh and core of apple may result from uneven distribution of phenolics and PPO. The aims of this study were to determine PPO activity and the amount of phenolics in 'Granny Smith' apple core and flesh and to measure browning discoloration in both crude enzyme extract and the cut apple surface. The effects of inhibitors (sodium chloride, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and their mixtures) on enzymatic browning retardation using endogenous and exogenous substrates were also investigated. The results showed an uneven distribution of PPO, phenolic and flavonoid content in apple. Higher enzyme specific activity was found in the core, while larger amounts of phenolics were found in flesh. Color change and browning index (BI), over 3.5 h, on the cut surface of apple treated with inhibitors were lower than those of the control (no treatment). Apple core had higher BI compared with flesh. Exogenous substrate was more specific towards PPO compared with endogenous substrate. The Trichromatic Color Analyzer (TCA) system was used to monitor color appearance, including lightness, chroma and hue, during continuing brown discoloration on the cut apple surface. Results at the time of the first measurement and after 610 min showed that mixed inhibitors could reduce in chroma shift more than lightness and hue shifts. TCA confirmed that greater uneven color distribution increased with time. © 2017 International Society for Horticultural Science.All Rights Reserved."

Coffee samples from different processes and locations were clearly differentiated by the electronic tongue. Differences between the processes (civet cat (free-range), civet cat (caged) and normal wet-processing) were perceivably significant (>78% clearly detecting differences) between coffees from the same location (Doi Tung). However, when the location factor was introduced (Doi Chang vs. Doi Tung), the differences were reduced, and only civet coffee from different locations and different feeding methods (free-range vs. caged) was significantly different.

2-s2.0-85037705620,"Aroma characteristics and antioxidant activity are main quality markers for a good cup of coffee. These attributes are influenced by the degree of ripeness of the coffee berries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to study the differences between ripe and unripe green coffee beans in volatile compounds and antioxidant activities to evaluate the selection process of coffee berries. Two types of green coffee beans processed from ripe and unripe coffee berries from the same plantation were characterized for their volatile components by solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) using 2-methyl-3-heptanone as an internal standard. More than 200 peaks of volatile constituents were found in both unripe and ripe green coffee. Alcohols and ketones were the most abundant groups of volatile compounds in unripe green coffee, while the concentrations of these two groups decreased during the ripening process. In contrast, aldehydes, acids, and esters increased. Various compounds were found only in ripe green coffee, such as 1-hexanol, 2-heptanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2,2-dimethyl-3-4-pentadienal, methyl hexanoate, methyl phenylacetate, methyl salicylate, methyl-(2E)-2-methyl-2butenoate, and 2,7-dimethyl-oxepine. In terms of antioxidant activity measurements, total phenolic content of ripe and unripe green coffee beans was 59.94±4.14 and 54.56±0.73 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) g-1 coffee beans; diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (%) was 71.74±5.26 and 70.68±4.78, and reducing antioxidant power by ferric-reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay was 66.98±4.70 and 52.72±3.20 mg Trolox g-1 coffee beans, respectively.

2-s2.0-85037691271,"This research aimed to prolong the shelf-life of cultivated banana (Musa acuminata subsp. siamea) by using a chitosan coating containing a photocatalyst. Banana fruits at matured green stage were separated into three subgroups: (i) uncoated, (ii) coated with chitosan (CS), and (iii) coated with chitosan containing photocatalyst (CS+Ti). All samples were stored at room temperature (28±2°C). Changes in qualities of bananas including pH, color as determined by hue angle, total soluble solids (TSS), firmness, and sensory evaluation (including color, odor and firmness) were examined consecutively throughout the storage. Changes in pH, color, TSS, and firmness of uncoated banana were significantly faster (p>0.05) than those of CS and CS+Ti, respectively. The bananas coated with CS+Ti had a slower ripening process than those coated with CS and the control. The CS+Ti coating outperformed CS coating, and was proven to be able to maintain qualities and extend shelf-life of banana. These results were possibly due to the good oxygen-barrier property of chitosan and the ability to decompose ethylene of the photocatalyst incorporated into the chitosan coating, thus delaying the ripening process of the fruit."
2-s2.0-85029581975,"Galvanized coatings are widely used in industry, but the influences of microstructure on corrosion behaviors have rarely been studied in these coatings. The present investigation aims to systematically analyze crystallographic texture and nanostructural features of galvanized coatings as well as their chromate conversion layers, and examines the relationship between their structures and corrosion properties. Three groups of electrogalvanized coatings fabricated with different types of plating additives are studied, using a series of complementary characterization techniques. The corrosion behaviors of the deposits are then analyzed with the potentiodynamic polarization technique and salt spray test, in light of their structural characteristics. The study reveals that the additives critically influence the microstructure of both the galvanized coatings and chromate layer. The corrosion resistance of the coatings can be enhanced by suppressing the {100} crystallographic planes of zinc and minimizing defects along the zinc/substrate interface, and by promoting formation of an amorphous-oxide layer in the chromate film. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85037688660,"The dried calyx of the roselle flower (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), which is commonly used for consumption as juice, has a high content of anthocyanins, natural compounds known for their antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, anthocyanins are unstable and susceptible to degradation, particularly during heating and storage. This research thus aimed to investigate the influence of pectin and rebaudioside A additions and storage temperature on anthocyanin stability and antioxidant activity of roselle juice. Roselle juice was prepared from dried calyx and extracted with water (1:10) at 50°C for 30 min. Four sets of sample solutions containing pectin, rebaudioside A and preservative were analyzed during storage: roselle juice (J), roselle juice with 1% pectin (PJ), roselle juice with 0.03% rebaudioside A (RJ), and roselle juice with 1% pectin and 0.03% rebaudioside A (PRJ). All samples were heated at 63°C for 30 min, and stored in amber glass at cold (4°C) or ambient (30°C) temperature for 10 weeks. Anthocyanin content, antioxidant capacity, and total polyphenol content were measured weekly. Samples J, PJ, RJ and PRJ exhibited anthocyanin content of 728.32±33.08, 681.10±9.16, 734.17±37.00 and 660.79±10.45 mg L-1, respectively. After storage for 10 weeks, all samples showed significantly high rates of degradation when kept at ambient temperature, compared with the 4°C storage (p≤0.05). Half-life (t1/2) times of anthocyanins of sample PRJ increased by 9.82% (at ambient temperature) and by 26.09% (at 4°C). From this research, additions of pectin 1% and rebaudioside A 0.03% help to stabilize anthocyanins of roselle juice. Moreover, the juice should be kept at 4°C to maintain the stability of anthocyanins in roselle juice for optimum health benefits."
2-s2.0-85037691507,"Coffee is one of the highest value economic crops in the world market. During the last decade, coffee drinking throughout Thailand has increased significantly. This phenomenon attracts farmers to grow more coffee, especially in the northern highlands of Thailand, e.g. Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Lampang provinces. However, the height above sea level and plantation environment could affect the quality of coffee beans. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties of green coffee beans from Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Lampang provinces, as well as a proximate analysis. Seven coffee plantations were selected for study in this research. Antioxidant properties of green coffee bean were assessed by using DPPH radical scavenging, FRAP assay and total phenolic content, while proximate analysis followed the AOAC method. The results showed that the higher the plantation above sea level, the more antioxidant activity was exhibited by green coffee beans, especially at 1200 m; beans grown at this altitude were significantly higher in antioxidant activity those from other, lower areas. For different methods of processing, it was found that wet-processed green coffee bean had more antioxidant activity than beans subjected to other processes. In terms of proximate analysis, green coffee bean from Chiang Rai and Lampang provinces showed significantly higher fat content than those from Chiang Mai province. Chiang Rai green coffee beans were found to have lower contents of crude protein, but were significantly higher in dietary fiber than beans from other areas (p≤0.05).

Scientists have predicted an impending reduction in yield of these crops and, therefore, have been searching for alternative agricultural produce in an attempt to avoid a food crisis. Being a fast-growing plant bearing fruit with high starch content, banana is potentially the next starch-based staple. The objectives of this study were therefore to investigate the properties of pastes and gels of wheat flour/banana flour mixtures and to evaluate the effect of banana flour substitution on the quality of soft pretzel. Banana flours were prepared from two cultivars of Musa ABB group, ‘Kluai Namwa’ (KN) and ‘Kluai Hakmook’ (KH). The wheat flour-to-banana flour ratio was set to 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30 by weight. It was found that the pasting temperature of banana flours was significantly lower, while the peak, breakdown, final and setback viscosities were significantly higher than those of wheat flour (p≤0.05). Freshly prepared KN flour- and KH flour-substituted gels demonstrated greater breaking force compared with wheat flour gel. However, addition of KN or KH flour was shown to help retard gel hardening during 10 days of storage at 4°C. Soft pretzel exhibited increased hardness and gumminess upon banana flour replacement. In terms of baking quality, banana flour-containing pretzels possessed lower specific volume than the control. Addition of banana flour was shown to affect hue angle of the crumb, while no effect was demonstrated for the crust. Chroma of both crust and crumb decreased with banana flour substitution. Crumb of banana flour-containing samples was lower in terms of whiteness index than the control.

Objective: To analyse the relationships between serum leptin, vitamin D status, muscle strength and physical performance in OA patients. Methods: A total of 208 knee OA patients were enrolled. Serum leptin, vitamin D, muscle strength and physical performance were evaluated. Results: OA patients with sarcopenic obesity had significantly higher serum leptin levels than those with non-sarcopenic obesity. In addition, knee OA patients with sarcopenic obesity displayed low grip strength and poor physical performance. Furthermore, high serum leptin was negatively associated with vitamin D and physical performance. Conclusions: Serum leptin levels were correlated with low vitamin D, reduced muscle strength and functional impairment, suggesting that serum leptin might serve as a biomarker reflecting physical performance in OA patients. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Most other works on this subject deal with relatively low ‘conventional’ pressures (0.1–0.5 Pa). However, the present work describes pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering deposition of titanium dioxide thin films at process pressures in the range 2–5 Pa in a purpose-built sputtering rig. The influence of the other deposition conditions, such as pulse frequency and duty cycle, is also discussed. Additionally, a series of N-doped titania coatings was produced by using air as the reactive gas. The morphological and compositional properties of the coatings were studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Wettability of the films was studied through measurement of water contact angles under UV light irradiation. Photocatalytic properties of the samples were assessed through the degradation of two model pollutants, methylene blue and stearic acid, under UV light irradiation. The results showed that elevated process pressures (4 Pa and above) allow the direct deposition of anatase titania films, without additional heat treatment, while amorphous titania tends to form at lower process pressures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

As reactive sites, pentafluorophenyl ester (PFP) groups were incorporated in the copolymer to allow for a multiple post-polymerization modification. UV-cross-linkable moieties were first introduced by partially reacting PFP groups in the copolymer with ortho-nitrobenzyl (ONB)-protected diamine. Electrospinning the resulting ONB-containing P(PFPA-co-NIPAM), followed by UV-induced cross-linking, yielded stable cross-linked thermoresponsive PNIPAM-based fiber mats. The remaining PFP active groups on the surface of copolymer fiber mats allowed for further conjugation with an H-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-OH (GRGDS) peptide, a well-known cell adhesive peptide sequence that was selected as a model in order to promote cell growth. At 37 °C, fibroblast cells were found to attach, spread, and proliferate well on the GRGDS-immobilized cross-linked (CL) fiber mat, as opposed to those on the GRGDS-immobilized un-cross-linked (UCL) fiber mat. By decreasing the temperature down to 20 °C, i.e. below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of thermoresponsive PNIPAM, cultured cells could easily be released from both GRGDS-immobilized CL and UCL fiber mats, whereas no cells were detached from tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). These results suggest that the thermosensitive and active functional fiber mat obtained in this research represent an attractive and versatile platform for cultured cell recovery, which is beneficial for tissue engineering applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85030756076,"Gypsum-bonded investment, which is commonly used in gold casting, can cause several defects such as gas porosity from the decomposition of gypsum. Thus, the insight study in the behavior of gypsum-bonded investment can lead to resolve the problem in casting process. It consists of SiO2 (α-cristobalite and α-quartz) as a refractory and gypsum as a binder. During burn out process, the dehydration of gypsum, the inversion of cristobalite and quartz and the III–II CaSO4 transition were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) coupled with thermogravimetry analyzer (TGA) and in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD). Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) layer on the gold product surface after casting was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is believed to be attributed to the reaction between CO2 from residues of carbonized wax and CaO from the decomposition of CaSO4. This observation is may be responsible for high roughness and low quality in the gold casting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85042318316,"A search for new physics in energetic, high-multiplicity final states has been performed using proton–proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3fb−1. The standard model background, dominated by multijet production, is determined exclusively from control regions in data. No statistically significant excess of events is observed. Model-independent limits on the product of the cross section and the acceptance of a new physics signal in these final states are set and further interpreted in terms of limits on the production of black holes. Semiclassical black holes and string balls with masses as high as 9.5TeV, and quantum black holes with masses as high as 9.0TeV are excluded by this search in the context of models with extra dimensions, thus significantly extending limits set at a center-of-mass energy of 8TeV with the LHC Run 1 data. © 2017 The Author(s)"
2-s2.0-85038864869,"A statistical combination of searches is presented for massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, and ZH boson pairs in proton–proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data were taken at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 19.7 and up to 2.7 fb−1. The results are interpreted in the context of heavy vector triplet and singlet models that mimic properties of composite-Higgs models predicting W′ and Z′ bosons decaying to WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons. A model with a bulk graviton that decays into WW and ZZ is also considered. This is the first combined search for WW, WZ, WH, and ZH resonances and yields lower limits on masses at 95% confidence level for W′ and Z′ singlets at 2.3 TeV, and for a triplet at 2.4 TeV. The limits on the production cross section of a narrow bulk graviton resonance with the curvature scale of the warped extra dimension k˜=0.5, in the mass range of 0.6 to 4.0 TeV, are the most stringent published to date. © 2017 The Author(s)"
2-s2.0-85033452553,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is proposed to be a key mechanism responsible for metastasis-related deaths. Similarly, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed to be a key driver of tumor metastasis. However, the link between the two events and their control mechanisms is unclear. We used a three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid assay and other CSCindicating assays to investigate the role of E-cadherin in CSC regulation and its association to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression and knockdown of E-cadherin were found to promote and retard, respectively, the formation of tumor spheroids in vitro but had opposite effects on tumor formation and metastasis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. We explored the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results and demonstrated, for the first time, that E-cadherin is required as a component of a major survival pathway under detachment conditions. Downregulation of E-cadherin increased the stemness of lung cancer cells but had an adverse effect on their survival, particularly on non-CSCs. Such downregulation also promoted anoikis resistance and invasiveness of lung cancer cells. These results suggest that anoikis assay could be used as an alternative method for in vitro assessment of CSCs that involves dysregulated adhesion proteins. Our data also suggest that agents that restore E-cadherin expression may be used as therapeutic agents for metastatic cancers. © 2017 the American Physiological Society."
2-s2.0-85035068574,"A measurement of vector boson scattering and constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings from events with two Z bosons and two jets are presented. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton–proton collisions at s=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The search is performed in the fully leptonic final state ZZ→ℓℓℓ′ℓ′, where ℓ,ℓ′=e or μ. The electroweak production of two Z bosons in association with two jets is measured with an observed (expected) significance of 2.7 (1.6) standard deviations. A fiducial cross section for the electroweak production is measured to be σEW(pp→ZZjj→ℓℓℓ′ℓ′jj)=0.40−0.16 +0.21(stat)−0.09 +0.13(syst) fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings are determined in terms of the effective field theory operators T0, T1, T2, T8, and T9.

2-s2.0-85033717251,"A recent meeting of health ministers from over 40 countries worldwide deemed that time and money should be spent on outcome and experience measures that would allow us to determine whether our health systems deliver outcomes that truly matter to patients. This meeting, along with recent national programmes to promote the use of outcome measures in evaluating medical and surgical interventions, highlighted the important role that patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient reported experience measures (PREMs) have in healthcare. Oral medicine as a speciality has promoted the use of PROMs to some extent in the recent past with the use of generic and oral health specific measures in the literature and the delivery of plenary lectures at international scientific meetings. We could find no publications regarding the use of PREMs in oral medicine. This article highlights the commonly used PROM tools in the oral mucosal disease and salivary gland literature and makes recommendations for the evaluation of the development properties of currently used instruments and the establishment of core outcome sets in the commonly managed conditions in an oral medicine setting. It is also hoped that by looking at the types of PREM tools available we can determine a suitable instrument for the evaluation of patient experience in oral medicine practice."

A separate feed technique, with the ethylene (C2H4) feed position fraction of 0.5, was used to reduce all the undesirable reactions and to maximize the ethylene oxide (EO) production (selectivity and yield). The N2O system with a N2O/C2H4 feed molar ratio of 0.17:1 exhibited the highest ethylene epoxidation performance (80.1% EO selectivity and 21.9% EO yield) with a very low carbon monoxide selectivity and the lowest power consumption, as compared to pure O2 and air as oxidant systems at their respective optimal feed molar ratios of 0.2:1 and 0.1:1, respectively. Interestingly, the EO yield from the DBD system with N2O was about 2-fold higher than that of the O2 and air system. © 2017 American Chemical Society."

J.P.’s medical history included left-middle cerebral artery (left-MCA) stroke, high frequency hearing loss, macular degeneration, and a recent hospitalization related to a fall. Results from his neuropsychological testing and from information gathered during the clinical interview with his wife suggested that a deficit in executive functioning might have been the source for some of his perceived memory problems. We were unable to detect any progressive cognitive decline that might have been suggestive of something more sinister. Despite his age J.P. was a fully functioning and highly contributing member of his society who was completing quite complex activities of daily living (ADLs). We provided J.P. with a compensatory set of strategies in order for him to circumvent his executive difficulties and impairment in expressive language.

2-s2.0-85037350381,"Abstract: TiO 2 supported Au–Pd and Cu–Pd catalysts were prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of Pd followed by electroless deposition (ED) of a second metal with incremental surface coverages of Au or Cu. High dispersion of small Pd particles on the Pd/TiO 2 prepared by SEA led to the high amount of second metal deposition on Pd surface. The Cu addition by ED increased the relative ratio of linear CO adsorption mode indicating the presence of higher amount of isolated Pd atoms. The ensemble effect of the Cu–Pd/TiO2 catalysts resulted in the improved catalytic performances in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene. However, as revealed by the blue shift of CO-IR and XPS results, Au addition by ED rather exhibited the electronic modification. The highest catalytic activity was obtained on the 1.10% Au–Pd/TiO2 catalyst; however, the Cu addition (0.12% Cu–Pd/TiO2, θ Cu= 0.37) showed interesting results as only a small amount of Cu was used to improve the catalyst performances. The bimetallic catalysts were also prepared by conventional impregnation for comparison purposes. These catalysts exhibited several drawbacks such as low Pd dispersion, formation of second metal aggregates, and blockage of isolated Pd atoms. Graphical Abstract: SynopsisTiO 2 supported Au-Pd and Cu-Pd catalysts were prepared by using the combination of strong electrostatic adsorption for Pd and electroless deposition for second metal addition. The catalytic performances for selective hydrogenation of acetylene were improved due to the ensemble and electronic modifications of the Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Au–Pd/TiO2, respectively.

2-s2.0-85036559805,"Background Nocturnal hypokinesia is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), negatively affecting quality of life of both patients and caregivers. However, evidence-based treatment strategies are limited. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of rotigotine transdermal patch, using a wearable sensor, in the management of nocturnal immobility. Methods 34 PD subjects with nocturnal immobility were randomized to receive rotigotine transdermal patch (mean ± SD of 10.46 ± 4.63 mg/24 h, n = 17) or placebo patch (n = 17). Treatment was titrated to an optimal dose over 1–8 weeks, then maintained for 4 weeks. Primary endpoints were objective parameters assessing axial rotation measured using an axial inertial sensor (the NIGHT-Recorder) over two nights at the patients’ home. Scale-based assessments were also performed. Results There was a significant difference, in favor of rotigotine, in change from baseline score in the number of turns in bed (ANCOVA, p = 0.001), and degree of axial turn (p = 0.042). These objective improvements were mirrored by significantly greater improvements in clinical scale-based assessments, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total scores (p = 0.009), UPDRS-motor scores (p < 0.001), UPDRS-axial scores (p = 0.01), the Modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (p < 0.001), the Nocturnal Akinesia Dystonia and Cramp Scale (p = 0.003) and the eight-item PD Questionnaire (PDQ-8) scores (p = 0.01) from baseline to end of treatment in patients given rotigotine compared to placebo. Conclusion We show that the rotigotine patch provides a significant improvement in nocturnal symptoms as assessed using both objective measures and clinical rating scales.

Three head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (HSC-3, HN-8, and HN-30) were treated with a range of concentrations of either resveratrol or oxyresveratrol. MTT assays demonstrated that resveratrol and oxyresveratrol significantly inhibited cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. Although ELISA and Real-time PCR revealed that oxyresveratrol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression at both the mRNA and protein level, the reduction was lower than that of resveratrol. Altogether, these findings indicate that oxyresveratrol possesses anticancer properties by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and VEGF expression.

The aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence of AI in patients with NTD α-thalassemia, and to identify factors that predict the development of AI in this thalassemia subpopulation. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in NTD α-thalassemic children at three referral hospitals in Thailand in 2015–2016. Preliminary screening for AI was done using the 1 μg adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Suspected AI was then confirmed on insulin tolerance test (ITT). AI was defined as peak cortisol <18 μg/dL. AI was categorized as either primary or secondary AI according to peak ACTH. Results: Thirty patients with NTD α-thalassemia were included in this study. Ten of 25 patients (40%) had abnormal initial screening. Eight of nine (88.9%) who underwent ITT were confirmed as having AI. No patients diagnosed with AI had any clinical symptoms of AI. The percentage of primary and secondary AI (n = 8) was 25% and 75%, respectively. Mean age and mean hemoglobin level showed a trend toward being associated with AI (P = 0.98). Conclusion: The prevalence of biochemical AI in α-thalassemia patients was similar to rates previously reported for NTD β-thalassemia. Annual screening for AI in α-thalassemia patients is recommended, and glucocorticoid replacement should be considered in NTD α-thalassemia patients with AI during critical illness. © 2017 Japan Pediatric Society"

The findings affirm the role and nature trust, communication, and collaboration play in the mediated relationship. In contrast, the mediating power of collaboration is non-significantly stronger than that of communication, and is more than double that of trust.

2-s2.0-85036627346,"Though not a part of mainstream physics, Salam’s theory of strong gravity remains a viable effective model for the description of strong interactions in the gauge singlet sector of QCD, capable of producing particle confinement and asymptotic freedom, but not of reproducing interactions involving SU(3) color charge. It may therefore be used to explore the stability and confinement of gauge singlet hadrons, though not to describe scattering processes that require color interactions. It is a two-tensor theory of both strong interactions and gravity, in which the strong tensor field is governed by equations formally identical to the Einstein equations, apart from the coupling parameter, which is of order 1GeV-1. We revisit the strong gravity theory and investigate the strong gravity field equations in the presence of a mixing term which induces an effective strong cosmological constant, Λ f. This introduces a strong de Sitter radius for strongly interacting fermions, producing a confining bubble, which allows us to identify Λ f with the ‘bag constant’ of the MIT bag model, B≃2×1014gcm-3. Assuming a static, spherically symmetric geometry, we derive the strong gravity TOV equation, which describes the equilibrium properties of compact hadronic objects. From this, we determine the generalized Buchdahl inequalities for a strong gravity ‘particle’, giving rise to upper and lower bounds on the mass/radius ratio of stable, compact, strongly interacting objects. We show, explicitly, that the existence of the lower mass bound is induced by the presence of Λ f, producing a mass gap, and that the upper bound corresponds to a deconfinement phase transition. The physical implications of our results for holographic duality in the context of the AdS/QCD and dS/QCD correspondences are also discussed. © 2017, The Author(s)."

There is no definition in Thailand hospitals to describe prolonged length of stay in EDs. A study is needed to understand which factors impact ED patients and to what extent this occurs. Objective: To determine the factors associated with prolonged length of stay in Public Tertiary Military Royal Thai Air Force Hospital. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study using routinely collected data involving non-traumatic patients presenting to the ED of Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Bangkok over the 6-month period between March and August 2015. The medical records of 2,079 patients were reviewed. Key data were recorded, including patient characteristics, types of health insurance, times of presenting to emergency room, day (weekday/weekend), triage categories, and underlying disease and disease complexity using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) along with diagnosis categories. Results: Univariate analysis revealed several factors that affect ED length of stay. Age, type of health insurance, times of presenting to emergency room, weekend, triage categories, and CCI were all identified as potentially important (p<0.2) and subsequently entered into the multivariable cox regression model. The multivariate model identified age, weekend, underlying disease, and disease complexity, and time of day as all significant predictors of ED length of stay. For every 10 years older a patient is, the chance of discharge is 10% less (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.92, p<0.001). Those admitted on the weekend had 1.18 times the chance of discharge (at any given time) compared to those presenting on weekdays (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p<0.001), and those in the evening shift had a lower chance of discharge compared to those in day shift (Evening shift HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92, p<0.001) Finally, patients with CCI of 3 or more had a 9% less chance of discharge, compare to patients with CCI of 0 to 2 (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94, p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier curves found that triage categories ESI1, ESI2, ESI3 have similar discharge times (a median of approximated 400 minutes), whereas ESI4 and ESI5 patients had a considerably lower median discharge time (340 and 200 minutes, respectively). Conclusion: The majority of patients spent long length of stay in the emergency room and almost all factors in the present study were shown to be associated with prolonged length of stay in the ED. However, the downstream effect of extended ED stay on patient safety and mortality needs further research. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."

The parameters (i.e. cell density, pH of cell suspension and chitosan concentration) affecting the flocculation efficiency of chitosan were investigated. With the optimal condition, the repeated flocculation for phosphate removal in a photobioreactor was demonstrated. The results show that the flocculation efficiency of chitosan depends on cell density, pH of cell suspension and chitosan concentration. The optimal flocculation process could be accomplished by adjusting the pH to 7.2 before adding 20 mg/L chitosan followed by pH adjustment to 7.5. With single inoculation, the sequential process of phosphate removal using cyanobacterial uptake followed by cell flocculation using chitosan with the optimal condition in the photobioreactor was successfully achieved for 12 cycles with water from a recirculating fish tank. © 2017 CIWEM"
2-s2.0-85035060862,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by abnormal accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Recently, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) has emerged as an effective and robust method for detection of common genetic alterations in MM patients. Here, we aimed to confirm MLPA utility for this purpose and furthermore to test the feasibility of a combination of karyotyping, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) and MLPA methods for diagnosis, prognostic assessment and risk stratification of MM. Thirty-five genomic DNA samples isolated from CD138-enriched plasma cells from bone marrow of MM patients were analyzed using the MLPA method. We found that amp (1q) was the most frequent genetic alteration (48.6%) in the tested samples, followed by del (1p) and del (13q) (34.3%). Moreover, concordant results between sensitivity and specificity of iFISH and MLPA for the detection of del (13q) (p-value > 0.05) and del (17p) (p-value > 0.05) were obtained. In summary, we could provide evidence of MLPA assay utility for the detection of common genetic alterations in MM. The combination of karyotyping, iFISH, and MLPA proved very helpful for clinical risk stratification."
2-s2.0-85034639181,"To reveal the reproductive biology in male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), circulating gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) and testicular hormones (testosterone and inhibin) were monitored for 8−12 years in 2 captive bottlenose dolphins (Mars and Regulus). During the study period, Mars was undergoing sexual maturation, whereas Regulus was already mature at the beginning of the study. Assuming that Mars had reached sexual maturity when the significant increase in circulating testosterone levels was observed, serum concentration of inhibin was higher in the sexually immature stage than in the mature stage, whereas the serum concentration of FSH was higher in the sexually mature stage than in the immature stage. No difference was observed in the LH levels between preand post-sexual maturation. There was a significant increase in serum concentration of testosterone during spring in both animals. These results suggest that the mechanism responsible for regulating FSH secretion by inhibin functions during the sexually immature stage in this species. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science."
2-s2.0-85034419484,"Aim: To develop a population pharmacokinetic model and identify sources of variability, genetic and nongenetic factors, of tenofovir. Methods: The ABCC2 and ABCC4 polymorphisms were genotyped in 342 patients. A nonlinear mixed effects model was used to develop the population pharmacokinetic model and investigate the influence of these polymorphisms and other patient specific covariates on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. Results: The estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault equation, concomitant use of lopinavir/ritonavir and ABCC4 3463A>G polymorphism were associated with tenofovir apparent oral clearance (CL/F). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir decreased tenofovir CL/F by 25%. Patients carrying ABCC4 3463 AG or GG had a tenofovir CL/F 11% higher than those with genotype AA. Conclusion: Renal function, co-medication and genetic variation impact the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. These factors should be taken into consideration to guide the individual tenofovir disoproxil fumarate dosage regimen in Thai HIV-infected patients. © 2017 Future Medicine Ltd."
2-s2.0-85035214868,"A search for pair production of massive vector-like T and B quarks in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV is presented. The data set was collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.6 fb−1. The T and B quarks are assumed to decay through three possible channels into a heavy boson (either a W, Z or Higgs boson) and a third generation quark. This search is performed in final states with one charged lepton and several jets, exploiting techniques to identify W or Higgs bosons decaying hadronically with large transverse momenta. No excess over the predicted standard model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the T quark pair production cross section are set that exclude T quark masses below 860 GeV in the singlet, and below 830 GeV in the doublet branching fraction scenario. For other branching fraction combinations with ℬ(T → tH) + ℬ(T → bW) ≥ 0.4, lower limits on the T quark range from 790 to 940 GeV. Limits are also set on pair production of singlet vector-like B quarks, which can be excluded up to a mass of 730 GeV. The techniques showcased here for understanding highly-boosted final states are important as the sensitivity to new particles is extended to higher masses. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85034067324,"Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a cutaneous form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, primarily affecting children. The lesion is presumed to originate from either macrophages or dermal dendritic cells. JXG can rarely present as an isolated intracranial lesion and, in contrast to the dismal outcome of patients with systemic disease, cranial JXG has been shown to carry a more favorable prognosis. Here, we report for the first time 3 pediatric cases of JXG with a BRAF V600E mutation, 2 with intracranial lesions and 1 with cranial lesions. Although these intracranial/cranial lesions have been referred to as JXG, they likely differ from cutaneous JXG in both the clinical features and BRAF status. It may be more appropriate to classify intracranial/cranial JXG in the same group as Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease, which also have a BRAF V600E mutation. Further study of BRAF status in a larger series of JXG is warranted. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85034066338,"Gold quantum dots (AuQDs) are employed as photosensitizers in organic thin-film solar cells (OSCs) to improve their photoelectric conversion properties. Three types of AuQDs with different fluorescence emission wavelengths are used: blue (B-AuQDs), green (G-AuQDs), and red (R-AuQDs). AuQDs are loaded into the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) thin-film layer of OSCs. UV–vis spectra, atomic force microscope images, current density–voltage characteristics, and impedance spectra of the fabricated devices are measured for the three aforementioned types of AuQDs. All types of AuQDs improve the photoelectric conversion properties, and the G-AuQD-loaded OSCs exhibit the best improvement, exhibiting an efficiency increase of 10% compared with OSCs without the AuQDs. The fluorescence/photosensitization of the AuQDs plays an important role in the enhancement of the OSCs. Finite-difference time-domain simulations indicate increased electric field intensity due to a small degree of AuQDs aggregation. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim"
2-s2.0-85034045943,"A series of nickel catalysts i.e. nickel sulfide (NiS), nickel phosphide (NiP) and nickel carbide (NiC) was investigated for hydrotreating of spent coffee oil to produce bio-hydrotreated fuel (BHF). Catalytic tests were carried out at 375–425 °C and 20–40 bar of initial H2 pressure (before heating) with reaction time of 0–3 h. The activity of the catalysts are in the order of NiC > NiP > NiS; however NiC tended to promote cracking reaction resulting in high gasoline and gaseous yields. On the other hand, although NiS gives the lowest oil conversion, it is favorable to diesel yield with lowest methanation and cracking activity. Compared with decarboxylation (DCO2) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation (DCO) was the major route for deoxygenation of coffee oil for all the catalysts. The ratio of (DCO + DCO2) to HDO (as represented by Cn-1/Cn) decreased in the order NiS > NiC > NiP. Ketones as intermediate products (ca. 3 wt%) were detected in case of NiP. They could be generated via rearrangement of alcohol and keto-enol tautomerism. Significant amount of aromatics (4 wt%) with some isomerization products (0.9 wt%) can also be observed in NiS catalyzed liquid products while trace amount of these compounds were detected for NiP and NiC catalysts. Physiochemical analysis of the diesel fraction exhibited satisfactory properties. The density and kinematic viscosity were consistent with the specification of commercial bio-hydrogenated diesel, NExBTL. Since main products are straight chain hydrocarbons, high cetane index (>110) could be achieved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85034116791,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based power plant incorporating an oxyfuel combustion process to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is analyzed. The effects of key parameters, such as the steam-to-carbon ratio, fuel utilization factor, and temperature, on the current density, voltage, heat production, and requirements of each unit are investigated. In addition, the overall performance of the SOFC–oxyfuel integrated systems with anode recycling and steam recycling are studied and compared. The SOFC system with anode recycling provides better electrical efficiency than that with steam recycling because of the high utilization of fuel in the SOFC and the ability to integrate a fuel turbine. In the SOFC with steam recycling, a fuel turbine cannot be implemented because there is insufficient heat for preheating the inlet streams, which is primarily used to vaporize the recycling stream. The conditions for SOFC–oxyfuel combustion in systems with anode or steam recycling that provide the optimum electrical efficiency are also analyzed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85034422451,"Background: HIV-related stigma and discrimination is a significant driver of the HIV and AIDS epidemic. UNAIDS encourages all nations to monitor progress toward elimination of this problem. This study measured the level of stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV (PLHIV) among Thai adults in the general population using recommended global tools. Methods: Data from the 5th National Health Examination Survey, conducted in 2014 were used. The survey utilized six questions recommended by the Global Stigma and Discrimination Indicator Working Group and was administered to participants aged 20–59 years old. All analyses were weighted to take into account of the probability of sampling the same-age Thai population. Factors related to a discriminatory attitude according to UNAIDS, defined as agreed to at least one of the two discriminatory issues, were evaluated using Chi square tested and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of the 10,522 respondents, the most prevalent stigmatizing attitude was anticipated stigma (76.9%), followed by perceived stigma (69.2%), fear of HIV infection (57.0%), and social judgment (38.2%). Fifty-eight point six percent had discriminatory attitudes according to the UNAIDS global indicator. Independent predictors were being female (AOR = 1.21: 95% CI 1.14–1.29), aged 20–39 (AOR = 1.19: 95% CI 1.09–1.30) or 50–59 (AOR = 1.18: 95%CI 1.12–1.26), being Muslim (AOR = 2.03: 95%CI 1.55–2.66), earning < 10,000 Baht/month (AOR = 0.93: 95%CI 0.88–0.99), and living in the Northeast (AOR = 1.67: 95%CI 1.39–2.00) or in Bangkok (AOR = 1.73: 95%CI 1.45–2.07). Conclusions: More than half of the general adult Thai population had stigmatizing attitudes toward PLHIV. The study provided valuable baseline information which could be used as comparison for follow-up surveys with other countries.

2-s2.0-85032803453,"Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied. Material and methods Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA. Results At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%. Conclusion OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85032939884,"Problem Demand for long-term care services for older people is increasing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. Countries need to establish national long-term care systems that are sustainable and equitable. Approach The Governments of Costa Rica and Thailand have implemented broadly comparable interventions to deploy volunteers in long-term home care. Both countries trained older volunteers from local communities to make home visits to impoverished and vulnerable older people and to facilitate access to health services and other social services. Local setting Costa Rica and Thailand are upper-middle-income countries with strong traditions of community-based health services that they are now extending into long-term care for older people. Relevant changes Between 2003 and 2013 Thailand’s programme trained over 51 000 volunteers, reaching almost 800 000 older people. Between 2010 and 2016 Costa Rica established 50 community care networks, serving around 10 000 people and involving over 5000 volunteers. Despite some evidence of benefits to the physical and mental health of older people and greater uptake of other services, a large burden of unmet care needs and signs of a growth of unregulated private services still exist. Lessons learnt There is scope for low- and middle-income countries to develop large-scale networks of community-based long-term care volunteers. The capacity of volunteers to enhance the quality of life of clients is affected by the local availability of care services. Volunteer care networks should be complemented by other initiatives, including training about health in later life for volunteers, and investment in community long-term care services. © 2017, World Health Organization.

To protect against potential negative health effects from rice consumption, As and Cd concentrations in rice sold in Bangkok were determined, and non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessments were conducted. Four types of rice (n = 97), namely, white jasmine, white, glutinous, and brown jasmine, were collected. Samples were acid-digested and analyzed for total concentrations of As and Cd by ICP-MS. The average concentrations of As and Cd were 0.205 ± 0.008 and 0.019 ± 0.001 mg kg−1, respectively. Approximately 22.8, 62.5, and 57.1% of white, white jasmine, and brown jasmine rice, respectively, contained As concentrations exceeding the Codex inorganic As standards for polished and unpolished rice. Brown jasmine rice contained significantly higher As concentrations than the other types of rice. However, Cd concentrations in all rice samples were significantly lower than the Codex standard of 0.4 mg kg−1. Children are exposed to the highest amounts of both elements. Concerning As exposure through the consumption of different types of rice in the same age group, the consumption of brown jasmine rice caused approximately 1.7 to 2.3 times higher As exposure rates compared to the consumption of other types of rice. Non-carcinogenic risks (hazard quotient (HQ)) of As exposure from all types of rice were higher than the threshold limit of 1. HQ in children ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 was significantly higher than HQ in the other age groups.

Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted at a Thai university hospital from October 2015 toMarch 2016. All randomly selected participants wore an activity tracker on their hip for 5 days, except during bathing and sleeping periods, to record step counts and time points. Results: Of 884 nurses, 289 (142 NCPs and 147 NMs) were randomly selected. The average age was 35.87 years. They spent 9.76 and 6.01 hours on work and nonwork activities, respectively. Daily steps per hour were significantly lower during work than nonwork periods (P < .001). An NCP had significantly higher overall hourly PA (P = .002). The number of steps per hour during work period of NCP was significantly higher than that of NM even after adjusting for age, work experience, and body mass index (P = .034).

Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity effects of CIN-RM and RM on H292 lung cancer cells were determined by the MTT assay. We also investigated the mechanism of CIN-RM-mediated apoptosis and mechanism of action of this compound by western blotting. Results: CIN-RM showed more potent cytotoxicity than its parental compound (RM) against H292 lung cancer cells. At concentrations of 15-60 μM, CIN-RM significantly induced apoptosis by increasing expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and activation of caspase-3 and -9. For up-stream mechanism, CIN-RM mediated apoptosis through a p53-dependent mechanism, that consequently down-regulated antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), while increasing the level of pro-apoptotic BCL2-associated X (BAX).

Compound Batatasin III isolated from Dendrobium draconis Rchb.f. was tested for the possible anti-cancer activities including anti-proliferative, antimigration and invasion in human non-small lung cancer H460 cells. Materials and Methods: The effect of Batatasin III on viability and proliferation of H460 cells was investigated by the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Migration and invasion assays were performed. Filopodia formation was determined by phalloidin-rhodamine staining. The hallmark signaling proteins in regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, and migration were determined by western blot analysis. Results: Batatasin III at concentrations lower than 100 μM has no cytotoxic effects. The compound at 25-100 μM exhibited antiproliferative activity at 48 h after treatment. Regarding cell motility, Batatasin III decreased migration and invasion of cells. Filopodia were found to be significantly reduced in Batatasin III treated cells. These effects correlated with the results from western blot analysis showing that the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase on Try397 (p-FAK (Try397)), the active protein kinase B (AKT), and cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) were significantly reduced. Besides, Batatasin III significantly suppressed EMT indicated by the decrease of N-cadherin and Vimentin, and up-regulation of E-cadherin. Conclusion: Batatasin III has anti-cancer activities; inhibits cancer migration and invasion by suppressing EMT.

The most suitable DME extraction condition was found to be 33:0.5 (w/w) DME to dried marigold flowers ratio and at 35 °C, giving 20.65 mg of total xanthophylls/g of dried marigold flowers. Following extraction, the suitable de-esterification conditions to convert the extracted lutein fatty acid ester (the major compound in xanthophylls) to free lutein, a more bio-available form, were determined to be 2.5%w/v KOH–EtOH, at 35 °C for 4 h. While employing the most suitable conditions in each of the two steps gave favorable free lutein yield (16.65 mg free lutein/g dried marigold flowers), a one-step process in which simultaneous extraction and de-esterification carried out at the most suitable condition: the DME to dried marigold flowers ratio 33:0.5 (w/w), EtOH to dried marigold flowers ratio 10:0.5, 5% KOH–EtOH concentration, at 35 °C for 1 h, could lead to about 20% improvement (20.71 mg free lutein/g dried marigold flowers).

2-s2.0-85031327856,"In our previous works, two techniques (freeze-drying and salt-leaching) were introduced to fabricate the sericin/poly(vinyl alcohol)/glycerin scaffolds. The freeze-dried and salt-leached sericin/poly(vinyl alcohol)/glycerin scaffolds with the same composition showed distinguished physical and in vitro biological characteristics. In this study, the in vivo safety and efficacy tests of both scaffolds as dressing materials for the healing of full-thickness wounds in rat model were performed in comparison with the clinically used dressing, Allevyn®. In the safety test, the scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously, and the signs of tissue irritation including the extent of inflammatory cells, calcification, vascularization, and fatty infiltration were scored. In the efficacy test, the scaffolds were applied to the full-thickness wound (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm), and the epithelialization and collagen formation in the wound were evaluated. Both freeze-dried and salt-leached scaffolds were characterized as non- to slightly irritant implantable materials. The freeze-dried scaffold minimally causes irritation to the tissue possibly because it was derived from the non-chemical relevant process. Furthermore, the freeze-dried scaffold showed the highest wound healing efficiency as characterized by the fastest epithelialization and highest extent of collagen formation. This might be due to the more sustained release of sericin from the freeze-dried scaffold, compared to that of the salt-leached scaffold. Therefore, fabrication process seemed to directly regulate the properties and applicability of the scaffolds. The safety and efficacy of the dressing materials in wound healing application depended not only on the materials themselves but also on the fabrication process that produces them. © SAGE Publications."

Materials and Methods: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant publications related to PROMs used in RAS. Publications were selected based on predefined criteria. All identified PROMs were then classified by measuring concepts and assessed for instrument characteristics and evidence for quality properties for RAS patients. Results: Twenty-eight PROMs were used in studies of RAS patients. Instruments focused upon oral symptoms (n = 4), psychosocial status (n = 15) and quality of life (n = 9). Five PROMs (Oral Health-related Quality of Life-UK, Chronic Oral Mucosal Disease Questionnaire, Oral Health Impact Profile-14, Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 and Mumcu's composite index) were found to have some evidence of psychometric performance. No PROMs showed evidence for interpretability of their scores in RAS patients. Conclusion: There was a wide range of PROMs used in clinical studies of RAS. The majority of these PROMs lack evidence of measurement properties and interpretability for RAS patients.

The results revealed that less degree of crystallinity, higher viscosity and more crosslinked structure were detected as increasing amount of DCP and N3300. Subsequently, a compression moulding technique was used to prepare PBS foam with a chemical blowing agent, i.e. azodicarbonamide (ADC). Scanning Electron Microscopy was acquired to examine cell size, cell size distribution, cell structure, and cell density. Besides, physical properties, e.g. foam density and physical appearance, were investigated. The results indicate that the degree of crystallinity, viscosity, and crosslinked structure affect the morphological and physical properties of PBS foams, i.e. greater viscosity and crosslinked structure causing obstacle for cell growth, and less degree of crystallinity allowing easier cell nucleation and cell growth. © Smithers Information Ltd. 2017"
2-s2.0-85032732535,"We explore the possibility that inflation is driven by supersymmetry breaking with the superpartner of the goldstino (sgoldstino) playing the role of the inflaton. Moreover, we impose an R-symmetry that allows one to satisfy easily the slow-roll conditions, avoiding the so-called η-problem, and leads to two different classes of small-field inflation models; they are characterised by an inflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential, where R-symmetry is either restored or spontaneously broken, with the inflaton rolling down to a minimum describing the present phase of our Universe. To avoid the Goldstone boson and be left with a single (real) scalar field (the inflaton), R-symmetry is gauged with the corresponding gauge boson becoming massive. This framework generalises a model studied recently by the present authors, with the inflaton identified by the string dilaton and R-symmetry together with supersymmetry restored at weak coupling, at infinity of the dilaton potential. The presence of the D-term allows a tuning of the vacuum energy at the minimum. The proposed models agree with cosmological observations and predict a tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations [InlineEquation not available: see fulltext.] and an inflation scale [InlineEquation not available: see fulltext.] GeV. H∗ may be lowered up to electroweak energies only at the expense of fine-tuning the scalar potential. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85030154266,"Conducting polymer composite films containing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was prepared by solid state polymerization (SSP) of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (DBEDOT) in the matrices of polystyrene (PS), sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). A thin fiber mat was first fabricated by electrospinning a mixed solution of the polymer matrix and DBEDOT on glass slides. The SSP of the DBEDOT embedded in the polymer matrix was then induced by heating at 60–80 °C, which resulted in a dark blue PEDOT composite film, structurally confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. It was found that compression during heating produced better dispersed PEDOT particles in the polymer matrix. The conductivity of the composite fiber was found to reach as high as approximately 13, 14 and 32 S/cm for the PEDOT/PS, PEDOT/SPS and PEDOT/PMMA composite films, respectively. These conductivity values are comparable to that of the pure PEDOT generated directly by SSP in the absence of a polymer matrix. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85031903526,"In this study, we screened and isolated D-lactic acid-producing bacteria from soil and tree barks collected in Thailand. Among the isolates obtained, Terrilactibacillus laevilacticus SK5-6 exhibited good D-lactate production in the primary screening fermentation (99.27 g/L final lactate titer with 0.90 g/g yield, 1.38 g/L⋅h, and 99.00% D-enantiomer equivalent). Terrilactibacillus laevilacticus SK5-6 is a Gram-positive, endospore-forming, homofermentative D-lactate producer that can ferment a wide range of sugars to produce D-lactate. Unlike the typical D-lactate producers, such as catalase-negative Sporolactobacillus sp., T. laevilacticus SK5-6 possesses catalase activity; therefore, a two-phase fermentation was employed for D-lactate production. During an aerobic preculture stage, a high-density cell mass was rapidly obtained due to aerobic respiration. When transferred to the fermentation stage at the correct physiological stage (inoculum age) and proper concentration of cell mass (inoculum size), T. laevilacticus rapidly converted glucose into D-lactate under anaerobic conditions, resulting in a high final lactate titer (102.22 g/L), high yield (0.84 g/g), and high productivity (2.13 g/L⋅h). When the process conditions were shifted from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, unlike other lactate-producing bacteria, the mixed acid fermentation route was not activated in the culture of T. laevilacticus SK5-6 during the fermentation stage when some trace oxygen still remained. Our study demonstrates the excellent characteristics of this isolate for D-lactate production; in particular, a high product yield was obtained without byproduct formation. Based on these key characteristics of T. laevilacticus SK5-6, we suggest that this isolate is a novel D-lactate producer for use in industrial fermentation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and the University of Milan."
2-s2.0-85030701631,"Objectives The aim of this study is to compare the cost and benefit of four different cervical cancer screening strategies involving primary HPV 16/18 genotyping, hrHPV testing alone and cytology for detecting CIN2 +. Methods Economical analysis using Markov modeling approach to combine the epidemiological data from current population-based study of The National Cancer Institute of Thailand. A cohort of 100,000 hypothetical female population age 30–65 years was simulated in each strategy. The compared strategies are HPV 16/18 genotyping with reflexed cytology, hrHPV testing alone followed by colposcopy, Papanicolaou standard cytology and liquid based cytology followed by colposcopy. The interval of screening was 5 years' interval. The main outcomes were defined as a number of CIN2 + cases and cost per 100,000 women screening over 35 years. Results Model predictions indicated that, the most cost-effectiveness strategy is hrHPV testing alone by reducing cost and also increase CIN2 + detection rate. It identify an additional 130 cases and decrease cost by 46,950,840 THB (1,394,441 USD) per 100,000 women screened when compared to HPV 16/18 genotyping. Compared with cytology, hrHPV testing decrease cost by 51,279,781 THB (1,523,011 USD) and detected more 506 cases of CIN2 +. From sensitivity analysis, the cost of HPV testing, cost of colposcopy, incidence of HPV infection and sensitivity of cytology may affect the results. (1 USD = 33.67 Baht). Conclusion The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis support the full scale implementation of HPV testing as a primary cervical cancer screening in Thailand. © 2017 The Authors"
2-s2.0-85029833213,"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius commonly colonizes the skin of dogs, whilst nasal carriage may occur in humans who are in contact with dogs or the environment of veterinary hospitals. Genes encoding cell wall-associated (CWA) proteins have been described in Staphylococcus aureus but knowledge of their occurrence in S. pseudintermedius is still limited. The aim of the study was to develop a method to detect S. pseudintermedius surface protein genes (sps) encoding CWA proteins, and to examine the distribution of the genes in isolates from different sources. Four multiplex PCR assays (mPCR) were developed for detection of 18 sps genes, with 4–5 genes detected per mPCR. These were applied to 135 S. pseudintermedius isolates from carriage sites (n = 35) and infected sites (n = 35) in dogs, from the nasal cavity of humans (n = 25), and from the environment of a veterinary hospital (n = 40). The mPCRs were shown to detect all 18 known sps genes, and no discrepancies were found between uniplex and mPCR results. The mPCRs could detect at least 1 pg/μl of DNA template. A total of 23 sps gene profiles were found among the 135 isolates, with diverse gene combinations. Only spsD, spsF, spsI, spsO, spsP, and spsQ were not detected in all isolates. spsP and spsQ were more frequently detected in the canine isolates from infected sites than from carriage sites. This finding suggests that these two genes may play a role in pathogenicity, whereas the presence of the 12 sps genes may contribute to adherence function at all surfaces where carriage occurs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85029472472,"Cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R) possesses anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-glycation properties. Methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive dicarbonyl aldehyde by-product of glycolysis, is a precursor of advanced glycation end products and contributes to vascular dysfunction, particularly during hyperglycemia. We investigated the possible inherent vasoactivity of C3R, and its effectiveness against MG-induced vascular abnormalities in isolated blood vessel preparations from male Wistar Kyoto rat. C3R induced vasorelaxation concentration-dependently in aortic rings (92% maximum relaxation; EC50: 2.43 ± 0.57 μM) and in perfused-mesenteric arterial bed (61% maximum relaxation; EC50: 25.0 ± 1.26 μM) pre-contracted with noradrenaline (NA). The vasorelaxation actions of C3R were endothelium-dependent and mediated primarily via nitric oxide (NO) as evidenced by the absence of relaxation in endothelium-denuded preparations as well as in the presence of Nω-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Intravenous administration of C3R (15–25 μmol/kg body weight) in anesthetized rats significantly reduced mean arterial blood pressure (11–23%). Pre-treatment with MG (500 μM) potentiated the vasoconstriction elicited by NA and impaired vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine that was fully restored to basal levels in the presence of C3R (3 μM). Taken together, C3R exerts multiple benefits on the vasculature, complementing its potential as a candidate anti-glycation agent. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"
2-s2.0-85029010519,"High ambient temperature (HTa) activates both behavioral and autonomic responses. Decreased food intake (FI) is a well-known behavioral response under HTa. In general, this behavioral response seems to be mediated under the activation of the stress axis. The present study, however, revealed that decreased FI after a low degree of HTa appeared to be activated earlier than stress axis activation. By comparing low and high levels of HTa exposure in rats, the present experiment demonstrated that the HTa-induced decrease in FI was clear in both conditions. However, only the high degree HTa rats showed prominent physiological responses to HTa. The results indicated that low degree HTa exposure decreased FI earlier than activated physiological responses. Using the low degree HTa condition, the next experiment revealed that only the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and arcuate nucleus (Arc) were activated. These results suggested that the MnPO and Arc (MnPO-Arc) are apparently involved in the low degree HTa effect on FI and that the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, which is the upper part of the stress axis, was not associated with this effect. A separate experiment also showed no differences in the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations from many selected nuclei. This result suggested that the effect of HTa to decrease FI via the MnPO-Arc was not associated with CRF. The current findings introduce a new behavioral aspect of the HTa effect on FI, representing important information to explain the mechanism of obesity relative to environmental conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85029530791,"Background Currently Minimally Invasive Plate Osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique for tibial shaft fracture management has gained wide attention. However, an increased intracompartmental pressure after the plate insertion may result in postoperative acute compartment syndrome. We reported the difference of immediate effect of percutaneous plate insertion using 2 approaches of MIPO technique on anterior compartment pressure of the legs. Materials and methods Eight soft cadaveric legs (one female and three males) without previous history of skeletal trauma or surgery were infused with normal saline to create the sustained intracompartmental pressure of 20 mm Hg in all four compartments. The Synthes® 4.5 mm 11-hole Narrow Locking Compression Plate was inserted via anteromedial and anterolateral approach. Anterior compartment pressure was measured by portable digital monitoring device through side-port needle (Stryker® Intracompartmental Monitoring Device) before and after plate insertion for each approach. Results By using anteromedial approach, a mean of anterior compartment pressure was increased by 0.375 mm Hg after plate insertion (5 of 8 legs had no change in pressure and the remaining 3 resulted in 1 mm Hg pressure elevation). For anterolateral plate insertion, all of the 8 legs had an elevation of anterior compartment pressure with a mean of 3.5 mm Hg (ranged from 2 to 6 mm Hg). Conclusions When both approaches were compared to each other, the anterolateral plate insertion resulted in higher intracompartmental pressure elevation of the anterior compartment than the anteromedial approach. Surgeon should be more aware of acute compartment syndrome when considering the anterolateral approach in treating close tibial fracture. However, in patients with suspected acute compartment syndrome, close observation and continuous monitoring of the intracompartmental pressure is still imperative for all healthcare provider. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

This heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully fabricated via a facile heat treatment under atmosphere. The enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers and narrow band gap confer superior photocatalytic activities with 5.728 mmol/g photogenerated hydrogen gas for 5 h and 52.395 mmol/g for 64 h in triethanolamine aqueous solution. The apparent quantum efficiency of C-TiO2/g-C3N4 is ~ 6.2% under 420 nm irradiation, which is about 2.4 times higher than the corresponding value 2.6% of pristine g-C3N4.

2-s2.0-85029452820,"Background Three-dimensional cortical surface reconstruction (3DCSR) is an important tool for operations involving cerebral cortex, but data on its similarity to actual cortical architecture are lacking. In this study, the authors systematically tested the similarity between operative findings and 3DCSR built by a neuronavigation system and illustrated its applications. Methods The authors retrospectively retrieved operative photographs and 3DCSR of patients who underwent craniotomy with the aid of 3DCSR and asked 4 evaluators to perform a series of matching tests. Test 1 was to match 3DCSR and operative photographs. Test 2 was a repetition of test 1 to determine the consistency of matching ability. Test 3 was to match detailed anatomy of the 3DCSR with operative photographs. Scores on all tests were analyzed to measure the degree of similarity between 3DCSR and operative findings. The scores between patients with and without cortical distortion were compared to determine the impact of distortion on matching ability. Results Tests of similarity were performed on 22 patients. Mean scores of tests 1, 2, and 3 were 84.09%, 93.18%, and 89.77%, respectively. The Kappa statistic for agreement between test 1 and 2 ranged from 0.76 to 0.88. There was no statistically significant difference between average score of patients with and without cortical distortion in all tests. Conclusions Authors have systematically demonstrated that 3DCSR built by neuronavigation system in this study provides detailed anatomy of cortical surface with a high degree of similarity to operative findings even in the presence of cortical distortion, leading to various applications beyond navigation alone. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

The developed technique applies to both locally Lipschitz as well as monotonic nonlinear systems, and allows for nonlinear functions in both the process dynamics and output equations. The LMI design condition obtained is less conservative than all previous results proposed in the literature for these classes of nonlinear systems. By judicious use of a modified Young's relation, additional degrees of freedom are included in the observer design. These additional decision variables enable improvements in the feasibility of the obtained LMI. Several recent results in the literature are shown to be particular cases of the more general observer design methodology developed in this paper.

2-s2.0-85028055860,"The industrial production of chemicals and energy carriers has grown enormously with the support of new technologies. A proper assessment is needed to provide broader aspects for long-term sustainability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery based on lignocellulosic biomass feedstock using emergy analysis and to propose the method to minimize material consumption and waste. The concept of emergy is to express the record of all resources used by the biosphere in earlier steps to produce a product or service, in term of solar energy equivalence. This idea provides the quantitative indicators involving the resource use and the percent renewability of the systems. For the proposed biorefinery model, Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) grown in Thailand was used as lignocellulosic feedstock. An emergy assessment was performed in two parts, comprised of the evaluation of the feedstock cultivation and of a biorefinery producing liquid fuels, methanol, steam, electricity and other by products, i.e., high purity CO2, sulfur. The emergy results revealed that the bio-based products depend mostly on non-renewable resources used in both biomass cultivation and biorefinery stages. For Napier grass cultivation, most of the emergy support came from local resources in term of evapotranspiration of Napier grass (33%) and the diesel consumption during the cultivation process (21%). The emergy sustainability indicator of the cultivation was 0.81. The emergy sustainability indicator of the whole process from cultivation to biorefinery stages dropped to 0.25, since the biorefinery section required solely economic inputs of which most were non-renewable. In conclusion, the implementation of the integrated biorefinery concept could minimize material consumption and waste generation and it also has higher performance in terms of the emergy compared to other existing processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85027402434,"Introduction Stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) were suggested as the stem cell source in regenerative endodontic procedures. However, bone and/or cementum-like structure were observed in root canals. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in infected root canals might alter SCAPs' osteogenic differentiation pattern. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of LPS on SCAPs' proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Methods The mesenchymal stem cell characteristics of SCAPs were confirmed. Cell viability was tested with Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS at concentration between 0.001 and 5 μg/mL. SCAPs were pretreated with those concentrations for 168 hours. Then SCAPs were further investigated for cell proliferation by resazurin-based assay. Mineralization capacity was determined by alizarin red S staining. Odontoblast marker was determined by DSPP gene expression. General bone and cementum markers, BSP and OPN, were also determined. Determination of the expression levels of these genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Results SCAPs demonstrated the mesenchymal stem cell characteristics. All LPS concentrations did not affect cell viability. Pretreatment with LPS also did not affect cell proliferation and mineralization in every concentration. There was no significant difference between DSPP and OPN gene expression levels at all concentrations. However, LPS at 5 μg/mL significantly increased BSP gene expression. Conclusions Under the limitations of this in vitro study, LPS did not affect SCAP proliferation and mineralization. However, LPS at high concentration, 5 μg/mL, increased BSP gene expression. © 2017 American Association of Endodontists"

2-s2.0-85029227305,"Background Once daily regimens are preferred for HIV-1 treatment, to facilitate adherence and improve quality of life. We compared a new once daily formulation of raltegravir to the currently marketed twice daily formulation. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, non-inferiority study, we enrolled participants aged 18 years or older with HIV-1 RNA of 1000 or more copies per mL and no previous antiretroviral treatment at 139 sites worldwide. We randomly assigned participants (2:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to raltegravir 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) orally once daily or raltegravir 400 mg (one tablet) orally twice daily, each with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine orally once daily, for up to 96 weeks. A computer-generated allocation schedule stratified randomisation by screening HIV-1 RNA value and co-infection with hepatitis B or C. Participants, sponsor personnel, investigators, and study site personnel involved in the treatment or evaluation of the participants were unaware of the treatment group assignments. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 40 copies per mL at week 48 assessed with the US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than −10%. We assessed efficacy and safety in all participants who received one dose or more of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02131233. Findings Between May 26, 2014, and Dec 5, 2014, 802 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, 533 to once daily treatment and 269 to twice daily; 797 received study therapy, 531 once daily and 266 twice daily. At week 48, 472 (89%) of 531 once daily recipients and 235 (88%) of 266 twice daily recipients achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 40 copies per mL (treatment difference 0·5%, 95% CI −4·2 to 5·2). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 130 (24%) of 531 participants in the once daily group (one of which was serious; none led to treatment discontinuation) and 68 (26%) of 266 participants in the twice daily group (two of which were serious; two led to treatment discontinuation). The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea (39 [7%] vs 18 [7%]), headache (16 [3%] vs 12 [5%]), and dizziness (12 [2%] vs eight [3%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Interpretation A once daily raltegravir 1200 mg regimen was non-inferior compared with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection. These results support the use of raltegravir 1200 mg once daily for first-line therapy. Funding Merck & Co, Inc. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Many Pacific Rim economies suffer from severe and worsening air pollution. Particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) is associated with acute and chronic health effects and is a widely used air quality indicator. This paper reports on PM regulation in selected Pacific Rim economies, focusing on PM2.5, and provides recommendations on air quality regulation to economies without current standards Through workshops held by the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU) Global Health Program, experts in air pollution from eight universities in eight Pacific Rim economies characterized current PM2.5 standards and monitoring in their economies, and then collaboratively created recommendations. A great diversity of air pollution exposures exists in the Pacific Rim. While some economies experience low levels of exposure, others have PM levels that are among the highest in the world. The health effects of air pollution are a concern everywhere, but few economies carry out in-depth, local impact assessments and comprehensive air quality monitoring to provide evidence for guidelines and standards. The development of regulations and policies addressing PM2.5 pollution is urgently needed in many Pacific Rim economies. The international literature provides a robust guide to local risks and should be used, in combination with country-specific population-directed air monitoring, to guide decisions on policies addressing this important global health problem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

In this study, we aimed to investigate clonogenicity, proliferation and expression of certain pluripotent markers, considered to be characteristics of PDL stemness, in response to treatment with exogenously-added PGE2. Material and methods Human PDL cells were cultured and treated with various doses of PGE2, and the aforementioned characteristics of PDL stemness were analyzed. Results The clonogenicity and proliferation were significantly enhanced by PGE2 at low concentrations (0.01, 0.1 and 1 ng/ml; P < 0.05), but only the proliferation was significantly diminished by PGE2 at a high concentration (100 ng/ml; P < 0.05). Expression of NANOG and OCT4 mRNA and protein was increased by PGE2 treatment at 0.1 and 1 ng/ml. Consistently, expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen 4, a putative stem cell marker, was significantly augmented by PGE2 treatment at 1 ng/ml (P < 0.05). Conclusion Our findings suggest that although a high dose of PGE2 (100 ng/ml) inhibits proliferation of PDL cells, PGE2 at low doses appears to play a role in the maintenance of PDL stemness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Study Design: This study was conducted by The Thai Society of Cytology and involved 124 laboratories in 76 provinces during 2010-2014. Random sampling suggested recalling of 10% of slides defined as negative at routine screenings (10% random rescreening [R10] model) directly from the reading unit. Results: Out of 330,075 smears covered by the rescreening project throughout its 5-year duration, the rates of abnormal, unsatisfactory, and normal results were 0.63, 1.82, and 97.55%, respectively. Abnormal findings were largely represented by ASC-US (54%) and L-SIL (21%). The average false-negative rate (FNR) measured at the level of L-SIL and higher was 13.8%. Conclusion: The national project was developed to address the accuracy of cervical cancer screening and to promote internal quality assurance based on the R10, on-site surveys, and education.

2-s2.0-85022210143,"Background Insulin resistance (IR) is a key factor in diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity and may occur in mood disorders and tobacco use disorder (TUD), where disturbances of immune-inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways are important shared pathophysiological pathways. Methods This study aimed to a) examine IR and β-cell function as measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin sensitivity and β cell function (HOMA-B) and glucotoxicity (conceptualized as increased glucose levels versus lowered HOMA-B values) in 74 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, with and or without MetS and TUD, versus 46 healthy controls, and b) whether IR is associated with IO&NS biomarkers, including nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp) and uric acid. Results Mood disorders are not associated with changes in IR or glucotoxicity, although the number of mood episodes may increase IR. 47.8% of the variance in HOMA-IR is explained by AOPP and body mass index (BMI, both positively) and NOx, Hp and TUD (all inversely). 43.2% of the variance in HOMA-B is explained by NOx, Hp and age (all inversely associated) and higher BMI and sex. The glucotoxic index is strongly associated with NOx, Hp and BMI (positively), male gender and lower education. Limitations This is a cross-sectional study and therefore we cannot draw firm conclusions on causal associations. Conclusions Activated IO&NS pathways (especially increased Hp and NOx) increase glucotoxicity and exert very complex effects modulating IR. Mood disorders are not associated with increased IR. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85026431206,"Objectives Chemokine receptors have been shown to overexpress in several cancer types. Binding of chemokines to their cognate chemokine receptors on tumor cells can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. The purposes of this study was to examine the expression of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, in salivary gland neoplasms and its association with pathologic characteristics. Design Sixty-two cases of salivary gland neoplasms, including 25 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC), 18 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC), 14 pleomorphic adenomas (PA) and 5 polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) were investigated for CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression immunohistochemically. The immunoreactivity was categorized as low expression or high expression group, based on whether the positive staining was below or higher than 50% of the neoplastic cells, respectively. Results The majority of MECs, ACCs and PLGAs showed high CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression, whereas most PAs showed high CXCR4 but low CXCR7 expression. The levels of CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression were significantly correlated. In MECs, the expression of both chemokine receptors was localized to squamous cells, intermediate cells and glandular epithelial cells, whereas mucous cells and clear cells were negative. In ACCs and PAs, their immunoreactivity was more intense in ductal cells than myoepithelial cells. Most neoplastic myoepithelial cells in PAs did not express CXCR7, while those in ACCs showed strong CXCR7 expression. The increased CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with advanced pathologic grade of MECs (P = 0.03). Conclusion Overexpression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 is common in the 4 salivary gland neoplasms investigated. CXCR4 may play a role in the progression of MECs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85021454695,"A shrimp disease, the so-called acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is caused by a specific strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) and it has resulted in significant losses to the global shrimp farming industry. In our previous study, three of tachylectin-like genes were cloned and characterized from the intestine of Penaeus monodon, designated as Penlectin5-1 (PL5-1), Penlectin5-2 (PL5-2) and Penlectin5-3 (PL5-3). These three genes all contain fibrinogen-related domain (FReD). The expression level of PL5-1, PL5-2 and PL5-3 was elevated in the stomach after oral administration with AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus 3HP (VP3HP). A polyclonal antibody to PL5-2 was successfully produced in a rabbit using the purified recombinant PL5-2 as an immunogen, and this because only the predominant protein PL5-2 could be successfully purified from shrimp plasma by affinity chromatography using a N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine column allowed us to perform functional studies of this lectin. The native purified PL5-2 protein had binding and agglutination activities towards VP3HP. To further understand the functions and the involvements of this lectin in response to AHPND in shrimp, RNAi-mediated knockdown of PL5-1, PL5-2 or PL5-3 was performed prior to an oral administration of VP3HP. As a result, Penlectin5-silencing in shrimp challenged with VP3HP showed higher mortality and resulted in more severe histopathological changes in the hepatopancreas with typical signs of AHPND. These results therefore suggest a role for crustacean fibrinogen-related proteins (FRePs) in innate immune response during the development of AHPND, and maybe also during other infections. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85021165709,"A simple, rapid, sensitive, and economical method based on colorimetry for the determination of paraquat, a widely used herbicide, was developed. Citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized as the colorimetric probe. The mechanism of the assay is related to the aggregation of negatively charged AgNPs as induced by positively-charged paraquat resulting from coulombic attraction which causes the color to change from a deep greenish yellow to pale yellow in accordance with the concentrations of paraquat. Silica gel was exploited as the paraquat adsorbent for purification and pre-concentration prior to the direct determination with negatively charged AgNPs without the requirement of the elution step. The validity of the proposed approach was evaluated by spiking standard paraquat in water and plant samples. Recoveries of paraquat in water samples were 93.6% and 95.4% for groundwater and canal water, respectively, while those in plant samples were 89.5% and 86.6% for Chinese cabbage and green apple, respectively,after using the optimized extraction procedure. The absorbance of AgNPs at 400 nm was linearly related to the concentration of paraquat over the range of 0.05–50 mg L−1, with detection limits of 0.05 mg L−1 for water samples, and 0.10 mg L−1 for plant samples by naked eye determination. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85023622254,"Some fractographic and metallographic contributions to understanding fatigue crack growth in metallic materials are reviewed, with an emphasis on environmentally assisted fatigue. The formation of ductile and brittle striations at intermediate-to-high ΔK, where each stress cycle produces a striation, is reasonably well understood at the microscopic level, but the details of the dislocation activity involved are still controversial. The evidence suggests that, in fairly benign environments, egress of dislocations around crack tips predominates, whereas environmentally assisted fatigue crack growth of many materials in liquid-metal, hydrogen, and aqueous environments involves an adsorption-induced dislocation-emission (AIDE) process at crack tips. There is also fractographic evidence that nanovoids often form just ahead of crack tips at intermediate-to-high ΔK in all environments. The effects of variables such as solution composition, electrode potential, and cycle frequency can be qualitatively explained largely in terms of surface-reaction kinetics and adsorbed-hydrogen coverage in many cases, but a quantitative understanding is lacking. Fatigue crack growth at low ΔK, even in inert environments, is not well understood, and only speculative explanations can be offered. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85020298255,"Tachylectin5A and its homolog, tachylectin5B both contain a fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) and have been studied in horseshoe crabs, Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and shown to be involved in host defense. Here, we demonstrate the presence of tachylectin5-like genes in shrimp, Penaeus monodon, designated as Penlectin5-1 (PL5-1) and Penlectin5-2 (PL5-2), which both contain a signal peptide and a single FReD with an acetyl group and a calcium binding sites and they are both structurally similar to horseshoe crab tachylectin/carcinolectin5. The PL5-1and PL5-2 transcript were expressed in various shrimp tissues in normal shrimp, and their expression was upregulated in tissues such as hemocytes and hindgut following challenge with pathogenic Vibrio harveyi. The PL5-2 protein was detected in various tissues as well as in cell-free hemolymph. The biological function of the PL5-2 protein is to recognize some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria regardless whether they are non-pathogenic or pathogenic. They have hemagglutination activity on human erythrocyte and bacterial agglutination activity to both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. Possible binding sites of PL5-2 to bacteria could be at the N-acetyl moiety of the GlcNAc-MurNAc cell wall of the peptidoglycan since the binding could be inhibited by GlcNAc or GalNAC. The presence of PL5-2 protein in both circulating hemolymph and intestine, where host and microbes are usually interacting, may suggest that the physiological function of shrimp tachylectin-like proteins is to recognize and bind to invading bacteria to immobilize and entrap these microbes and subsequently clear them from circulation and the host body, and probably to control and maintain the normal flora in the intestine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019390260,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of optic pathway glioma (OPG) is highly variable and unpredictable. We present a pilot study of the prognostic role of conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) in the evaluation of OPG. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 17 patients with 20 pretreatment OPG lesions who underwent conventional and DCE MRI between January 2010 and December 2016. Conventional MRI was evaluated for enhancement pattern, cystic component, optic nerve tortuosity, optic nerve dural ectasia, and optic nerve perineural thickening. The DCE MRI data were analyzed for quantitative parameters using the two-compartment pharmacokinetic model (Ktrans, kep, and ve) and for semiquantitative parameters based on time-signal intensity curve (AUC60, peak, and wash-in). The results were compared with the clinically progressive or nonprogressive tumor. RESULTS: Five progressive OPGs and 15 nonprogressive OPGs were included. Conventional MRI findings of diffuse enhancement and cystic component were significantly correlated with progressive OPGs (both P =.01). Conventional MRI yielded sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 90%. Ktrans, kep, and ve as well as AUC60, peak, and wash-in were significantly higher in progressive OPGs (P <.05). Using DCE MRI increased diagnostic performance up to a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93%, and accuracy of 95%. CONCLUSION: DCE MRI accurately distinguished progressive and nonprogressive OPGs, with high sensitivities and specificities. DCE MRI has a significant prognostic role in predicting progressive OPGs, thus making it useful for the identification of patients who need close clinical and imaging follow-up.

2-s2.0-85021846668,"Background Placental transfer of ephedrine causes fetal effects when compared with phenylephrine. This study compared their drug effects on neonatal parameters after cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Methods Three-hundred-and-fifty-four women undergoing elective cesarean delivery who needed intravenous vasopressor following spinal anesthesia were randomized into two groups. Group E received boluses of ephedrine 6 mg, and Group P phenylephrine 100 µg, titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure near baseline values. Neonatal heart rates at 10 and 30–45 min of age, oxygen saturation and capillary blood glucose at 30 min, and capillary blood lactate and urine metamphetamine were recorded. Results Neonatal heart rate at 10 min was significantly higher (mean difference 4.0, 95%CI 0.6 to 7.3, P=0.02) in Group E versus Group P, but this was not clinically relevant. There was a linear correlation between neonatal heart rate at 10 min and ephedrine dose in Group E (r2=0.29, 95%CI 0.22, 0.74, p <0.01). The decremental changes in neonatal heart rate at 10 and 30 min were significantly greater in Group E. Urine metamphetamine tests were positive in 19% of 44 neonatal urine samples. Neonatal heart rates at 30 min, oxygen saturation, capillary blood glucose and the incidence of tachycardia, respiratory problems or abnormal glucose, were not significantly different. Conclusions Ephedrine, compared to phenylephrine as a vasopressor during cesarean delivery, was associated with higher neonatal heart rate in the early post-birth period, but without a significant difference in clinical outcomes in uncomplicated pregnancies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Various choices of biodegradable beads are commercially available, but their efficacy has not been proven yet. This study aimed to compare the cleansing efficacy in dirt and sebum removal aspects of three types of exfoliating beads. Methods: The gel scrubs with polyethylene (PE) beads, mannan beads or wax beads, were formulated and evaluated for their stability. The in vivo evaluation was done in 38 healthy volunteers and the skin irritation, efficacy for dirt and sebum removal were measured by Mexameter®, Colorimeter®, and Sebumeter®, respectively. Results: The selected gel scrubs did not cause an irritation in any volunteers. The differences in dirt residues between before and after scrubbing were not statistically significant among three gel scrubs and the similar result was also reported in the sebum removal study. Conclusion: All gel scrubs demonstrated the comparable cleansing efficacy in term of dirt and sebum removal. Thus, mannan beads and wax beads may be replaced non-biodegradable PE beads to achieve the similar cleansing effect. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

2-s2.0-85018936868,"Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a microbial storage biopolymer that can be used in biodegradable plastics. This study investigates the effects of two carbon substrates (acetate and propionate) on PHA production using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in terms of their microbial communities, PHA contents, polymer compositions and structures, and thermal characteristics of the PHA. Sludge was enriched aerobically with acetate or propionate in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) under feast/famine feeding conditions. The sludge enriched with acetate produced a homopolymer of hydroxybutyrate (HB) and accumulated a maximum PHA of 44.78% gPHA/g mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS). In contrast, the sludge enriched with propionate produced a copolymer of HB and hydroxyvalerate (HV) and accumulated a maximum PHA of 12.65% gPHA/gMLSS. The results from the microbial community analysis using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes and class Alphaproteobacteria appeared to be dominant in the system fed with acetate when PHA content was at its maximum. In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were dominant in the system fed with propionate when the PHA content was at its maximum. The PHA produced from acetate also had a higher melting temperature, higher glass transition temperature, and higher crystallinity than did that produced from propionate. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1754–1764, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog"
2-s2.0-85011876423,"This paper describes an approach to design tactile haptic signals that help humans “visualize” an environment through the use of a vibrotactile haptic wristband that has four vibration motors. A human response map to tactile input while sitting was determined experimentally. It shows the zones where humans can classify signals with a high success rate based on minimum Duration of Stimulus (DOS) (“on” periods) and “off” periods of the haptic signals. It was also shown experimentally that a human’s ability to recognize tactile patterns depends on the level of engagement required by the activity. This paper provides an approach to predict a human response map for various activities. The map during sitting is used to design the signals to send information to a human. Two types of signals are developed: sequence stimuli and digital codes. Sequence stimuli create an on/off rhythm for the vibration motors that humans can sense directly without a decoding process. Experiments show that humans can recognize 10 levels of sequence stimuli with a success rate greater than 80%. This class of signals is useful for applications where information must be repeated frequently, e.g., range information sent to a human parking a car. The second class of signals is digital codes, similar to Morse code, where a sequence of long and short motor DOS represents each code. The meaning of the signal is associated with a specific code. From 27 digital codes, experiments showed a successful recognition rate of 78.7%. An application for the digital code method is to pick specific menu items, based on the codes, for fast food restaurants. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London."
2-s2.0-85016593009,"Infrastructure investment is considered to be one of the crucial factors for promoting economic growth. In developing countries such as Thailand, government spending on economic infrastructure is critically important. However, promoting economic growth through infrastructure spending is not without consequences. For instance, a significant amount of carbon emissions was released by the construction and operation of roads in recent years. The aim of this paper is therefore to present a new model of green growth assessment for highway infrastructure that combines economic index with environmental performance of the project. Unlike its contemporary methods, the proposed Green Growth Index (GGI) accounts for the fact that the actual performance of a road project, both economic and environmental ones, may be different from what had been predicted. Accordingly, it may be of use to periodically evaluate the performance of the project in terms of its economic benefits and environmental impacts. A hypothetical road project is first used as a numerical example to illustrate how the proposed method can be applied. Then, a real highway project called Kanchanaphisek Road is then employed as a case study project presented in this paper. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-85014609711,"Dengue hemorrhagic fever is transmitted through a bite by a dengue -infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. It was first reported in the mid -20th century in Thailand, and since then its epidemiology has been of great concern and has spread all across the country. The alarming incidence of dengue posed a serious threat to human health in all major cities of Thailand. This study was aimed at identifying the level of awareness of dengue fever in Thai population knowledge for prevention and control, and most importantly contribution of media in educating masses for dengue control measures. It is longitudinal in nature and was conducted in 25 provinces of Thailand during 2013–2015. Approximately 7772 respondents participated in this study, with the selection of provinces based on considerations like population, prevalence and demography. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect information relevant to study participants’ demographic profile, pre-existing knowledge about dengue fever and its reinforcement through media, and population attitudes toward prevention and control. Over the period of three years, a positive trend was revealed relevant to the contribution of media in educating and reminding the Thai population of dengue, without any uniformity or powerful campaigns. Based on the results drawn from this study, we conclude that despite the measures undertaken to prevent dengue fever, there is insufficient media exposure. An interdisciplinary approach involving the community participation, media, and government is needed to overcome dengue threat in Thailand. © 2017 The Authors"

Three-dimensional dot-like InSb nanostructures are obtained by self-assembled growth at relatively low growth temperatures (250–300 °C) with slow InSb growth rate. Nanostructure base is typically elongated. Facet analysis of the free-standing InSb nanostructure grown at 250 °C shows that each nanostructure has flat top (001) surface while side facets are along <11n> directions. In contrast, InSb nanostructures grown at higher temperature show rather smooth surfaces. Analysis of their size distributions shows that the size inhomogeneity increases with the growth temperature. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy reveals both InSb-related peaks at 181 and 189 cm−1 and GaAs-related peaks at 268 and 293 cm−1.

2-s2.0-85010726105,"A Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Retaining Wall (RCCRW) is one commonly used soil retaining structure in engineering practice. Various optimization techniques to obtain the optimal design of cantilever walls have been proposed, where the three basic geotechnical constraints of overturning, sliding and bearing failures have generally been taken into consideration. However, none of these approaches have considered the geotechnical requirement of slope stability. In this paper, a novel formulation for the optimal design of RCCRWs that considers the more complete requirements of geotechnical stability of overturning, sliding, bearing and slope failures, is described. The objective function of the minimum cost of materials, geotechnical constraints of wall failures (overturning, sliding and bearing) and the structural requirements for steel reinforcements in the wall sections all followed the conventional approaches used in previous works. Using the Ordinary Method of Slices (OMS) with a circular arc failure surface (CAFS), the factor of safety against slope failure (FSOMS) for a RCCRW was implicitly derived. Constraints for ensuring that the minimum FSOMS was higher than the required factor were enforced in the formulation. Design variables were the dimensions of the wall sections, corresponding steel reinforcements and the x-y coordinate of center of the CAFS, where the latter are the additional unknowns in this novel formulation. Computational performance of the proposed optimization method is demonstrated and verified through its application to the optimal design of two examples of RCCRWs. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Our modified and useful approach considers the information about only the number of empty, successful or colliding slots in the previous frame for the tag estimation. Three decision rules were obtained by maximizing the likelihood of success, idle and collision which helps in the reduction of complexity substantially. However, the accuracy of estimation decreases for success-only and idle-only methods while the collision-only method gives a consistent and lower estimate error when the frame sizes and the number of tags increase. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85033580175,"This paper aims to explain relationships between time series by using the Granger causality (GC) concept through autoregressive (AR) models and to assure the model stability. Examining such GC relationship is performed on the model parameters using the Wald test and the model stability is guaranteed by the infinity-norm constraint on the dynamic matrix of the AR process. The proposed formulation is a least-squares estimation with Granger causality and stability constraints which is a convex program with a quadratic objective subject to linear equality and inequality norm constraints. We show by simulations that various typical factors could lead to unstable estimated models when using an unconstrained method. Estimated models from our approach are guaranteed to be stable but the model fitting error could be conservatively increased due to the selected stability condition. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85032508366,"AIM To identify the potential risk factors of cholangiocarcinoma, we determined the characteristics of cholangiocarcinoma patients among 5 different regions of Thailand. METHODS All patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma between 2008 and 2013 were identified using the Nationwide Hospital Admission Data registry (n = 39421). Baseline characteristics, comorbidities and survival were abstracted. RESULTS The annual incidence during the study period was stable in all regions. Most patients lived in the Northeast (62.8%), followed by the North (16.9%), Central (12.3%), Bangkok (5.4%), and South (n = 2.6%) regions (p < 0.0001). Significantly more cholangiocarcinoma patients had diabetes, cirrhosis, and chronic viral hepatitis B/C infection than noncholangiocarcinoma participants (diabetes: 11.42% vs 5.28%; cirrhosis: 4.81% vs 0.92%; hepatitis B: 0.74% vs 0.12%; and hepatitis C: 0.50% vs 0.10%, p < 0.0001 for all, respectively). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 81.7%, with a stable trend over time. CONCLUSION Diabetes and chronic liver diseases may be associated with cholangiocarcinoma in the Thai population. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The measurement is based on 13 TeV proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb-1, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet transverse momentum pT, jet rapidity, the scalar pT sum of the jets, and angular correlations between the muon and each jet for different jet multiplicities. The measured cross sections are in agreement with predictions that include multileg leading-order (LO) and next-to-LO matrix element calculations interfaced with parton showers, as well as a next-to-next-to-LO calculation for the W boson and one jet production. © 2017 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

2-s2.0-85020897462,"Chitosan (CTS) combined with spermidine (SPD) was applied as fruit coating for ‘Nam Dok Mai’ mango (Mangifera indica L.) compared with CTS and SPD treatments after harvest and stored at 25 ± 2 °C for 9 days. Influence of all treatments on anthracnose disease and qualities of mango fruit was investigated after inoculation fruit with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Inoculated fruit coated with 1% CTS combined with 0.1 ppm SPD exhibited the smallest area of lesion development (0–1 cm); while non-coating inoculated fruit presented the most severe fungal decay (4–5 cm). Furthermore, inoculated fruit coated with 1% CTS combined with 0.1 ppm SPD showed higher plant defense mechanisms than control and other treated fruits. These phenomena were represented by the production of high levels of H2O2 and phenolic compounds during storage and the induction of defense enzyme activities including chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase and peroxidase whereas fruit treated with only CMS or SPD expressed lower effect on induction of plant defense mechanisms. Therefore, synergistic effect of chitosan and spermidine combination can increase the ability to inhibit anthracnose disease development on ‘Nam Dok Mai’ mango fruit. Delayed mango fruit softening by 1% CTS combined with 0.1 ppm SPD was in correlation with reduced soluble pectin content during ripening stage. The results obtained suggested that 1% CTS combined with 0.1 ppm SPD had potential to improve firmness and delay deterioration processes of ‘Nam Dok Mai’ mango fruit after harvest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85029814049,"A thermally-coupled monolithic membrane reformer (TMMR) is a heat and membrane integrated reformer for portable hydrogen production. This study simulates the TMMR using Aspen Plus software to find the appropriate monolith design and operation parameters to achieve optimal energy efficiency and hydrogen production within a small volume reactor. Different types of fuels, i.e. methane, methanol and ethanol, and various operating conditions, including molar flow rate of fuel (0.01–0.05 mol/s for combustion and 0.1–0.5 mol/s for reforming) and reforming pressure (3–5 atm), were investigated via thermodynamic equilibrium analysis. When methanol and ethanol were used as feedstocks, a reverse water-gas-shift reaction occurred, resulting in a decrease of energy efficiency. While using methane as a feedstock with a specific molar flow rate of 0.03 mol/s for the combustion reaction, 0.30 mol/s for the reforming reaction, and a reforming pressure of 4 atm, significant improvement of efficiency was observed. At the same time, the performance of the TMMR design was simulated based on the surface area of different sizes and configurations of monolith, i.e. parallel and checked arrangements, by using a kinetic-based model approach. The highest efficiency achieved was from the checked arrangement of monolith with 200 cpsi of cell density, 150 mm of diameter and length, and exchange area of around 1.5 m2. This design requires a small space of only 2.65 L in volume to provide 129 kW of hydrogen energy production with 44.0% efficiency.

The WAC hybrid adhesive was formulated with a new class of porous clay heterostructure (PCH), which was modified with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (as a coupling agent) to promote chemical bonding with the acrylic matrix to form a methacrylate-functionalized PCH (MPCH). The WAC hybrid adhesive was based on copolymers (2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate, 2-(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate, styrene and acrylic acid) with varying amounts of MPCH. The scanning electron microscopy micrographs revealed the presence of a well dispersed MPCH distributed throughout the matrix. The optimal adhesive performance, in terms of the 180° peel strength of bonded joints, of 140.2 N/m was achieved using 1.5 wt% of MPCH, while the thermal stability of the adhesives was improved with increasing MPCH loading levels. © Copyright Materials Research Society 2017."
2-s2.0-85030660970,"Background Medically refractory resting tremor is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In our pilot study, modulation of peripheral reflex mechanism by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) temporarily suppressed tremor. Objectives To investigate the efficacy of EMS, delivered using Tremor's glove, as a treatment of resting hand tremor. Patients and methods Thirty PD patients with medically refractory resting tremor were randomly allocated to a Tremor's glove group (n = 15) or a sham glove group (n = 15). Gloves were placed on the most tremulous hand for 30 min per testing session. Demographics, clinical rating scales, and tremor parameters (RMS of angular velocity and angular displacement, peak magnitude, and frequency) were assessed before and during stimulation. Correlations with validated clinical rating scales were performed. Results There were no statistically significant differences between groups in demographics, rating scales, or tremor parameters. During stimulation, significant reduction in RMS angular velocity (as percentage) in every axis and peak magnitude in axis (x-, y-) and UPDRS tremor score, were found with Tremor's glove compared to the sham groups (p < 0.05, each). Significant moderate correlations were observed between a percentage reduction of RMS angular velocity in every axis and UPDRS tremor scores. Mean duration of tremor reduction after stimulation was 107.78 ± 104.15 s. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusion In this study, EMS-based Tremor's glove was effective in suppressing resting hand tremor in PD patients. Tremor's glove is light-weight with a good safety profile, making it a future potential therapeutic option for PD patients with medically refractory tremor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85033609464,"Results are presented from a search for production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) where one boson decays to a pair of b quarks and the other to a τ lepton pair. This work is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at s=8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.3 fb-1. Resonant and nonresonant modes of HH production have been probed and no significant excess relative to the background-only hypotheses has been found in either mode. Upper limits on cross sections of the two HH production modes have been set. The results have been combined with previously published searches at s=8 TeV, in decay modes to two photons and two b quarks, as well as to four b quarks, which also show no evidence for a signal. Limits from the combination have been set on resonant HH production by an unknown particle X in the mass range mX=300 GeV to mX=1000 GeV. For resonant production of spin 0 (spin 2) particles, the observed 95% CL upper limit is 1.13 pb (1.09 pb) at mX=300 GeV and to 21 fb (18 fb) at mX=1000 GeV. For nonresonant HH production, a limit of 43 times the rate predicted by the standard model has been set. © 2017 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

In this work, effects of the multiple hit NRT (m>1 NRT) and the long surface diffusion length NRT (ℓ>1 NRT) on the surface morphologies and characteristics of S and Q are studied. In the early growth time, plots of S and Q versus time of the m>1 morphologies show pronounced oscillation indicating the layer by layer growth. Our results show that S=0 and Q<0 at every half layer while S=0 and Q>0 at every complete layer. The results are confirmed by the same plots of the results from the Das Sarma–Tamborenea (DT) model. The ℓ>1 LC model, on the other hand, has no evidence of the layer by layer growth mode due to the rapidly damped oscillation of S and Q. In the steady state, the m>1 and ℓ>1 NRTs affect weakly on the values of S and Q and the mounded morphologies of the film. This lead to the evidence of universality of S and Q in the steady state of the LC models with various m and ℓ. The finite size effect on the values of S and Q is found to be very weak in the LC model. By extrapolating to L→∞, we obtain SL→∞≈0.05 and QL→∞≈−0.62 which are in agreement with the NRTs results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85015830542,"Chemical absorption using reactive amines for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is characterized by absorption heat, heat of desorption and heat duty for regeneration (Qreg, kJ/mol CO2). This study experimentally investigated the heat duty of tri–solvent blends containing AMP–PZ–MEA and the individual contribution of desorption heat, sensible heat and heat of vaporization to heat duty. The experimental conditions for absorption were 15 v/v% CO2 at 40 °C and atmospheric pressure while desorption was carried out 90 °C for loaded amine also at atmospheric pressure. The heat of desorption was experimentally determined using the specific heat capacity (kJ/kg °C) difference between the CO2 free and CO2 saturated amine solutions at the stated absorption conditions. Results showed that the heat duty of all the tri–solvent blends was significantly lower than that of the standard 5 kmol/m3 MEA. Interestingly, the AMP–PZ–MEA tri–solvent blends exhibited only slightly lower heats of absorption when compared to MEA; however, they also showed significantly lower sensible heat and slightly lower heat of vaporization. Consequently, the tri–solvent blends exhibited significantly lower heat duties than the standard 5 kmol/m3 MEA. In addition, a model analogous to a power law kinetic model was developed and used to predict the specific heat capacity of the AMP–PZ–MEA tri–solvent blends. The model accurately predicted the experimental results with an AAD of 0.59%. The overall results highlight the potential of using AMP–PZ–MEA blends for CO2 capture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85014078485,"The effect of the side chain structure and the number of hydroxyl groups in primary, secondary and tertiary amines on CO2 absorption and desorption kinetics, equilibrium loading, heat duty, cyclic capacity, heat of absorption and pKa were studied and used to develop rational criteria for selecting components to formulate an optimum amine blend. Based on the criteria, amines that had a combination of high absorption parameter and high desorption parameter were selected. Their mixing ratios and concentrations were varied to obtain the best overall performance. The results of this study showed that, in comparison with their straight-chain analogues, steric hindrance present in branched-chain alkanolamines resulted in much faster desorption rate, higher solubility CO2 and cyclic capacity, and much lower heat duty for solvent regeneration, but just a slight decrease in CO2 absorption rate. The developed criteria resulted in formulating an excellent bi-solvent aqueous amine blend (comprising 2 M BEA + 2 M AMP), which was shown to have an outstanding desorption characteristics/heat duty as well as very good absorption characteristics. In addition, this work developed a new non-trial-and-error procedure to determine the heat of CO2 absorption based on Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. Furthermore, this work showed that the CO2 absorption rate and the heat of CO2 absorption may not necessarily be proportional to the heat of absorption and heat duty, respectively. Both these relations were shown to be strong functions of the amine structure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The pp(Pb-Pb) data set used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 28.0 pb-1 (351 μb-1). The measurement is performed in the B± meson transverse momentum range of 7 to 50 GeV/c, in the rapidity interval |y|<2.4. In this kinematic range, a strong suppression of the production cross section by about a factor of 2 is observed in the Pb-Pb system in comparison to the expectation from pp reference data.

2-s2.0-85031087734,"Background: Previous studies have found that polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1(XRCC1) and environmental factors are both associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer, but no study has reported on the potential additive effect of these factors among Thai people. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the risk of stomach cancer from XRCC1 gene polymorphisms was modified by environmental factors in the Thai population. Methods: Hospital-based matched case-control study data were collected from 101 new stomach cancer cases and 202 controls, which were recruited from2002 to 2006 and were matched for gender and age. Genotype analysis was performed using real-time PCR-HRM. The data were analysed by the chi-square test and conditional logistic regression. Results: The Arg/Arg homozygote polymorphism of the XRCC1 gene was associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer in the Thai population (OR adj, 3.7; 95%CI, 1.30-10.72) compared with Gln/Gln homozygosity. The effect of the XRCC1gene on the risk of stomach cancer was modified by both a high intake of vegetable oils and salt (p = 0.036 and p = 0.014), particularly for the Arg/Arg homozygous genotype. There were, however, no additive effects on the risk of stomach cancer between variants of the XRCC1gene and smoking,alcohol or pork oil consumption. Conclusions: The effect of the XRCC1 gene homozygosity, particularly Arg/Arg, on the risk for stomach cancer was elevated by a high intake of vegetable oils and salt. © 2017 The Author(s)."

Transabdominal measurement of the whole foetal adrenal gland and adrenal foetal zone were added to the routine biometric measurements at 16–24weeks of gestation of singleton low-risk pregnancies. A total of 189 measurements were used for analysis. A linear correlation was observed between gestational age and the length, width and depth of the whole foetal adrenal gland at 16–24weeks of gestation. A linear correlation was also found between gestational age and the length, width and depth of the foetal zone at 16–24weeks of gestation. This study shows the linear growth of the foetal adrenal gland and foetal zone from 16–24weeks of gestation. These reference values may be helpful in detecting abnormal growth of foetal adrenal gland or any abnormalities of the foetal adrenal gland.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject: Foetal adrenal glands play a pivotal role, mainly through steroidogenesis, in the regulation of the intrauterine homeostasis, and in foetal development and maturation. There is evidence to support that the foetus may be in control of the timing of its own birth by activating its hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to increase the production of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate to predominately induce the enlargement of the central foetal zone. What the results of this study add: This study shows the nomograms of the foetal adrenal gland and foetal zone from 16–24 weeks of gestation and the linear growth of the foetal adrenal gland and foetal zone from 16–24 weeks of gestation.

2-s2.0-85071707398,"Background and Aim: Currently available staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) are not applicable to patients with unresectable stage. A new clinical staging system for perihilar CCA (pCCA) subtype has been recently developed in a US cohort, with a good performance in predicting survival of all pCCA patients. We aimed to determine outcomes of pCCA patients and evaluate predictive performance of this staging system in an Asian population. Methods: All 141 patients diagnosed with pCCA between 2003 and 2012 were identified. Clinical information was retrospectively abstracted. Patients were classified into four stages based on the new staging system. Survival predictors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Of the 141 pCCA patients, 38 (27%), 101 (72%), and 2 (1%) received resection, palliative biliary drainage ± chemotherapy, and best supportive care, respectively. Survival predictors included resectable disease, tumor size, distant metastasis, and cancer antigen 19-9 ≥ 1000 U/mL. When classified by clinical stages, 13, 4, 99, and 25 patients were in stages I, II, III, and IV, with median survivals of 18.4, 7.3, 6.3, and 2.6 months; and hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.0 (reference), 1.7 (0.5–5.5), 3.2 (1.5–6.7), and 10.8 (4.6–25.0), respectively. Conclusion: The clinical staging system has a limited performance in differentiating stage II pCCA patients from stage III patients in the Thai cohort. This can be due to differences in patient characteristics and treatment modalities between the Asian and White pCCA populations. However, the median survivals of patients with other stages are significantly different. © 2017 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85059788538,"InSb has been considered as a promising material for spintronic applications owing to its pronounced spin effects as a result of large intrinsic electronic g-factor. In addition, embedding InSb quantum nanostructures in a GaAs matrix could create type-II band alignment, where radiation lifetimes are longer than those of the typical type-I systems. Such characteristics are promising for memory devices and infrared photonic applications. The growth of InSb/GaAs quantum nanostructures by strain driven mechanism using molecular beam epitaxy with low growth temperature, slow growth rate, Sb soaking process prior to In deposition, and small amount of In deposition typically creates a mixture of twin and single nano-stripe structures with truncated pyramid shape. In this work, we further investigate the growth mechanism of such twin InSb/GaAs nano-stripes by controlling the growth conditions, consisting of nanostructure growth duration and growth temperature. When the growth temperature is kept to less than 300°C and In deposition is set to only a few monolayers, we found that 25-40% of formed nanostructures are twin InSb/GaAs nano-stripes. However, when the In deposition is stopped immediately after the spotty reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns are observed, the ratio of twin nano-stripes to single ones is increased to 50-60%. We therefore describe the growth mechanism of twin nano-stripes as the early state of single nano-stripe formation, where the twin nano-stripes are initially formed during the first monolayer of InSb formation as a result of large lattice mismatch of 14.6%. When In deposition is increased to a few monolayers, the gap between twin nano-stripes is filled up and consequently forms the single nano-stripes instead. With this particular twin nano-stripe growth mechanism, the preservation of high ratio of twin nano-stripe formation can be expected by further reducing the growth temperature, i.e. less than 260°C. These twin nano-stripes may find applications in the fields of spintronics and novel interference nano-devices. © 2017 Materials Research Society."
2-s2.0-85047802198,"This study aimed to synthesize low viscosity oligolactide acrylates for UV-curable inks from oligolactide diols. Firstly, low molecular weight oligolactide diols were prepared by ring opening reaction of L-lactide with diols. Oligolactide acrylates were then synthesized by functionalizing the oligolactide diols with acrylic acid. In this study, three diol ring openers having short and long alkyl chain length were used to investigate the effects of the amount and type of diols on the properties of the oligolactide acrylates. The obtained oligomers were characterized, and the viscosities of oligolactide acrylates were measured. Results showed that oligolactide acrylates were successfully synthesized in all cases of ring openers, as confirmed by 1 H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). An increase in the alkyl chain length of the ring openers resulted in oligomers with lower viscosity and a decrease in T g . Following that, the obtained oligolactide acrylates were employed for the formulation of UV-curable screen printing inks and their properties were investigated. Results showed that the inks formulated from oligomers with lower molecular weight exhibited better ink flow. Additionally, all ink films cured by UV radiation were very flexible with excellent adhesion, high impact resistance, and excellent water resistance. © 2017 by the authors."

Yet the problem persists. The case study method was used to examine the fundamental cause of the liver fluke infection problem. Evidence shows that the liver fluke–infected population does not care about living a long life. For them, suffering and death are simply a part of life, and expected. Thus, the cause(s) leading to death is not important. They believe morally bad actions, and predetermined fate associated with kamma in Buddhism, play a big role whether or not one is infected with the liver fluke. Health interventions may be made more effective if they take into account the liver fluke–infected population’s worldviews about ethics, morality, life, and death. We researchers should not feel concerned only about medically determined causes of death. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-85035804538,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 are responsible for at least 90% of the cases, which are transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner or are de novo events. We identified a Thai boy with OI whose parents were first cousins. Because the proband was the product of a consanguineous marriage, we hypothesized that he might be homozygous for a mutation in a known gene causing a recessive form of OI. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we did not find any pathogenic mutations in any known gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of OI. Instead, we identified a COL1A1 frameshift mutation, c.1290delG (p.Gly431Valfs*110) in heterozygosis. By Sanger sequencing, the mutation was confirmed in the proband, and not detected in his parents, indicating that it was a de novo mutation. These findings had implication for genetic counseling. In conclusion, we expanded the mutational spectrum of COL1A1 and provided another example of a de novo pathogenic mutation in heterozygosis in a patient born to consanguineous parents. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

2-s2.0-85033462889,"Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars have been recently used to reinforce concrete members in flexure due to their high tensile strength and especially in corrosive environments to improve the durability of concrete structures. However, FRPs have a low modulus of elasticity and a linear elastic behavior up to rupture, thus reinforced concrete (RC) components with such materials would exhibit a less ductility in comparison with steel reinforcement at the similar members. There were several studies showed the behavior of concrete beams with the hybrid combination of steel and FRP longitudinal reinforcement by adopting the experimental and numerical programs. The current study presents a numerical and analytical investigation based on the data of previous researches. Three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of beams by using ANSYS are built and investigated. In addition, this study also discusses on the design methods for hybrid FRP-steel beams in terms of ultimate moment capacity, load-deflection response, crack width, and ductility. The effects of the reinforcement ratio, concrete compressive strength, arrangement of reinforcement, and the length of FRP bars on the mechanical performance of hybrid beams are considered as a parametric study by means of FE method. The results obtained from this study are compared and verified with the experimental and numerical data of the literature. This study provides insight into the mechanical performances of hybrid FRP-steel RC beams, builds the reliable FE models which can be used to predict the structural behavior of hybrid RC beams, offers a rational design method together with an useful database to evaluate the ductility for concrete beams with the combination of FRP and steel reinforcement, and motivates the further development in the future research by applying parametric study.

2-s2.0-85036521341,"Templestay, the cultural experience program accommodating foreign and domestic visitors to Korean Buddhist temples, is one of the most successful and popular heritage tourism products of contemporary South Korea. Noting the interwoven relationship between Korean Buddhism, the state's heritage policies, spiritual tourism, contemporary brand culture, and new digital media, this research explores how the branding practices and narrative of Templestay in digital spaces newly shape the presence of Korean Buddhism in the contemporary social world that is inevitably imagined and constantly (re)mediated. Despite Templestay's efforts to anchor Korean Buddhism in the locations of tradition, spirituality, the sacred, the self, and authenticity in the contexts of late-modernity and globalization, this research finds, the public presence of Korean Buddhism, mediated by digital media and branding practice, constantly oscillates between the secular and the sacred, the global and the local, modernity and tradition, tourism and spirituality, the market and the self, and commodity and authenticity. It is the dilemma of Korean Buddhism that the spontaneous employment of digital media and branding practices for sustaining and fixing its public presence in this highly mediated and networked social world, inevitably generates the ambivalence and in-betweenness of the mediated presence of Korean Buddhism."

At present, an individual genotyping of Human Papillomavirus can provide essential information for an improvement of diagnosis and medical treatment to infected patients. Objective: For this purpose, our paper focuses on predicting the significant Human Papillomavirus genotypes mainly associated with cervical cancers. Method: In this experiment, partial coding sequences of genotypes were transformed into coordinates in chaos game representations, and they were subsequently partitioned into 8×8 equal sub-regions. Probabilities of distribution in sub-regions were extracted in forms of tri-nucleotide frequencies. Then, two-fold cross validation technique was employed for separating training and testing sets. For each fold, a feature selection by RReliefF algorithm was conducted for selecting significant features, followed by predicting the corresponding genotypes by fuzzy k-nearest neighbor technique. Results: The experimental results showed that our proposed method can achieve higher performance than two related methods, while RReliefF algorithm can successfully reduce all of 64 extracted features into 29 significant features. Additionally, it also found that our experimental results are significantly different from those of the method of Nair et al., in almost all genotypes. Conclusion: Therefore, the algorithm based on chaos game representation and fuzzy k-nearest neighbor technique can efficiently predict Human Papillomavirus genotypes. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."
2-s2.0-85032703898,"Background: Colon cancer is a major health problem worldwide. Available treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and anticancer drugs are limited due to stage of cancer, side effects and altered biodistribution. The use of peptides extracted from natural products has appeared as a potential therapy. Gloriosa superba is known to contain colchicine and other alkaloids with anticancer activity. However, these peptides contained within the extracts have not been studied. This study, therefore, focuses on an investigation of anti–colon cancer activity from a partially purified protein hydrolysate of G superba rhizome. Methods: Dried G superba rhizome was extracted using 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate and digested with pepsin. The protein hydrolysates with molecular weight lesser than 3 kDa were collected and subjected for cell viability assay. Then, the partial purification of the protein hydrolysate was performed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions containing anticancer peptides were investigated, and their effects on apoptosis and protein expression using apoptosis test and Western blot, respectively. Results: Partially purified peptides of G superba rhizome demonstrated anticolon activity in SW620 cells by inducing apoptosis through upregulation of p53 and downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).

2-s2.0-85032856887,"In this study, the seismicity rate changes that can represent an earthquake precursor were investigated along the Sagaing Fault Zone (SFZ), Central Myanmar, using the Z value technique. After statistical improvement of the existing seismicity data (the instrumental earthquake records) by removal of the foreshocks and aftershocks and man-made seismicity changes and standardization of the reported magnitude scales, 3574 earthquake events with a Mw ≥ 4.2 reported during 1977–2015 were found to directly represent the seismotectonic activities of the SFZ. To find the characteristic parameters specifically suitable for the SFZ, seven known events of Mw ≥ 6.0 earthquakes were recognized and used for retrospective tests. As a result, utilizing the conditions of 25 fixed earthquake events considered (N) and a 2-year time window (Tw), a significantly high Z value was found to precede most of the Mw ≥ 6.0 earthquakes. Therefore, to evaluate the prospective areas of upcoming earthquakes, these conditions (N = 25 and Tw = 2) were applied with the most up-to-date seismicity data of 2010–2015.

Chicken feather meal is a rich source of amino acids, which have been linked with tyrosinase inhibition activity. This study investigated the tyrosinase inhibitory properties of protein hydrolysates prepared from chicken feather meal. Protein hydrolysates prepared by pepsin-pancreatin with MW <3 kDa exhibited strong tyrosinase inhibition activity for both monophenolase (IC50 5.780 ± 0.188 µg/mL) and diphenolase activities (IC50 0.040 ± 0.024 µg/mL) in a cell-free mushroom tyrosinase system. These samples were uncompetitive inhibitors with Ki values of 18.149 and 27.189 µg/mL in monophenolase and diphenolase activities, respectively. A cell culture model showed that this hydrolysate had the strongest inhibition on the viability of B16F10 cells (IC50 1.124 ± 0.288 µg/mL) and 0.210 µg/mL of the sample exhibited inhibition of tyrosinase activity by 50.493% and melanin synthesis by 14.680% compared to the control. © 2017, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology and Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

To our knowledge, this is the first report presenting the evidence that mycosporine-like amino acid confers salt tolerance on E. coli. Intracellular M2G content in the transformed E. coli cells were varied depending on NaCl concentration with maximum level at 0.75 M. Moreover, intracellular M2G level was affected by a supply of glycine with maximum level at 5 mM. In conclusion, we found that transformed E. coli cells could produce 205 μg of M2G/g fresh weight of cells under the best effective growth condition in this study. Thus, the results obtained here offer the potential for the bioproduction of mycosporine-like amino acids using the genetically engineered E. coli cells."
2-s2.0-85032260463,"The following study focuses on the reduction of the required amounts of MAO after the addition of Ti into the prepared spherical silica particle (SSP) to obtain TiSSP as a support of the bis(phenoxy–imine) Ti-based catalyst used for ethylene polymerization. The ethylene polymerization was carried out via the introduction of SSP and TiSSP-supported MAO with various MAO contents, followed by adding the bis(phenoxy–imine) Ti-based catalyst. The characteristics of SSP and Ti-modified SSP were determined by XRD, BET, FTIR, and NH3-TPD. There was evidence of the presence of Ti–O–Si bond and the increase of acidity with the introduction of Ti into SSP. Interestingly, the increased acidity on the surface of TiSSP composites was found to be the crucial characteristic, which played an important role on the reduction of the required amounts of MAO. It is suggested that the modification of SSP with Ti is able to decrease (by ca. 22%) the consumption of the required amounts of MAO for polymerization. In other words, the lower ratio of MAO to catalyst for TiSSP was observed for the identical value of activity obtained from SSP. The produced polymers were thoroughly identified by DSC and SEM techniques. All polyethylenes obtained using TiSSP exhibited higher crystallinity than those obtained from SSP support. Finally, employing the TiSSP-supported bis(phenoxy–imine), Ti-based catalyst leads to producing the polymer with lamellar structure that seemed to be corresponding to the crystalline structure as was confirmed by DSC results. © 2017, Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute."
2-s2.0-85034450095,"A search for dark matter is performed looking for events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom quarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1. Results are interpreted in the context of a Z′-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended by a U(1)Z ′ group, with a new massive Z′ gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z′ decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like scalar Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the mZ ′ - mA phase space. For example, the observed data exclude the Z′ mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for Z′ coupling strength gZ ′ = 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles gχ = 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan β = 1, and mA = 300 GeV.

Consequently, P. parkeae and other prasinophytes illuminate early-evolved Viridiplantae traits likely fundamental in the systems biology of green algae and land plants. Cellular structure and organellar genomes of P. parkeae are now well understood, and transcriptomic sequence data are also publically available for one strain of this species, but corresponding nuclear genomic sequence data are lacking. For this reason, we obtained shotgun genomic sequence and assembled a draft nuclear genome for P. parkeaeNIES254 to use along with existing transcriptomic sequence to focus on carbohydrate-active enzymes. We found that the P. parkeae nuclear genome encodes carbohydrate-active protein families similar to those previously observed for other prasinophytes, green algae, and early-diverging embryophytes for which full nuclear genomic sequence is publically available. Sequences homologous to genes related to biosynthesis of starch and cell wall carbohydrates were identified in the P. parkeae genome, indicating molecular traits common to Viridiplantae. For example, the P. parkeae genome includes sequences clustering with bacterial genes that encode cellulose synthases (Bcs), including regions coding for domains common to bacterial and plant cellulose synthases; these new sequences were incorporated into phylogenies aimed at illuminating the evolutionary history of cellulose production by Viridiplantae.

2-s2.0-85031294654,"In the present work, an average membrane wetting ratio at high operating pressure of hollow fiber polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane contactors was estimated analytically based on log-normal distribution function. The membrane characteristics, liquid velocity, operating pressure were also considered for the calculation. The simulations were validated with experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the calculated average membrane wetting at high pressure. At the operating pressure of 1 bar, dry modes are observed for both PVDF and PTFE. While the results of PTFE correspond with the dry mode, the partially wetted mode well predicts the results of PVDF at high operating pressure. The increases of liquid velocity and operating pressure show the higher membrane wetting due to the influences of increasing pressure drop in membrane module and lower surface tension of CO2-dissolved water at high operating pressure. Moreover, PTFE provides lower average membrane wetting compared with PVDF since the average membrane wetting ratio from the calculation occurs at higher trans-membrane pressure at the outlet liquid (>1 bar) which can be possible to maintain the dry mode including during the start-up of the process for the highest absorption performance using PTFE. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
2-s2.0-85031803874,"Purpose: Careful decontamination and sterilization of reusable flexible ureteroscopes used in ureterorenoscopy cases prevent the spread of infectious pathogens to patients and technicians. However, inefficient reprocessing and unavailability of ureteroscopes sent out for repair can contribute to expensive operating room (OR) delays. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was applied to describe the time and costs involved in reprocessing. Materials and Methods: Direct observation and timing were performed for all steps in reprocessing of reusable flexible ureteroscopes following operative procedures. Estimated times needed for each step by which damaged ureteroscopes identified during reprocessing are sent for repair were characterized through interviews with purchasing analyst staff. Process maps were created for reprocessing and repair detailing individual step times and their variances. Cost data for labor and disposables used were applied to calculate per minute and average step costs. Results: Ten ureteroscopes were followed through reprocessing. Process mapping for ureteroscope reprocessing averaged 229.0 ± 74.4 minutes, whereas sending a ureteroscope for repair required an estimated 143 minutes per repair. Most steps demonstrated low variance between timed observations. Ureteroscope drying was the longest and highest variance step at 126.5 ± 55.7 minutes and was highly dependent on manual air flushing through the ureteroscope working channel and ureteroscope positioning in the drying cabinet. Total costs for reprocessing totaled $96.13 per episode, including the cost of labor and disposable items. Conclusions: Utilizing TDABC delineates the full spectrum of costs associated with ureteroscope reprocessing and identifies areas for process improvement to drive value-based care. At our institution, ureteroscope drying was one clearly identified target area. Implementing training in ureteroscope drying technique could save up to 2 hours per reprocessing event potentially preventing expensive OR delays. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017."

Material and Method: A retrospective study was performed on AGW patients between January 2004 and December 2014. Laparotomy was done in patients with 1) shock and/or peritonitis, 2) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and 3) suspected peritoneal penetration (PP), with an exception of isolated right upper quadrant/right thoracoabdominal (RUQ/RTA) gunshot wound. SNOM was attempted in 1) patients with no PP (tangential AGW), and 2) stable patients with RUQ/RTA gunshot wound. Outcomes in terms of mortality and non-therapeutic laparotomy rate were analyzed. Stepwise logistic regression of the emergency department parameters was performed to identify predictors for therapeutic laparotomy. Results: Eighty AGW patients were included in the present study. Forty-seven patients underwent immediate operation (32 shock/peritonitis, one rectal bleeding, and 14 PP), 46 had a therapeutic laparotomy. SNOM was attempted in 28 tangential AGW patients (all successful), four stable RUQ/RTA gunshot wound patients (one failure due to continued bleeding), and one patient with delayed presentation (successful). Overall, a successful SNOM was carried out in 32 patients (40%), the non-therapeutic laparotomy rate was 2%, and the mortality rate was 8%. The only predictor for therapeutic laparotomy identified in the present study was a positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) result (odds ratio 51.2, 95% CI 6.3 to 414.9, p<0.001). Conclusion: SNOM can be performed safely in patients with tangential AGW and stable isolated RUQ/RTA gunshot wound patients. FAST may be helpful in predicting a therapeutic laparotomy in AGW patients. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85032667090,"A search for new phenomena is performed using events with jets and significant transverse momentum imbalance, as inferred through the MT 2 variable. The results are based on a sample of proton–proton collisions collected in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. No excess event yield is observed above the predicted standard model background, and the results are interpreted as exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the masses of predicted particles in a variety of simplified models of R-parity conserving supersymmetry. Depending on the details of the model, 95% confidence level lower limits on the gluino (light-flavor squark) masses are placed up to 2025 (1550)GeV. Mass limits as high as 1070 (1175)GeV are set on the masses of top (bottom) squarks. Information is provided to enable re-interpretation of these results, including model-independent limits on the number of non-standard model events for a set of simplified, inclusive search regions. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."
2-s2.0-85031097472,"Objectives This study sought to determine the prevalence, correlates, and impact on cardiac mortality of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Background Current heart failure guidelines place little emphasis on RV assessment due to limited available data on determinants of RV function, mechanisms leading to its failure, and relation to outcomes. Methods We prospectively studied 423 patients with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The pre-specified study endpoint was cardiac mortality. In 100 patients, right heart catheterization was performed as clinically indicated. Results During a median follow-up time of 6.2 years (interquartile range: 2.9 to 7.6 years), 101 patients (24%) died of cardiac causes. CMR right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was a strong independent predictor of cardiac mortality after adjustment for age, heart failure–functional class, blood pressure, heart rate, serum sodium, serum creatinine, myocardial scar, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with the lowest quintile of RVEF had a nearly 5-fold higher cardiac mortality risk than did patients with the highest quintile (hazard ratio: 4.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.43 to 9.02; p < 0.0001). RVEF was positively correlated with LVEF (r = 0.60; p < 0.0001), and inversely correlated with right atrial pressure (r = −0.32; p = 0.001), pulmonary artery pressure (r = −0.34; p = 0.0005), transpulmonary gradient (r = −0.28; p = 0.006) but not with pulmonary wedge pressure (r = −0.15; p = 0.13). In multivariable logistic regression analysis of CMR, clinical, and hemodynamic data the strongest predictors of right ventricular dysfunction were LVEF (odds ratio [OR]: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.92; p < 0.0001), transpulmonary gradient (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.32; p = 0.0003), and systolic blood pressure (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.99; p = 0.02). Conclusions CMR assessment of RVEF provides important prognostic information independent of established risk factors and LVEF in heart failure patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular dysfunction is strongly associated with both indices of intrinsic myocardial contractility and increased afterload from pulmonary vascular dysfunction. © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation"

The gauged supergravity has a non-semisimple SO(3) ⋉ (T3, T^ 3) gauge group and can be obtained from a consistent truncation of 11-dimensional supergravity on a tri-sasakian manifold. The maximally symmetric vacua contain AdS 4 geometries with N= 1 , 3 supersymmetry corresponding to N= 1 and N= 3 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in three dimensions. We find supersymmetric solutions of the form AdS 2× Σ 2 preserving two supercharges. These solutions describe twisted compactifications of the dual N= 1 and N= 3 SCFTs and should arise as near horizon geometries of dyonic black holes in asymptotically AdS 4 space-time. Most solutions have hyperbolic horizons although some of them exhibit spherical horizons. These provide a new class of AdS 2× Σ 2 geometries with known M-theory origin. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85030672945,"We demonstrate how the EVT-based signalling approach for currency crises can be applied to an individual country with a small sample size. Using Thai historical data, first, we study the tail characteristics of the distributions of two Thai baht instability measures and 21 economic fundamentals. Then, we test asymptotic dependence between the currency instability measures and lagged economic fundamentals. Empirically, we find that the distributions of both currency instability measures and economic variables are heavy tailed. Assuming a normal distribution for the variables tends to underestimate the probability of extreme events. Furthermore, most of the economic variables which are usually used as signalling indicators for currency crises are asymptotically independent of the currency instability measures. Signals issued by these variables are thus not reliable. Nevertheless, the non-parametric EVT approach facilitates the selection of economic indicators with credible signals and high crisis prediction success. © 2015 Board of Trustees of the Bulletin of Economic Research and John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
2-s2.0-85030689809,"The Austroasiatic speaking people are regarded as the native inhabitants in Thailand, predating the coming of Kra-Dai-speaking groups from Southwestern China. Two of the largest Austroasiatic speaking groups in Northeastern Thailand are the Northern Khmer and the Kuy. Previous genetic surveys of these two ethnic groups mostly used mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms, therefore, the present study intended to utilize the variability of autosomal microsatellites to deeply investigate the genetic structure of the Northern Khmer and the Kuy. Thirty-one and forty-seven samples of unrelated Northern Khmer and Kuy, respectively, were genotyped for 15 microsatellites. Distance based and model based clustering methods were employed to elucidate the evolutionary relationship between the studied populations and ten other linguistically and geographically diverse comparable populations in Thailand. Analysis of Molecular Variance and Factorial Correspondence Analysis revealed a genetic heterogeneity in Austroasiatic populations but an opposite trend was observed in the genetically homogeneous Kra-Dai populations. STRUCTURE result shows that the Northern Khmer contributes approximately 31% of their genes to the gene pool of their neighbor, Lao Isan, indicating a genetic exchange among them. The extreme genetic divergence of the Kuy from other populations seems to be much higher than the Northern Khmer. A genetic admixture of the Northern Khmer and with their neighboring Lao Isan was detected and this is consistent with archaeological evidence. © 2017, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85030679017,"We describe here the synthesis of aqueous dispersed cationic polymer coated magnetite nanoparticles. The cationic polymer was synthesized by two-steps reaction: the ring-opening reaction of commercial poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAO) with 2- (2-aminoethoxy)ethanol and subsequently grafting with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride to obtain modified poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (MPMAO). The characterization of MPMAO was determined by ATR-FTIR, 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. By emulsion evaporation method, the magnetite nanoparticles prepared by the chemical co-precipitation were encapsulated with MPMAO to form modified poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) coated magnetite nanoparticles (MPMAO-Fe3O4 NPs). The average hydrodynamic diameter and ζ-potential value of MPMAO-Fe3O4 NPs were analyzed by dynamic light scattering measurement which found to be 43.2 nm and +29.3 mV, respectively.

2-s2.0-85029802487,"Carrying weapons is a significant social and public health problem worldwide, especially among adolescents. The present study examined the association between weapon carrying and related risk behaviors among Thai adolescents. A cross-sectional study of 2,588 high school and vocational school students aged 11 to 19 years from 26 schools in Bangkok, Thailand, was conducted in 2014. This study found that 7.8% of youth reported having carried a weapon in the past 12 months. The high prevalence of weapon carrying was reported by male students, and males were more likely to have reported carrying a weapon than females. The association between weapon carrying and the health risk behaviors like drinking, smoking, any drug use, and physical fighting were significant with higher odds of weapon carrying in all models. Among males, weapon carrying was related to drinking and smoking, any drug use, physical fighting, and school type. Among females, suicidal thoughts were significantly related along with drinking and smoking, any drug use, and physical fighting. Having a mother who used substances was significant only among females. These data could be used for further interventions about weapon carrying to reduce violence. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015."

Methods: Hospitalized patients with fever of unknown origin under physician care were asked to participate and provide blood samples for laboratory tests and screening for endemic diseases at the hospitals. Samples were stored at -80 °C until they were tested at Chulalongkorn University to identify additional pathogens. Results: We were able to identify the etiologic agents in 24.6% of the 463 enrolled patients. Zoonotic and vector borne agents were confirmed in 59 cases (12.7%). Dengue virus (7.3%) was the most frequently detected disease followed by scrub typhus (3.2%). There were two cases of comorbidities of scrub typhus and dengue fever. The other six cases of zoonoses were leptospirosis, melioidosis, and Streptococcus suis infections. Patients with zoonotic/vector borne agents noticed rats in their houses and reported having contact with livestock feces morefrequently than those patients without zoonotic/vector borne agents. Conclusions: Dengue virus and scrub typhus were mostly detected in the rainy season.

2-s2.0-85029742136,"This paper investigates the possible social responses to changes in the strength of the southwest monsoon in northeastern Thailand during the currency of the Angkor civilisation. These assessments are based on hydrogen and carbon isotope records of leaf waxes (δDwax and δ13Cwax) from a 2000-year-long wetland sequence of Pa Kho in northeastern Thailand, a region that formed the northern boundary of the Angkor Kingdom. Our data indicate anthropogenic flooding of the Pa Kho wetland through the control of water through dam construction from c. AD 1300 in response to the fluctuating strength of monsoon rains. δDwax, a proxy for regional hydroclimate variability, corroborates pre-existing evidence that increased summer monsoon rains, which supported the expansion of the agrarian economy, aided the rise of the Angkorian Empire whereas extreme drought contributed to its demise. Interestingly, our δDwax record shows already a gradual decreasing monsoon intensity from c. AD 1000 onwards, although Angkor’s prosperity reached its peak at c. AD 1200. We suggest that the complex hydrological system established under royal patronage at Angkor provided a resilient buffer against short-term monsoon fluctuations. The long-term decline in monsoon rains over a ~300-year period, combined with ongoing urbanisation, may have stretched the hydrological systems to their limit. We suggest that this was a major factor that contributed to the demise of Angkor in the mid-15th century. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-85029671561,"Aim: To determine the association among fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), pulmonary function, and disease activity in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Children aged 7–18 years, diagnosed with SLE under the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association (revised 2012), were enrolled. All eligible participants had disease activity, FENO, and pulmonary function evaluated and re-evaluated at 6-month follow-up. Results: Twenty-four children (95.8% female; mean age 15.2 ± 2 years; median disease duration 2.4 years) were studied. The mean FENO1 and FENO2 were 19.6 ± 7.2 parts per billion (ppb) and 17.4 ± 4.5 ppb, respectively. At baseline, 20.8% had abnormal pulmonary functions (all restrictive defects) and increased to 29.2% at follow-up (isolated restrictive defect 25% and restrictive with diffusion defect 4.2%). Most of their disease activities at baseline and second assessment were non-active (58.3%, 70.8%) or mild disease activities (20.8% both). There was significant correlation between FENO and disease activity (r = 0.49; P-value = 0.02). The significant negative correlation between total lung capacity (TLC) and disease activity was detected in children with active SLE (r = −0.71; P-value = 0.02). Conclusion: Decreased TLC and high FENO were common in SLE children who had no respiratory symptoms and correlated with disease activity. FENO should be considered as an additional pulmonary function to evaluate disease activity in children with SLE. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85030670918,"The goal of this work is to study the feasibility of using bio-based succinate polyol from succinic acid (SA) in preparation of bio-based polyurethane (PU) foams. Bio-based succinate polyols were synthesized by condensation reaction using SA and three types of glycols that are diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol (TEG) and tetraethylene glycol (TTEG) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Bio-based PU foams were prepared using the synthesized polyols with polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI) and H2O as blowing agent. The effects of chain length of prepared polyols toward physical properties of PU foams were studied. Physical and mechanical properties of the prepared PU foams were taken relatively to PU foam obtained from a commercial polyol. The results revealed that hydroxyl number (OH number) and viscosity of prepared polyols decreased as the length of the glycol chains increased (DEG < TEG < TTEG). Optical micrographs images showed that the PU foam prepared from DEG succinate polyol had smaller cell size compared to those prepared from TEG and TTEG succinate polyol respectively. Foam formation time and compressive strength of foams prepared from DEG succinate polyol showed similar results as ones prepared from commercial polyol (POLIMAXX A8360). © 2017, Chiang Mai University.

2-s2.0-85029687466,"BACKGROUND: Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract is a well-described sphincter-preserving technique for the management of fistula in ano. In 2007, we reported our early experience demonstrating a primary success rate of 94.4%. These findings have since been supported by several short-term studies, but long-term results and secondary cure rates after ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract failure remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report a 10-year experience of ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract with extended long-term follow-up. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of single-center data from May 2006 to October 2010 was performed. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a large tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. PATIENTS: All patients with primary or recurrent fistula in ano who underwent a ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract procedure were included. Patients with malignancy, incontinent patients, and patients with rectovaginal fistula were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healing as defined by the absence of symptoms with no visible external opening on clinical examination. Follow-up was continued until May 2016. RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were identified, with a primary healing rate of 87.65% at a median follow-up of 71 months. The healing rates for low transsphincteric, intersphincteric, high transsphincteric, semihorseshoe, and horseshoe fistulas were 92.1%, 85.2%, 60.0%, 89.0%, and 40.0%. Of the 42 patients who had an unhealed fistula after previous non-ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract surgery, 38 (90.48%) healed after the first attempt at ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract. There were 31 patients with unhealed fistulas after the first ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract. Of these, 3 healed spontaneously, and the rest underwent either repeat ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract, fistulotomy (if the recurrence was intersphincteric), or simple curettage (if no internal opening was found). Ultimately, only 2 of the original 251 patients remained unhealed, and there was no change in subjective continence status after surgery. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective design. CONCLUSION: Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract is an effective technique for the treatment of fistula in ano, including recurrent or unhealed fistula after other procedures."

2-s2.0-85028771275,"Anthropogenic disturbances have a detrimental impact on the natural world; the vast expansion of palm oil monocultures is one of the most significant agricultural influences. Primates worldwide consequently have been affected by the loss of their natural ecosystems. Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascilularis) in Southern Thailand have, however, learned to exploit oil palm nuts using stone tools. Using camera traps, we captured the stone tool behavior of one macaque group in Ao Phang-Nga National Park. Line transects placed throughout an abandoned oil palm plantation confirmed a high abundance of nut cracking sites. Long-tailed macaques previously have been observed using stone tools to harvest shellfish along the coasts of Thailand and Myanmar. The novel nut processing behavior indicates the successful transfer of existing lithic technology to a new food source. Such behavioral plasticity has been suggested to underlie cultural behavior in animals, suggesting that long-tailed macaques have potential to exhibit cultural tendencies. The use of tools to process oil palm nuts across multiple primate species allows direct comparisons between stone tool using nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic environments. © 2017, The Author(s)."

PVC stabilized with the DAU and the eugenol can be processable at 30 °C lower than that of the PVC stabilized with commercial heat stabilizers. The most remarkable short-term thermal stability belonged to the PVC stabilized with the DAU, and its original color can be maintained at least up to 3 processing cycles. Synergistic behavior in thermal stability of the PVC mixed with DAU and eugenol at mass ratios of 1.5:1.5 was observed. Mechanical properties of DAU- and eugenol-stabilized PVC were higher than the samples with other heat stabilizers. Glass transition temperature of the PVC stabilized with all heat stabilizers was determined to be 99 °C with the exception of the value of 89 °C for eugenol-stabilized PVC. Therefore, the DAU and the eugenol showed high potential to be used as an organic heat stabilizer for PVC because of their non-toxic and good heat resistance properties. © 2017, ASM International."
2-s2.0-85029788720,"Drought stress inhibits rice growth and biomass accumulation. To identify novel regulators of drought-stress responses in rice, we conducted a proteome-level study of the stress-susceptible (SS) Oryza sativa L. cv. ‘Leung Pratew 123’ and its stress-resistant (SR) somaclonal mutant line. In response to osmotic-stress treatments, 117 proteins were differentially accumulated, with 62 and 49 of these proteins detected in the SS and SR rice lines, respectively. There were six proteins that accumulated in both lines. The proteins in the SS line were mainly related to metabolic processes, whereas the proteins identified in the SR line were primarily related to retrotransposons. These observations suggest that retrotransposons may influence the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to osmotic stress. To identify the biological processes associated with drought tolerance in rice, we conducted a co-expression network analysis of 55 proteins that were differentially accumulated in the SR line under osmotic-stress conditions. We identified a major hub gene; LOC_Os04g38600 (encoding a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), suggesting that photosynthetic adaptation via NADP(H) homeostasis contributes to drought tolerance in rice. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków."
2-s2.0-85028707203,"Reperfusion is the only approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke; however, it can cause excessive inflammation responses and aggravate brain damage. Therefore, supplementary treatment against inflammation caused by reperfusion is required. In a previous study from our group, curcumin was demonstrated to decrease infarction volume, brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study was conducted to understand whether curcumin protects against cerebral I/R injury through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. Ischemia for 1 h was induced in vivo in Wistar rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), followed by reperfusion for 24 h, and curcumin was injected intraperitoneally at 30 min prior to reperfusion. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and caspase-3. The findings revealed that inflammation (NF-κB, ICAM-1 and MMP-9) and apoptosis (caspase-3)-related markers were significantly downregulated in the curcumin-treated MCAO group compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO group. Furthermore, brain infarction size, brain edema and neurological dysfunction were attenuated in the curcumin-treated MCAO group compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO group. Taken together, the present results provided evidence that the protective effect of curcumin against cerebral I/R injury might be mediated by anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Therefore, curcumin may be a promising supplementary agent against cerebral I/R injury in the future."

2-s2.0-85028543901,"Objective To compare the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received or did not receive intravenous fluid. Patients and methods This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment. We enrolled acute ischemic stroke patients without dehydration aged between 18 and 85 years with NIH Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) score from 1 to 18 who presented within 72 h after onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.9% NaCl solution 100 ml/h for 3 days or no intravenous fluid. Results On the interim unblinded analysis of the safety data, significant excess early neurological deterioration was observed among patients in the non-intravenous fluid group. Therefore, the study was prematurely discontinued after enrollment of 120 patients, mean age 60 years, 56.6% male. Early neurological deterioration (increased NIHSS ≥3 over 72 h) not of metabolic or hemorrhagic origin was observed in 15% of the non-IV fluid group and 3.3% of the IV fluid group (p = 0.02). Predictors of neurological deterioration were higher NIHSS score, higher plasma glucose, and increased pulse rate. There was no difference in the primary efficacy outcome, NIHSS ≤ 4 at day 7, 83.3% vs 86.7%, p = 0.61 or secondary efficacy outcomes. Conclusion Administration of 0.9% NaCl 100 ml/h for 72 h in patients with acute ischemic stroke is safe and may be associated with a reduced risk of neurological deterioration. These study findings support the use of intravenous fluid in acute ischemic stroke patients with NIHSS less than 18 who have no contraindications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85028327212,"During the cryopreservation process, spermatozoa are exposed to hypertonic solutions contributed by the high concentration of cryoprotectant. During addition and removal of cryoprotectant the spermatozoa are subjected to a substantial osmotic stress. Spermatozoa of different species and different stages of maturation may have different susceptibility to osmotic stress depending on the biology of the cell membrane and this will affect their tolerance to the freezing-thawing stress. The aims of this study were to determine the osmotic tolerance limits for motility, membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential of feline epididymal spermatozoa and to study the effect of osmotic stress on the feline spermatozoa of different epididymal regions. Epididymal spermatozoa from three regions (caput, corpus and cauda) were pre-exposed to various osmolalities (75, 300, 600, 900, 1200 mOsm) in a single step for 10 min and returned to 300 mOsm afterward. Percentage of motile spermatozoa was measured subjectively and membrane integrity (SYBR-14 positive cells) was evaluated prior to and after exposure to different osmolalities. The mitochondrial membrane potential (JC1) of spermatozoa were evaluated using flow cytometer and compared between epididymal regions (caput, corpus and cauda). All the parameters were compared using a mixed procedure. The percentage of motile epididymal spermatozoa decreased significantly when spermatozoa were exposed to 75 mOsm and 600 mOsm. Epididymal spermatozoa showed signs of damage when pre-exposed to 900 and 1200 mOsm and returned to isotonic condition as significant reduction of membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential were observed (P < 0.05). The plasma membrane of spermatozoa from the cauda epididymal region showed higher susceptibility to osmotic stress than the other regions as demonstrated by a significant difference between regions after return to isotonicity from 900 mOsm (P > 0.01) and a difference between caput and corpus after return from 1200 mOsm (P < 0.05). The corpus and cauda epididymal spermatozoa had higher percentage of spermatozoa with high mitochondrial membrane potential than those from caput when exposed to 75, 300 and 600 mOsm (P < 0.05). In conclusion, a single step exposure to hypertonic solution of greater than 600 mOsm prior to return to isotonic condition can cause severe damage to sperm membrane and mitochondrial membrane potential compared to non-returning (exposure to various osmolality but not returned to isotonic condition). Changes in osmolality impacted mostly on sperm motility. Spermatozoa from cauda epididymis were more susceptible to osmotic stress compared to those from corpus and caput indicating that the maturation changes in the sperm membrane during passage through the epididymis increase susceptibility to the osmotic changes that may occur during sperm cryopreservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The purified recombinant enzyme had the characteristic absorption spectrum of a flavoprotein with absorbance peaks at 380 and 450 nm. The optimum pH and temperature for the oxidation of both spermidine and spermine are 8.5 and 30 °C, respectively. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of spermine and spermidine to spermidine and putrescine, respectively, with higher catalytic efficiency when spermine served as substrate. These results suggest that SynPAO is a polyamine oxidase involved in a polyamine back-conversion pathway. Based on the structural analysis, Gln94, Tyr403 and Thr440 in SynPAO are predicted to be important residues in the active site. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"

2-s2.0-85028023806,"Human gnathostomiasis caused by third-stage Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae (G. spinigerum L3) is an important zoonotic disease in tropical areas of the world. The excretory-secretory products (ES) that are excreted by infective larva play a significant role in host immune evasion and tissue destruction. To investigate the poorly understood mechanisms of G. spinigerum L3 pathogenesis, we focused on the potential effect of ES on inducing apoptosis in human immune cells by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a model. Early and late apoptosis of PBMCs were assessed following the exposure of these cells to G. spinigerum L3 ES (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/ml) for 6–48 h. The apoptotic cells were identified by flow cytometric staining of PBMC with FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide. The expression of regulatory genes related to apoptosis mechanisms in ES-treated PBMCs was investigated using a Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array. The results showed significant levels of early phase apoptosis at 18 h and of late phase apoptosis at 24 h. We speculate that this apoptosis in PBMCs occurs via the extrinsic pathway. Apoptosis in the ES-induced PBMCs was observed as quickly as 90 min after exposure, and the highest effect was observed at 18–24 h. Furthermore, ES can trigger apoptosis lasting for 48 h. Our findings expand the understanding of one of the mechanisms involved, immune-evasive strategy mechanism used by G. spinigerum larvae during human gnathostomiasis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
2-s2.0-85028009599,"Salinomycin is a monocarboxylic polyether ionophore isolated from Streptomyces albus. It has been widely used as an antibiotic in veterinary medicine in poultry. A recent study demonstrated that salinomycin selectively inhibits human breast cancer stem cells; one possible mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. Our results show that salinomycin is effective in inhibiting MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9 cell lines which are well-established endocrine resistant cells and has a synergistic effect in combination with tamoxifen using MTT proliferation assay. The inhibitory effect of salinomycin on the reduction of critical ER co-activator; amplified breast 1 (AIB1) mRNA and protein expression is overcoming tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, salinomycin significantly inhibits cell invasion in Matrigel invasion assay. The effect was mediated at least in part by the decrease of matrix metalopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) which is one critical enzyme facilitated in the cell invasion process. In conclusion, salinomycin should be developed as a novel agent used alone or in combination for endocrine-resistant breast cancer. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"
2-s2.0-85027502485,"Silk cocoon is produced from silkworm (Bombyx mori) to protect itself from outer environment. Various strains of cocoon contain different forms and amounts of flavonoids, which may affect on their antioxidant activity. Moreover, the extraction method would influence the amount of flavonoids extracted. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the flavonoids in 3 strains of bivoltine Bombyx mori silk cocoon (Chul 1/1; white cocoon, Chul 3/2; greenish cocoon, and Chul 4/2; yellow cocoon) extracted by 6 different solvents including acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, methanol, and purified water. The flavonoids extracted were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The antioxidant activity of flavonoids extracted was also investigated by visible spectroscopy at 517 nm. The results showed that Chul 3/2 silk cocoon contained the highest amount of flavonoids. Purified water seemed to be the best solvent that preserved most antioxidant activity of the flavonoids extracted. Flavonoids in Chul 1/1 and Chul 4/2 silk cocoon were rarely found, however they contained some antioxidant activities. The data from this study can provide basic information for flavonoid extraction from silk cocoon which can also apply for other flavonoid-containing natural biomaterials. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85026501569,"Skeletal dysplasias are a complex group of more than 350 disorders with phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity affecting bone and cartilage growth. We studied a 2-year-old girl and her 21-year-old mother with disproportionate short stature. In addition to typical features of hypochondroplasia found in both patients, the child had deformities of the extremity bones, metaphyseal flares, and bilateral transverse (Bowdler) fibular spurs with overlying skin dimples detected at birth. Intravenous pamidronate was started in the child since the age of 17 days, and then every two months. Exome sequencing revealed that the girl was heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.1651A>G, p.Ile538Val) in exon 13 of FGFR3, a known mutation for hypochondroplasia, inherited from her mother. Interestingly, the child also harbored compound heterozygous missense mutations in exon 12 of ALPL, c.1460C>T (p.Ala487Val) inherited from her mother and c.1479C>A (p.Asn493Lys) inherited from her healthy father. The former mutation was previously reported in perinatal hypophosphatasia while the latter was novel. Constantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels including the one before the pamidronate administration and a substantially elevated level of plasma pyridoxal 5′-phosphate detected at age 28 months supported the diagnosis of hypophosphatasia. After a definite diagnosis was achieved, pamidronate was withdrawn at the age of 28 months. No adverse events were observed during pamidronate therapy. In conclusion, we describe a unique case with monoallelic FGFR3 and biallelic ALPL mutations leading to features of both hypochondroplasia and hypophosphatasia. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85026883420,"The ruby deposits of the Uluguru and Mahenge Mts, Morogoro Region, are related to marbles which represent the cover sequence of the Eastern Granulites in Tanzania. In both localities the cover sequences define a tectonic unit which is present as a nappe structure thrusted onto the gneissic basement in a north-western direction. Based on structural geological observations the ruby deposits are bound to mica-rich boudins in fold hinges where fluids interacted with the marble-host rock in zones of higher permeability. Petrographic observations revealed that the Uluguru Mts deposits occur within calcite-dominated marbles whereas deposits in the Mahenge Mts are found in dolomite-dominated marbles. The mineral assemblage describing the marble-hosted ruby deposit in the Uluguru Mts is characterised by corundum-dolomite-phlogopite ± spinel, calcite, pargasite, scapolite, plagioclase, margarite, chlorite, tourmaline whereas the assemblage corundum-calcite-plagioclase-phlogopite ± dolomite, pargasite, sapphirine, titanite, tourmaline is present in samples from the Mahenge Mts. Although slightly different in mineral assemblage it was possible to draw a similar ruby formation history for both localities. Two ruby forming events were distinguished by textural differences, which could also be modeled by thermodynamic T–XCO2 calculations using non-ideal mixing models of essential minerals. A first formation of ruby appears to have taken place during the prograde path (M1) either by the breakdown of diaspore which was present in the original sedimentary precursor rock or by the breakdown of margarite to corundum and plagioclase. The conditions for M1 metamorphism was estimated at ∼750 °C at 10 kbar, which represents granulite facies conditions. A change in fluid composition towards a CO2 dominated fluid triggered a second ruby generation to form. Subsequently, the examined units underwent a late greenschist facies overprint. In the framework of the East African Orogen we assume that the prograde ruby formation occurred at the commonly observed metamorphic event around 620 Ma. At the peak or during beginning of retrogression the fluid composition changed triggering a second ruby generation. The late stage greenschist facies overprint could have occurred at the waning stage of this metamorphic episode which is in the range of ∼580 Ma. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85026895976,"Purpose: Flame-shaped pseudo-occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) is a flow-related phenomenon that creates computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings that mimic tandem intracranial-extracranial ICA occlusion or dissection. We aim to determine the diagnostic performance of mid-cervical flame-shaped extracranial ICA sign on CTA in hyperacute ischemic stroke patients. Methods: We retrospectively included consecutive anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients presenting within 6 h of symptom onset who underwent 4D brain CTA and arterial-phase neck CTA using a 320-detector CT scanner during August 2012 to July 2015. Two blinded readers independently reviewed arterial-phase neck CTA and characterized the extracranial ICA configurations into mid-cervical flame-shaped, proximal blunt/beak-shaped, and tubular-shaped groups. 4D whole brain CTA was used as a reference standard for intracranial ICA occlusion detection. Diagnostic performance of the mid-cervical flame-shaped extracranial ICA sign and interobserver reliability were calculated. Results: Of the 81 cases, 11 had isolated intracranial ICA occlusion, and 6 had true extracranial ICA occlusion. Mid-cervical flame-shaped extracranial ICA sign was found in 45.5% (5/11) of isolated intracranial ICA occlusions but none in the true extracranial ICA occlusion group. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of the mid-cervical flame-shaped extracranial ICA sign for the detection of isolated intracranial ICA occlusion were 45.5, 100, 100, 92.1, and 92.6%, respectively. Interobserver reliability was 0.90. Conclusion: The mid-cervical flame-shaped extracranial ICA sign may suggest the presence of isolated intracranial ICA occlusion and allow reliable exclusion of tandem extracranial-intracranial ICA occlusion in hyperacute ischemic stroke setting. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
2-s2.0-85026308072,"A novel prototype IT/BF-MBR (inclined-tube/biofilm - membrane bioreactor) was developed as a single compact reactor for biological nutrient removal and building wastewater reuse. The system consists of three compartments; first-stage biofilm compartment (Tube 1), second-stage biofilm compartment (Tube 2) and aerobic membrane compartment. The wastewater from a 20-floor building in Chulalongkorn University was fed to the system at organic loading rate of 1.6 kg COD/m3-day. The IT/BF-MBR was operated with hydraulic retention time, HRT of 4.4 h. In this study, influence of two sludge recirculation patterns on biological nutrient removal was investigated. Sludge recirculation pattern 1 was the sludge recirculation from aerobic compartment to the front Tube 1 and Tube 2 compartments at the same flowrate. For the sludge recirculation pattern 2, the sludge recirculation was from aerobic compartment to Tube 2 and from Tube 2 to Tube 1. Total sludge recirculation rates for both slude recirculation patterns were kept at 200% of feed flowrate,Qin. From long-term system operation, it was found that the sludge recirculation pattern 2 could achieve higher phosphorus removal efficiency due to more complete anaerobic condition inside Tube 1. COD, nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were 95.0, 96.4 and 94.0%, respectively. Moreover, real-time PCR assay was performed for the microbial population quantification of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), Nitrospira and Candidatus Accumulibacter inside the IT/BF-MBR system. Furthermore, the quality of treated effluent could comply with the water reuse standards for toilet flushing purpose. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85026764982,"Background and Aim: There is limited data on predictors of acute kidney injury in acute on chronic liver failure. We developed a PIRO model (Predisposition, Injury, Response, Organ failure) for predicting acute kidney injury in a multicentric cohort of acute on chronic liver failure patients. Patients and Methods: Data of 2360 patients from APASL-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) was analysed. Multivariate logistic regression model (PIRO score) was developed from a derivation cohort (n=1363) which was validated in another prospective multicentric cohort of acute on chronic liver failure patients (n=997). Results: Factors significant for P component were serum creatinine[(≥2 mg/dL)OR 4.52, 95% CI (3.67-5.30)], bilirubin [(<12 mg/dL,OR 1) vs (12-30 mg/dL,OR 1.45, 95% 1.1-2.63) vs (≥30 mg/dL,OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.2)], serum potassium [(<3 mmol/LOR-1) vs (3-4.9 mmol/L,OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.05-1.97) vs (≥5 mmol/L,OR 4.34, 95% CI 1.67-11.3)] and blood urea (OR 3.73, 95% CI 2.5-5.5); for I component nephrotoxic medications (OR-9.86, 95% CI 3.2-30.8); for R component,Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome,(OR-2.14, 95% CI 1.4-3.3); for O component, Circulatory failure (OR-3.5, 95% CI 2.2-5.5). The PIRO score predicted acute kidney injury with C-index of 0.95 and 0.96 in the derivation and validation cohort. The increasing PIRO score was also associated with mortality (P<.001) in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: The PIRO model identifies and stratifies acute on chronic liver failure patients at risk of developing acute kidney injury. It reliably predicts mortality in these patients, underscoring the prognostic significance of acute kidney injury in patients with acute on chronic liver failure. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-85025104960,"In the present study an antimicrobial wound dressing incorporating the fruit hull of Garcinia mangostana (MT) extracts into sodium alginate (AG)-coated gauze was developed. The effects of varying concentrations of AG on AG-coated gauze samples were studied in terms of swelling ratio, moist environment and blood coagulation properties. Furthermore, measurement of drug release from the AG-MT gauze, antibacterial activity, and in vitro biocompatibility in keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) was assessed. With increasing AG concentration, the AG-gauze showed a higher swelling ratio, briefer moist environment as well as lower blood coagulation results. Compared with other formulations, AG-gauze with 0.5% w/w of AG was selected for incorporation with MT extract. The combination of MT extract was shown to improve antimicrobial efficacy in comparison with the control. The cumulative release of MT extract was found to be 50–55% of the total load after 90 h in an acetate buffer solution and 80–95% in a phosphate buffer solution. An in vitro cytotoxic test showed that 0.01 and 0.02% w/w MT extract loaded AG-gauze were not toxic to HaCaT and HDFa cells. Thus, AG-coated gauze containing MT extract could be a promising candidate for use in wound care. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85025656408,"Spent coffee grounds (SCG) waste has been drawing attentions in the biodiesel industry due to the promising of oil content. However, SCG sources is very disperse and requires a transportation system. Moreover, a complexity of oil extraction steps using hazardous n-hexane can hinder the SCG biodiesel promotion. Therefore, an alternative approach using in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE), an n-hexane free process, was introduced for producing biodiesel at an on-site SCG source. Life cycle assessment was performed to compare the energy usage and environmental impacts between a conventional process, which requires transportation and n-hexane, and an on-site in-situ TE process. Producing SCG biodiesel using conventional process required 43% less energy and produced fewer environmental impacts than those of the on-site in-situ TE. Much of the difference was attributable to 73% of the energy in the in-situ TE being consumed in methanol recovery. Nevertheless, the in-situ TE process gained better scores in terms of respiratory organs and land occupation. A sensitivity analysis of energy usage on transportation distances and fuel consumption rates suggested that an on-site in-situ TE process could be viewed as more favorable once the transportation distance is greater than 180 km with 7 km/L of fuel consumption rate. © 2017 International Energy Initiative"
2-s2.0-85024486112,"Pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O) from Trametes multicolor contains FAD as cofactor, and forms a tetramer. The protein structure of a mutated P2O, T169S (Thr169 is replaced by Ser), in solution was studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation and analyses of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from Trp168 to excited isoalloxazine (Iso*), and was compared with wild type (WT) P2O. Hydrogen bonding between Iso and nearby amino acids was very similar as between T169S and WT protein. Distances between Iso and Tyr456 were extremely heterogeneous among the subunits, 1.7 (1.5 in WT) in subunit A (Sub A), 0.97 (2.2 in WT) in Sub B, 1.3 (2.1 in WT) in Sub C, 1.3 nm (2.0 in WT) in Sub D. Mean values of root of mean square fluctuation over all residues were greater by four times than those in WT. This suggests that the protein structure of T169S is much more flexible than that of WT. Electrostatic (ES) energies between Iso anion in one subunit and ionic groups in the entire protein were evaluated. It was found that more than 50% of the total ES energy in each subunit is contributed from other subunits. Reported fluorescence decays were analyzed by a method as WT, previously reported. Electron affinities of Iso* in T169S were appreciably higher than those in WT. Static dielectric constants near Iso and Trp168 were also quite higher in T169S than those in WT. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

2-s2.0-85021836909,"Objectives: Speech is unique to humans and characterized by facial actions of ∼5 Hz oscillations of lip, mouth or jaw movements. Lip-smacking, a facial display of primates characterized by oscillatory actions involving the vertical opening and closing of the jaw and lips, exhibits stable 5-Hz oscillation patterns, matching that of speech, suggesting that lip-smacking is a precursor of speech. We tested if facial or vocal actions exhibiting the same rate of oscillation are found in wide forms of facial or vocal displays in various social contexts, exhibiting diversity among species. Materials and Methods: We observed facial and vocal actions of wild stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides), and selected video clips including facial displays (teeth chattering; TC), panting calls, and feeding. Ten open-to-open mouth durations during TC and feeding and five amplitude peak-to-peak durations in panting were analyzed. Results: Facial display (TC) and vocalization (panting) oscillated within 5.74 ± 1.19 and 6.71 ± 2.91 Hz, respectively, similar to the reported lip-smacking of long-tailed macaques and the speech of humans. Discussion: These results indicated a common mechanism for the central pattern generator underlying orofacial movements, which would evolve to speech. Similar oscillations in panting, which evolved from different muscular control than the orofacial action, suggested the sensory foundations for perceptual saliency particular to 5-Hz rhythms in macaques. This supports the pre-adaptation hypothesis of speech evolution, which states a central pattern generator for 5-Hz facial oscillation and perceptual background tuned to 5-Hz actions existed in common ancestors of macaques and humans, before the emergence of speech. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

However, the worldwide emergence of CV-A6 infection in HFMD necessitates development of an improved multiplex rRT-PCR method. To rapidly determine the etiology of HFMD, two rRT-PCR assays using TaqMan probes were developed to differentiate among three selected common enteroviruses (EV-A71, CV-A16 and CV-A6) and to enable broad detection of enteroviruses (pan-enterovirus assay). No cross-reactions were observed with other RNA viruses examined. The detection limits of both assays were 10 copies per microliter for EV-A71, CV-A6 and CV-A16, and pan-enterovirus. The methods showed high accuracy (EV-A71, 90.6%; CV-A6, 92.0%; CV-A16, 100%), sensitivity (EV-A71, 96.5%; CV-A6, 95.8%; CV-A16, 99.0%), and specificity (EV-A71, 100%; CV-A6, 99.9%; CV-A16, 99.9%) in testing clinical specimens (n = 1049) during 2014–2016, superior to those of conventional RT-PCR.

2-s2.0-85021815353,"Purpose: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) that possess the ability of self-renewal and multi-potency have been shown to drive tumor progression and metastasis. The majority of recent studies has focused on potential molecules targeting CSCs so as to develop novel strategies for efficient cancer treatment or protection. Here, we show how alpha-lipoic acid (LA), an endogenous mitochondrial anti-oxidant, affects the CSC-like phenotypes of human non-small cell lung cancer-derived H23, H292 and H460 cells. Methods: CSC-like phenotypes were verified by anchorage-independent growth, three-dimensional (3D) spheroid formation and the expression of CSC markers. Enriched CSC populations were used to confirm the effects of LA. Protein ubiquitination and degradation were assessed using immunoprecipitation. Results: We found that treatment with LA reduced the CSC-like phenotype, as indicated by a decreased expression of known CSC markers (CD133, CD44, ALDH1A1, Oct-4 and Nanog) in H460 cells. In addition, we found that LA reduced the CSC-related abilities of anchorage-independent growth and 3D spheroid formation, and suppressed factors related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as E-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug and Snail. Mechanistically, we found that LA suppresses CSC through depletion of the cellular stemness proteins β-catenin and Oct-4 via decreasing the level of active (phosphorylated) Akt. This resulted in the induction of GSK3β-dependent β-catenin ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation and a decrease in the stabilized (phosphorylated) form of Oct-4. The effects of LA on the CSC-like phenotypes were confirmed in CSC enriched H460, H292 and H23 non-small cell lung cancer-derived cells. Conclusion: Our data are indicative for a novel regulatory role and underlying mechanism of LA in the negative regulation of a CSC-like phenotype in non-small cell lung cancer-derived cells. © 2017, International Society for Cellular Oncology."

Materials and methods: Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis were used to detect the stem cell marker CD90. Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining were used to identify osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation, respectively. To characterize TRPM4, patch-clamp recordings were obtained from single cells in the whole-cell configuration mode. The significance of TRPM4 for proliferation and survival was examined with 9-phenanthrol, a TRPM4 inhibitor during a 96-hour period of culture. Real-time Ca2+ imaging analysis with Fura-2AM was used to investigate the impact of TRPM4 on intracellular Ca2+ signals. Results: DPSCs were CD90-positive and differentiated into osteoblasts. Patch-clamp recordings revealed currents typical of TRPM4 that were Ca2+-activated, voltage-dependent and Na+-conducting. Inhibition of TRPM4 resulted in a significant reduction in the cell population after a 96-hr period of culture and transformed the biphasic pattern of intracellular Ca2+ signalling into sustained oscillations. Conclusions: Rat DPSCs have stem cell characteristics and functional TRPM4 channels that are required for proliferation and survival. These data suggest that the shape and frequency of intracellular Ca2+ signals may mediate stem cell proliferation and survival. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
2-s2.0-85021653819,"Biological removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been widely practiced across the world because it overcomes the drawbacks associated with physico-chemical processes. In this study, the role of a novel MAL 1HM19 strain of a nitrate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing bacterium (NR-SOB) isolated from the Mae Um Long Luang hot spring (Thailand) was investigated in batch systems for H2S removal under different initial N-NO3− concentrations (60, 120 and 240 mg N-NO3−/L) at 35 °C. The strain MAL 1HM19 was capable of removing 100% of the gas-phase H2S within 10 h of incubation. In the liquid-phase, the final products depended on the initial N-NO3− concentration: at 120 and 240 mg N-NO3−/L, 15% and 18% SO42− formation was detected, while no SO42− was detected at an initial N-NO3− concentration of 60 mg N-NO3−/L. The identification of strain MAL 1HM19, based on the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence, revealed it was closely related to Paracoccus sp. (99.93% similarity).

2-s2.0-85020920795,"Flavobacterium columnare is one of the deadliest fish pathogens causing devastating mortality in various freshwater fish species globally. To gain an insight into bacterial genomic contents and structures, comparative genome analyses were performed using the reference and newly sequenced genomes of F. columnare including genomovar I, II and I/II strains isolated from Thailand, Europe and the USA. Bacterial genomes varied in size from 3.09 to 3.39 Mb (2714 to 3101 CDSs). The pan-genome analysis revealed open pan-genome nature of F. columnare strains, which possessed at least 4953 genes and tended to increase progressively with the addition of a new genome. Genomic islands (GIs) present in bacterial genomes were diverse, in which 65% (39 out of 60) of possible GIs were strain-specific. A CRISPR/cas investigation indicated at least two different CRISPR systems with varied spacer profiles. On the other hand, putative virulence genes, including those related to gliding motility, type IX secretion system (T9SS), outer membrane proteins (Omp), were equally distributed among F. columnare strains. The MLSA scheme categorized bacterial strains into nine different sequence types (ST 9–17). Phylogenetic analyses based on either 16S rRNA, MLSA and concatenated SNPs of core genome revealed the diversity of F. columnare strains. DNA homology analysis indicated that the estimated digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) between strains of genomovar I and II can be as low as 42.6%, while the three uniquely tilapia-originated strains from Thailand (1214, NK01 and 1215) were clearly dissimilar to other F. columnare strains as the dDDH values were only 27.7–30.4%. Collectively, this extensive diversity among bacterial strains suggested that species designation of F. columnare would potentially require re-emendation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85024123856,"Thailand has experienced a rapid increase in utility-scale solar PV investment (>1 MWp), while the growth of investment in smaller-sized rooftop PV systems is far behind. Due to the continuous decline in PV module costs and the discontinued support in the form of feed-in tariffs, the market is gradually transitioning to installations for the purpose of self-consumption. The main barrier for market expansion is the high upfront costs of solar PV systems. Rather than buying the system, new business models are offering customers to buy the service from solar PV systems instead. The Solar PPA model is an emerging solar service business model in Thailand. This model eliminates the investment cost and operating risks for the customer. This paper takes on the view of a commercial-sized customer to compare the options between the Buying Model and the Solar PPA model. From the customer's viewpoint, the cost of electricity generation, or the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), under the Solar PPA model is more attractive. The results show an LCOE of 4.82 THB/kWh (0.14 USD/kWh) for the Solar PPA model, 9.56% less than buying the system at 5.28 THB/kWh (0.16 USD/kWh). The Solar PPA model also proves to be a more attractive option in most sensitivity cases. This paper discusses conditions under which the model is feasible and recommends that the design of future support schemes for solar PV self-consumption should enable the expansion of innovative business models, including the Solar PPA model and other third-party ownership models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The prototype system was operated with horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s, hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h and fed with the raw wastewater from Julajakrapong building, which is a high-rise building inside Chulalongkorn University at a constant flowrate of 2 m3/day. From the long-term system operation, the most efficient energy-saving system with high performance of nutrient removal could be achieved with the aeration on/off mode of 30/90 min. Moreover, investigation of biofoulant characteristics on membrane surface was performed by SEM-EDX and FT-IR analyses. It was found that protein and carbohydrate were predominant compositions of the biofoulant substances. Main protein composition in the biofoulant was carbonyl group. The reclaimed water can be used for gardening and landscape purposes. Therefore, the novel IT/OD-MBR system can be considered as an alternative for high-rise building's wastewater recycling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85020300667,"This work presented a simple, rapid, green and efficient approach to the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using pullulan as a reducing/stabilizing/capping agent for drug delivery systems to increase the safety and efficacy of these systems. Monodispersed AuNPs@pullulan with prolonged stability were fully characterized by UV-VIS, FTIR, TEM, EDX, TGA and zeta potential analyses. A mechanism of AuNPs formation was proposed in which pullulan created reducing species for the reduction of Au3+ to AuNPs (Au0) that resulted in the formation of spherical AuNPs@pullulan with an average size of approximately 11 ± 5 nm, while the hydroxyl groups of pullulan were oxidized to carboxylate compounds. Novel cassiarin A chloride derivatives (3d and 3i) as candidate anticancer drugs were successfully loaded onto AuNPs@pullulan through electrostatic interactions. AuNPs@pullulan-3d (IC50 = 6.0 ± 0.1 μM) and AuNPs@pullulan-3i (5.2 ± 0.1 μM) exhibited a 10.2-fold and 7.1-fold higher cytotoxicity against KATO-III cells than free compounds 3d (60.9 ± 0.6 μM), 3i (37.1 ± 0.2 μM) and cisplatin (64.5 ± 0.9 μM), respectively. AuNPs@pullulan exhibited high cellular uptake, biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity to normal cells. Therefore, AuNPs@pullulan-3d or AuNPs@pullulan-3i have the potential to be developed for treatment of gastric cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85020002719,"Objective To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels in root-canal exudates from teeth undergoing root-canal treatment. Material and methods The root-canal exudates from six teeth with normal pulp and periradicular tissues that required intentional root canal treatment for prosthodontic reasons and from twelve teeth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis (AAP) were sampled with paper points for bacterial culture and aspirated for the detection of proMMP-2 and active MMP-2 by gelatin zymography and the quantification of MMP-2 levels by ELISA. Results By gelatin zymography, both proMMP-2 and active MMP-2 were detected in the first collection of root-canal exudates from teeth with pulp necrosis and AAP, but not from teeth with normal pulp, and their levels gradually decreased and disappeared at the last collection. Consistently, ELISA demonstrated a significant decrease in MMP-2 levels in the root-canal exudates of teeth with pulp necrosis and AAP following root canal procedures (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the MMP-2 levels were significantly lower in the negative bacterial culture than those in the positive bacterial culture (p < 0.001). Conclusions The levels of MMP-2 in root-canal exudates from teeth with pulp necrosis and AAP were gradually reduced during root canal procedures. Future studies are required to determine if MMP-2 levels may be used as a biomolecule for the healing of apical lesions, similar to the clinical application of MMP-8 as a biomarker. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85020250409,"Objective Different mechanical stimuli regulate behaviors of various cell types, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Notch signaling participates in the mechanical stress-regulated cell responses. The present study investigated the regulation of Notch target gene and sclerostin (Sost) expression in murine pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) under intermittent compressive stress. Methods MC3T3-E1 were subjected to the intermittent compressive force under the computerized controlled machine. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with chemical inhibitors for Notch and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling prior to mechanical stimuli. To evaluate role of Notch signaling in MC3T3-E1 cells under unloaded condition, cells were seeded on indirect immobilized Notch ligand (Jagged1). Gene expression was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results The intermittent compressive stress significantly upregulated Notch target gene expression (Hes Family BHLH transcription factor 1; Hes1 and Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein1; Hey1). The intermittent stress-induced Hes1 and Hey1 mRNA expression could be inhibited by a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) or a TGF-β superfamily type I activing receptor-like kinase receptors inhibitor (SB431542). The results imply that intermittent compressive stress regulates Notch signaling via TGF-β pathway. Further, the intermittent compressive stress reduced Sost mRNA expression and this phenomenon could be rescued by a DAPT pretreatment, implying the involvement of Notch signaling. However, activation of Notch signaling under the unloaded condition resulted in the increase of Sost expression and the reduction of osteogenic marker genes. Conclusions These results imply the involvement of Notch signaling in the homeostasis maintaining of osteogenic cells under mechanical stress stimuli. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85021748422,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an important arbovirus that is capable of directly infecting neuronal cells. Infection can cause microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ZIKV is sexually transmitted, especially from infected males to uninfected females. This study aimed to investigate the transmission pattern of ZIKV in semen using boar semen. Experiments were performed ex vivo using semen from healthy boar. The samples were infected with ZIKV, and viral RNA was detected and cell morphology was examined at different time points postinfection. ZIKV infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Viral RNA levels were found to markedly decrease as the time postinfection increased, without any evidence of virus replication. The sperm showed no significant changes in morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-free sperm, suggesting that ZIKV cannot replicate in boar semen. We suggest three possible reasons underlying this phenomenon. First, the spermatozoa of boar might not be the target of ZIKV associated with sexual transmission. Second, the effect of the external environment on spermatozoa may affect ZIKV replication. Third, ZIKV may not be tropic for spermatozoa. This ex vivo study might be used as a platform to study the association of sexual transmission with ZIKV in other longer-lasting cells, such as Leydig or Sertoli cells. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria."
2-s2.0-85020209148,"Background: Dialysis in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and comorbidities may not be associated with improved life expectancy compared to conservative management. To inform clinical practice, we performed a systematic review of all available studies examining this hypothesis. Methods: We performed a systematic review of retrospective and prospective cohort studies of older adults with stage-5 CKD who chose dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or opted for conservative management (including management of complications of CKD and palliative care). Outcomes of interest included hospitalizations and mortality. Results: Twelve cohort studies (11,515 patients) were identified with most of them focusing on older adults. Patients choosing dialysis were younger compared to those opting for conservative management and were less functionally impaired. Patients opting for conservative management received care in a multidisciplinary setting focusing on palliative care and management of complications of CKD. Patients choosing dialysis and conservative management had a median survival time of 8-67 and 6-30 months, respectively. In a subset of studies of patients 65 years and older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, and where the multivariable analyses included age and comorbidities, by meta-analysis, patients choosing dialysis had a pooled adjusted hazard ratio for mortality of 0.53 (95% CI 0.30-0.91, p = 0.02) relative to those opting for conservative management; however, significant heterogeneity precluded definitive conclusions. Conclusions: When caring for older adults with advanced CKD who are contemplating dialysis therapy vs. conservative management, efforts must focus on promoting patient values and preferences, shared decision-making, and symptom burden alleviation. © 2017 S.

In this study, we determined whether and how K. parviflora ethanolic extract and M. fragrans volatile oil could influence the levels of neurotransmitters and the whole proteomic profile in the hippocampus of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The effects of K. parviflora and M. fragrans on protein changes were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-gel), and proteins were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The target proteins were then confirmed by Western blot. The levels of neurotransmitters were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that K. parviflora, M. fragrans and fluoxetine (the control drug for this study) increased serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the rat hippocampus compared to that of the vehicle-treated group. Our proteomic data showed that 37 proteins in the K. parviflora group were up-regulated, while 14 were down-regulated, and 27 proteins in the M. fragrans group were up-regulated, while 16 were down-regulated. In the fluoxetine treatment group, we found 29 proteins up-regulated, whereas 14 proteins were down-regulated. In line with the proteomic data, the levels of GFAP, PDIA3, DPYSL2 and p-DPYSL2 were modified in the SD rat groups treated with K. parviflora, M. fragrans and fluoxetine as confirmed by Western blot. K. parviflora and M. fragrans mediated not only the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters but also the proteomic profiles in the rat hippocampus, thus shedding light on the mechanisms targeting neurodegenerative diseases. © 2017 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University"

Currently, commercial human subunit vaccines are used commonly to prevent the influenza symptom based on the WHO recommendation. In case of current reassortant swine influenza viruses transmitting from pigs to humans, the efficacy of current human influenza vaccines is of interest. In this study, influenza A negative pigs were vaccinated with selected commercial human subunit vaccines and challenged with rH3N2. All sera were tested with both HI and SN assays using four representative viruses from the surveillance data in 2012 (enH1N1, pdmH1N1, rH1N2 and rH3N2). The results showed no significant differences in clinical signs and macroscopic and microscopic findings among groups. However, all pig sera from vaccinated groups had protective HI titers to the enH1N1, pdmH1N1 and rH1N2 at 21 DPV onward and had protective SN titers only to pdmH1N1and rH1N2 at 21 DPV onward. SN test results appeared more specific than those of HI tests. All tested sera had no cross-reactivity against the rH3N2. Both studied human subunit vaccines failed to protect and to stop viral shedding with no evidence of serological reaction against rH3N2.

2-s2.0-84988683853,"To examine cytokine receptor biomarkers in bipolar disorder (BD), we recruited 133 well-phenotyped BD patients and 50 normal controls and measured serum levels of soluble interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), sIL-6R, and tumor necrosis factor receptor 60 and 80 kDa (sTNFR60/80). sIL-1RA and sTNFR80 are significantly higher in BD than in controls and sTNFR80 and higher in melancholic than in non-melancholic patients and controls. Kapczinski’s stages 3 + 4 are characterized by lowered sIL-2R and increased sTNFR80 levels. Acute phase depression is characterized by increased sTNFR80 levels as compared with controls, manic, and euthymic patients. Both sTNFR60 and sTNFR80 levels are significantly and positively related with severity of depression but not mania. Logistic regression analysis showed that the significant predictors for BD are increased sIL-1RA levels, nicotine dependence and a family history of depression and alcoholism. The risk factors for stages 3 + 4 are lowered sIL-2R levels and nicotine dependence. Melancholia is predicted by higher sTNFR80 levels and female sex. Severity of depression is predicted by female sex, nicotine dependence, and increased sTNFR60 and sTNFR80 levels. Cell-mediated immunity is activated during a current episode of depression but not (hypo)mania or the euthymic state. There are no associations between the biomarkers and age at onset, duration of illness, severity of mania, bipolar (BP)2 or BP1 subtypes, rapid cycling, atypical depression, psychotic or suicidal symptoms, and a family history of psychiatric disease. The results show that increased sIL-1RA may be a trait marker of BD, increased sTNFR80 a state marker of the depressive phase, especially melancholia, while lower sIL-2R but higher sTNFR80 may be staging biomarkers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85013845539,"Background: Understanding the pathways by which interventions achieve behavioral change is important for optimizing intervention strategies. Purpose: We examined mediators of behavior change in a tailored-risk communication intervention that increased guideline-based colorectal cancer screening among individuals at increased familial risk. Methods: Participants at increased familial risk for colorectal cancer (N = 481) were randomized to one of two arms: (1) a remote, tailored-risk communication intervention (Tele-Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation (TeleCARE)) or (2) a mailed educational brochure intervention. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that participants in TeleCARE were more likely to get a colonoscopy. The effect was partially mediated through perceived threat (β = 0.12, p < 0.05), efficacy beliefs (β = 0.12, p < 0.05), emotions (β = 0.22, p < 0.001), and behavioral intentions (β = 0.24, p < 0.001). Model fit was very good: comparative fit index = 0.95, root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.05, and standardized root-mean-square residual = 0.08. Conclusion: Evaluating mediating variables between an intervention (TeleCARE) and a primary outcome (colonoscopy) contributes to our understanding of underlying mechanisms that lead to health behavior change, thus leading to better informed and designed future interventions.

The structural and surface properties of all samples were characterized by low and high-angle XRD, nitrogen physisorption, FTIR, Raman, UV–Vis, SEM/EDX, TEM, and NH3-TPD techniques. The experimental results demonstrated that the samples obtained from the sol–gel method retain the two-dimensional hexagonal order structure of SBA-15. Compared to samples obtained from the hydrothermal method, the pore system lacking long-range order was observed. The incorporation of Zr and bimetal (Zr and La) had an effect on the textural properties of both synthesized SBA-15 samples. This modified SBA-15 mesoporous samples still exhibited high specific surface area, large pore volume and narrow pore size distribution. Surface acidity in the SBA-15 silica suggests new active sites, especially Brønsted acid type, indicating its future potential applications when acid sites are required. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Therefore, this study set out to compare the psychometric properties including agreement, convergent, and known-group validity between the SF-6D and the EQ-5D-5L using the real value sets from Thailand and the UK in patients with chronic diseases. Methods: 356 adults taking a medication for at least 3 months were identified from a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, between July 2014 and March 2015. Agreement was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland–Altman plots. Convergent validity was evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between SF-6D and EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS and SF-12v2. For known-groups validity, the Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test were used to examine the associations between SF-6D and EQ-5D-5L and patient characteristics. Results: Agreements between the SF-6D and the EQ-5D-5L using Thai and UK value sets were fair, with ICCs of 0.45 and 0.49, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed that the majority of the SF-6D index scores were lower than the EQ-5D-5L index scores. Both the EQ-5D-5L value sets were more related to the EQ-VAS and physical health, while the SF-6D was more associated with mental health. Both EQ-5D-5L value sets were more sensitive than the SF-6D in discriminating patients with different levels of more known groups except for adverse drug reactions. Conclusions: The SF-6D and both EQ-5D-5L value sets appeared to be valid but sensitive to different outcomes in Thai patients with chronic diseases. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

This study examined IP techniques to improve the accuracy of analyzing the size distribution of aggregates in an asphalt mixture, and proposed two new methods: seven-layer overlaying (SLO) and size-based multiple erosion (SBME) to solve the problem of identifying connected aggregate particles that often occurs in typical IP applications. The proposed methods were tested for their effectiveness with a typical IP method using a referenced sectional image of asphalt mixture. Both the proposed methods successfully improved the accuracy of detection (number and size distribution) of aggregate particles, but the SBME approach was superior over the SLO method. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

We sought to assess the performance characteristics of EUS nCLE for differentiating mucinous from non-mucinous PCLs in a larger series of patients with a definitive diagnosis. Methods Six endosonographers (nCLE experience >30 cases each) blinded to all clinical data, reviewed nCLE images of PCLs from 29 patients with surgical (n = 23) or clinical (n = 6) correlation. After 2 weeks, the assessors reviewed the same images in a different sequence. A tutorial on available and novel nCLE image patterns was provided before each review. The performance characteristics of nCLE and the κ statistic for interobserver agreement (IOA, 95% confidence interval [CI]), and intraobserver reliability (IOR, mean ± standard deviation [SD]) for identification of nCLE image patterns were calculated. Landis and Koch interpretation of κ values was used. Results A total of 29 (16 mucinous PCLs, 13 non-mucinous PCLs) nCLE patient videos were reviewed. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of mucinous PCLs were 95%, 94%, and 95%, respectively. The IOA and IOR (mean ± SD) were κ = 0.81 (almost perfect); 95% CI, 0.71-0.90; and κ = 0.86 ± 0.11 (almost perfect), respectively. The overall specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of serous cystadenomas (SCAs) were 99%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. The IOA and IOR (mean ± SD) for recognizing the characteristic image pattern of SCA were κ = 0.83 (almost perfect); 95% CI, 0.73-0.92; and κ = 0.85 ± 0.11 (almost perfect), respectively. Conclusions EUS-guided nCLE can provide virtual histology of PCLs with a high degree of accuracy and inter- and intraobserver agreement in differentiating mucinous versus non-mucinous PCLs.

In this study, the possibility of using electrical current to select electrochemical active bacteria from sub-sediment for use in MFC was conducted. By using an alternating current (AC) of 0.6-12 mA and selective media, 16 Gram-positive ferric reducing bacteria (GP-FRB), 15 Gram-negative ferric reducing bacteria (GN-FRB) and 9 Gram-negative non FRB (GN-nonFRB) were characterized. GN-FRB and GP-FRB were obtained from the current of 0.6-6 and 9-12 mA, respectively. After tested in MFC, GN-FRB had a greater current density and power density than those from GN-nonFRB and GP-FRB. However, the greatest voltage was obtained from GP-FRB, followed by those of GN-nonFRB and GN-FRB, respectively. The highest current and power density of 13.33 mA/m2 and 0.32 mW/m2, respectively were from GN-FRB namely KL14 which was identified later as Proteus sp.

The data are provided by five participated cement industries in the country starting from the year 2001 to 2014. The key performance indices corresponding to the GHG reduction technologies are calculated and presented. The results indicate that the annual average of the direct CO2 emission from the cement sector is 33.1 million tonnes of CO2, which contributes nearly 15% of the total national GHG emission. This amount of CO2 emission originates from the calcination and the fuel combustion parts by 21.3 and 11.8 million tonnes of CO2, respectively. The average specific net and gross CO2 emissions are 727 and 733 kg of CO2 per tonne cementitious, respectively. The average specific indirect CO2 emission from external electricity production is 60.5 kg of CO2 per tonne cement. The average specific thermal and electrical consumption is 3.32 GJ per tonne clinker and 117 kWh per tonne cement, respectively. The average alternative and bio fuel thermal ratios are 2.51 and 5.24%, respectively. The average clinker-to-cement ratio is 82.4%. From the analysis, it is indicated that the use of the bio fuels have been an effective mitigation action in the past decade, and the use of the alternative fuels have been employed in the last few years. The implementation of the electrical energy efficiency and the WHR unit causes the specific indirect CO2 emission from external electricity generation decreasing steadily over the past decade. On the other hand, the key technology for the direct CO2 reduction potential is the clinker substitution.

Nowadays, the design standards of fall protection system, e.g., guardrail have not considered workers’ feelings. However, workers’ feelings such as safety feeling and convenient feeling may affect safety and productivity of construction workers. The objective of this paper is to propose a construction workers’ feeling measurement by feeling measurement tools used for guardrail design in high-rise building construction projects. The three types of the tool were developed for construction workers’ feeling measurement, such as 2-D of construction project environment included dimension and characteristics of guardrails 2-D pictures with dimension of guardrails related to workers’ dimension, and Virtual Reality (VR) models run in Virtual Environment (VE) equipment called CAVE. The standard deviation (S.D.) and Coefficient of Variation (C.V.) of workers’ feelings were used to indicate the performance of workers’ feeling measurement tools. Moreover, in the case study, the most effective tool was applied to measure the workers’ feelings in order to design the guardrail by considering not only cost of guardrail, but also construction workers’ feelings. The suitable guardrail was analyzed by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The results of construction workers’ feeling measurement by the three types of the tool showed that for guardrail design, workers’ feeling measurement by VR models in CAVE is the most effective tool compared with others. From the result of the case study, it showed that the suitable types of guardrail can be designed by considering both cost of guardrail and construction workers’ feelings. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

Nevertheless, the measurement of either phenytoin or phenobarbital concentrations might not be available in some rural hospitals. Information assisting individualized phenytoin and phenobarbital combination therapy is important. This study's objective was to determine the relationship between the maximum rate of metabolism of phenytoin (Vmax) and phenobarbital clearance (CLPB), which can serve as a guide to individualized drug therapy. Data on phenytoin and phenobarbital concentrations of 19 epileptic patients concurrently receiving both drugs were obtained from medical records. Phenytoin and phenobarbital pharmacokinetic parameters were studied at steady-state conditions. The relationship between the elimination parameters of both drugs was determined using simple linear regression. A high correlation coefficient between Vmax and CLPB was found [r=0.744; p<0.001 for Vmax (mg/kg/day) vs. CLPB (L/kg/day)]. Such a relatively strong linear relationship between the elimination parameters of both drugs indicates that Vmax might be predicted from CLPB and vice versa. Regression equations were established for estimating Vmax from CLPB, and vice versa in patients treated with combination of phenytoin and phenobarbital. These proposed equations can be of use in aiding individualized drug therapy. © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Initially, titanium dioxide sol (TiO2 sol) was synthesized via sol-gel method and then used to intercalate between graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets for increased GO dispersion and loading prior to electroless deposition. The parameters controlling the coating appearance and property, (e.g. amount of TiO2 sol, electroless plating time and amount of GO) were systematically optimized. The as prepared NiP-TiO2 sol-RGO and the coated steel surface morphologies were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance and conductivity of the coated steel were examined by contact angle measurement, electrochemical testing and four-point probe conductivity measurement, respectively. NiP-TiO2 sol-RGO coated steels show high homogeneity coating with ultra-thin water-repellent RGO layer fully covering on the outer surface leading to significant improved corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity of steel. These promising properties of the coating might be very useful for electronic part applications, which requires both high corrosion resistance and high conductivity with less sensitive to humidity, such as electronic parts and electrode for electrochemical sensors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85032001883,"Two pixel sensors, namely active pixel sensor (APS) and pseudo-active pixel sensor (PAPS), are reviewed to show that APS suffers from dark current while PAPS suffers from leakage current. Then a new pixel sensor called zero bias pixel sensor (ZBPS) in which only two MOS switches in addition to the photodiode are used, one for connecting the pixel’s photodiode to a column bus and the other for bypassing it. A zero-bias column buffer-direct-injection (ZCBDI) circuit, which is similar to a regulated cascode amplifier, is used to control the voltage at column bus at zero. All ZBPS pixels are guaranteed to work at zero voltage at all times to eliminate the dark current as well as leakage current. A case of a 10µm x 10µm ZBPS pixel designed with standard 0.1µm CMOS process is studied through simulation. This pixel generates a photocurrent within a range from 1pA to 100nA. To handle a large variation of photocurrent while maintaining zero column voltage, the ZCBDI is designed using differential cascode, common source, and buffer stages and then compensated for 50 degree phase margin.

2-s2.0-85032011629,"This paper presents analysis of the multi-objective optimal operation of designed BEMS which contains cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) and thermal energy storage (TES) as energy sources. The previously designed BEMS consists of CHP as the main energy supply with absorption chiller and auxiliary boiler. It is observed that there is excessive heat energy from CHP operation which is enough for further utilization. In this paper, TES is additional component to utilize excessive heat energy released from CHP operation. TES cooperates with CHP and auxiliary boiler to supply heat energy to meet the cooling load demand in the building. There are two objective functions for consideration, namely, total operating cost (TOC) and total carbon dioxide emission (TCOE). The multi-objective framework combines both objective functions and employs the weighted sum of TOC and TCOE. Furthermore, we vary initial state of TES from 0-20% of TES’s capacity and analyze its effect on TOC and TCOE. We apply the multi-objective approach to a large shopping mall. Numerical results show that setting initial state of TES to 0% can offer more reduction of TOC and TCOE than other initial conditions. The multi-objective optimal operation converges to minimum TOC when a weighting factor is 0. On the other hand, it converges to the minimum TCOE when the weighting factor is 1. In addition, the trade-off curve showing a relationship between TOC and TCOE provides operating points which depends on operator’s decision criterion. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85032005522,"Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) are being developed worldwide due to their unique advantage of wide area coverage. GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) is an Indian implementation of SBAS, with three (03) geo stationary satellites in space covering a huge area even beyond Indian Territory. This study focused on analyzing the improvement in position solution with GAGAN corrections over Sri Lanka. In order to test its performances, several dual and single frequency GNSS receivers were used in this experiment, one receiver was configured as SBAS receiver and other two were kept as GPS stand-alone receivers. Observations were carried out over seven (07) known control stations of six (6) different districts to investigate its coverage over Sri Lanka. At each of the tested stations the GAGAN active L1 receiver has always shown a significant accuracy improvement over L1 uncorrected observations. Further, five out of the seven (7) observation locations the calculated average 3D positional errors were lower than 1m. Almost 79% of observations (out of 24 hours of observations) have shown acceptable 3D positional accuracy, of less than 1m, for many spatial data collection applications. However, the local DGPS correction has shown higher reliability than GAGAN corrections with almost 85% of observations with less than 1m, 3D positional error. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85027871412,"Two novel diterpenes, phyllanes A and B, were isolated from the roots of Phyllanthus acidus, along with the cleistanthane diterpene, spruceanol. Their chemical structures were unambiguously elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR analyses and high resolution mass spectroscopic data, as well as by comparison with literature data. While phyllanes A and B are respectively reminiscent of amphilectane and serrulatane diterpenoids, their highly unusual substitution patterns and their co-occurrence with spruceanol led us to assume that they might correspond to an unprecedented type of re-arranged cleistanthane-diterpenoid precursors, resulting in final products that display a unique scaffold among terrestrial diterpenoids. Accordingly, a possible biosynthetic route to the two new compounds from the readily accessible spruceanol is proposed herein. These two compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against two cancer cell lines. Only phyllane B exerted a moderate activity against K562 and HepG2 cell line with IC50 values of 28.90 and 45.23 μg/mL, respectively. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85026921817,"A paper-based colorimetric sensor was fabricated using polymethylacrylic acid-templated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) as a sensing probe for the detection of Fe2+ and employing an ion exchange polymeric membrane as a coating layer. AgNCs were impregnated on a cellulose filter paper. The AgNC-impregnated filter paper was then lacquered with a hydrophobic membrane of polyvinyl chloride plasticized with o-NPOE incorporating a hydrophobic cation exchanger. Due to the ion exchange phenomenon at the membrane surface, Fe2+ was extracted into the paper layer, and the bound Ag+ on the AgNCs was reduced by Fe2+. The growth of the cluster could be observed by measuring the increase in the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) plasmon band. The maximum plasmon band on the paper at 447 nm increased as a linear function of the increasing Fe2+ concentration. The proposed sensor was highly selective to Fe2+ over Fe3+ and other cations. The proposed sensor was optimized and could be used to detect Fe2+ solution concentrations as low as 50 μM, with a wide working linear concentration range of 0.2–1.0 mM. The sensor was applied to determine Fe2+ in iron supplement tablet samples with satisfactory results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85030112873,"The production of diesel-like fuel and base oil from bioderived fatty alcohol through a two-steps process, dehydration reaction and oligomerization reaction, was studied. The bioderived 1-decanol was converted to olefin mixtures and di-n-decyl ether via the dehydration over commercial alumina catalysts with and without acid modification in a fixed-bed reactor at different temperatures. The catalysts studied were characterized using nitrogen adsorption, temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The dehydration reaction over the unmodified Al2O3 was found to be dominant toward the selectivity for 1-decene. The modified Al2O3 was shown to promote skeletal internal isomerization and cracking reaction due to strong acid sites. Furthermore, the stability testing results of 1.5 M (H2SO4)/Al2O3 at 573 K demonstrated a rapid deactivation of strong acid sites during the first 10 h of operation. Oligomerization of mixed olefins (1-decanol, 1-decene, and internal olefin) over USY zeolite was found to give the highest conversion of 60%, compared to other zeolites, and the selectivities for dimers, trimers, and heavier hydrocarbons were 72, 24, and 4%, respectively. Evaluation of oligomers properties such as viscosity, viscosity index, simulation distillation, and pour point indicated that dimers and heavier hydrocarbons after hydrogenation can be used as transportation fuel and biobased oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85026915368,"An innovative phase transferring process of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from aqueous to a wide range of organic solvents (e.g. toluene, n-butanol, iso-butyl acetate, ethyl-acetate, acetonitrile and ethylene glycol) was described. In the developed process, AgNPs were transferred to the organic solvents by using graphene oxide (GO) as a carrier. The transferring process was utilized by only two straightforward steps. Firstly, the composite of graphene oxide-silver nanoparticles (GO/AgNPs) were synthesized using N,N′ dimethylformamide (DMF) as a reducing agent. The existence, purity and stability of AgNPs on the GO sheets were examined by UV–visible spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM. Secondly, the composite GO/AgNP were modified with oleylamine (OAm) in order to improve hydrophobicity. To reach the maximum phase transfer efficiency, an appropriate amount of OAm was carefully optimized. The dispersion behaviors of the composite GO/AgNP modified with OAm (GO/AgNP-OAm) in the organic solvents were investigated. It was found that the GO/AgNP-OAm are uniformly dispersed in the organic solvents for at least 18 h after sonication. The developed phase transfer method has the features of simplicity and high efficiency, moreover, it suitable to be scaled up for the industrial application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85029674170,"Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a nucleic acid mimic in which the deoxyribose-phosphate was replaced by a peptide-like backbone. The absence of negative charge in the PNA backbone leads to several unique behaviors including a stronger binding and salt independency of the PNA-DNA duplex stability. However, PNA possesses poor aqueous solubility and cannot directly penetrate cell membranes. These are major obstacles that limit in vivo applications of PNA. In previous strategies, the PNA can be conjugated to macromolecular carriers or modified with positively charged side chains such as guanidinium groups to improve the aqueous solubility and cell permeability. In general, a preformed modified PNA monomer was required. In this study, a new approach for post-synthetic modification of PNA backbone with one or more hydrophilic groups was proposed. The PNA used in this study was the conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA with prolyl-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid dipeptide backbone (acpcPNA) that shows several advantages over the conventional PNA. The aldehyde modifiers carrying different linkers (alkylene and oligo(ethylene glycol)) and end groups (-OH, -NH2, and guanidinium) were synthesized and attached to the backbone of modified acpcPNA by reductive alkylation. The hybrids between the modified acpcPNAs and DNA exhibited comparable or superior thermal stability with base-pairing specificity similar to those of unmodified acpcPNA. Moreover, the modified apcPNAs also showed the improvement of aqueous solubility (10-20 folds compared to unmodified PNA) and readily penetrate cell membranes without requiring any special delivery agents. This study not only demonstrates the practicality of the proposed post-synthetic modification approach for PNA modification, which could be readily applied to other systems, but also opens up opportunities for using pyrrolidinyl PNA in various applications such as intracellular RNA sensing, specific gene detection, and antisense and antigene therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85026253910,"This study presents an investigation of the effects of cement addition to expansive clay on its deformation characteristics and stress responses during swelling. The effects were evaluated by focusing on the unconfined compressive strength, swelling-shrinkage strains under various conditions, and the lateral coefficient of earth pressure during one-dimensional deformation for artificial mixtures of two different clays at three different ratios. The clays used in this study were a Na-montmorillonite bentonite and a non-expansive Bangkok clay, mixed at different proportions to simulate naturally encountered expansive clays with different degrees of swelling potential. The experimental programme involved unconfined compression, areal shrinkage strain by unconfined drying, vertical free swelling strain, and confined swelling pressure tests. The experimental results show that the cement addition led to marked decreases in the areal shrinkage strain and vertical free swelling strain in addition to the obvious improvement of strength and stiffness of soils. The confined swelling pressure test results indicated that the cement had a greater effect in reducing vertical swelling pressure than the lateral swelling pressure of the soils during one-dimensional swelling. The measured lateral coefficient of earth pressure and stress paths of untreated and cement-treated soils and their engineering implications are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85026900585,"Structure of high density poly ethylene (HDPE) was changed after Plasma-induced graft polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer onto HDPE. Continuous polymerization of monomer wetted HDPE pellets was carried out sequentially via in-line plasma pretreatment followed by reactive extrusion. It was influenced by plasma pretreatment times between 15 s and 120 s on degree of grafting and molecular structure of the extrudate. Maximum degree of grafting was limited to 6% after 30 s plasma pretreatment. The addition of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) increased the degree of grafting to 10% after 15 s of plasma treatment. Gel formation to levels in the range 3–5% was detected, increasing with plasma pretreatment time. The formation of long chain branched (LCB) architecture, of the extruded PMMA-g-HDPE, was confirmed by rheological test in oscillatory shear, which results in increases in low frequency storage and loss moduli and melt viscosity than that of neat HDPE, especially after DCP addition. Finally, formation of a fully crosslinked structure was observed after annealing at 210 °C for 1 h as evidenced by a change in rheological properties at lowest frequencies to solid-like behaviour. Such extensive crosslinking could be useful in producing high strength adhesive joints between HDPE and other materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85020460389,"In males, oxytocin is involved with various physiological functions, such as reproductive tract contractility and testicular steroidogenesis. Due to the relationship between sex steroid hormones, oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression and cryptorchidism pathogenesis, this study aimed to investigate the mRNA expression and the localization of OTR in relation to sex steroid receptors in the male reproductive tract of both normal and unilateral abdominal cryptorchid dogs using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Male dogs were divided into two groups of normal and cryptorchid dogs. Samples from each cryptorchid dog were separated into two subgroups: scrotal and abdominal subgroups. The results showed that a lower percentage of positive OTR immunostaining in the testis and epididymis was observed in the cryptorchid group compared to the normal group. Within the cryptorchid group, the mRNA expression and the localization of OTR in the testis and epididymis of the abdominal subgroup was less than that of the scrotal subgroup. Moreover, the localization of OTR and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in reproductive tissues was positively correlated only in the normal group and not in the cryptorchid group. In conclusion, this study proposed that OTR expression, as well as the correlation between the OTR and ERβ in reproductive tissues of male dogs, can be disturbed by cryptorchidism. Furthermore, the OTR, ERβ and their correlation may be involved with the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism. Therefore, the study of gene knockout models to confirm the effect of OTR and sex steroid receptors on canine cryptorchidism should be of interest for further investigation. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85022020414,"Hypercholesterolaemia is well known to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, subsequently leading to multiple organ failure. Similar to other natural products, sericin is a candidate for adjunctive therapy in hyperlipidaemic conditions. However, the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of sericin are multifactorial and controversial. Here, a high-cholesterol-fed rat model with or without sericin treatment was established using a dosage of 1000 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Blood lipid profiles, oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase, SOD; malondialdehyde, MDA; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor, Nrf-2), dysmorphic mitochondria in relation to fission (dynamin-related protein-1; Drp-1) and fusion (guanosine triphosphatase mutated in dominant optic atrophy; OPA-1) markers and biosynthetic markers (aquaporin, AQP-1; tubulin-4β, Tb4B) in the pancreas and adrenal gland were evaluated. The results showed that sericin reduced blood cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by acting against oxidative stress. Hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant conditions further preserved heart and liver mitochondrial architecture; however, this protection was not exhibited in the kidney, where a high level of renal mitophagy, indicating by LC-3 up-regulation, was presented. The steps of ultrastructural alteration of mitochondria from degenerative changes to necrosis were also demonstrated. Sericin also conserved AQP-1 and Tb4B levels in the exocrine pancreatic acinar cells and zona glomerulosa cells, which were positively correlated with serum lipase, HDL, antioxidative markers and mitochondrial integrity. The present study revealed that sericin not only has antioxidant capacity but also balances pancreatic and adrenal cell biosynthesis, especially lipase activity, which may have played an important role in improving lipid dysregulation in the hypercholesterolaemic rat model, leading to the reduction of dysmorphic mitochondria, particularly in the heart and liver. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85020015122,"Due to its highest conductivity of any oxide material, the delta phase of Bi2O3 (δ-Bi2O3) is recognized as one of the most technologically important materials for various applications, including photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the δ-Bi2O3 phase is not stable at room temperature. Herein, we demonstrate that δ-Bi2O3 can be synthesized at low temperature through a facile sol-gel route in the presence of metavanadate oxyanion (VO3−). The chemical state and local structure of V are investigated by synchrotron-based techniques, such as X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Our findings demonstrate the critical role of VO3− in stabilizing the δ-Bi2O3 phase. The crystallinity of δ-Bi2O3 is dramatically increased by the addition of VO3−. In the absence of VO3−, amorphous product is obtained. The as-synthesized δ-Bi2O3 possesses 3D hierarchical nanostructures constructed by ultrathin nanosheets with a few nanometers thick (~ 5 nm). The nanosheets are composed of ultrasmall nanoparticles in the range of 1–2 nm in size. Such a unique hierarchitecture of δ-Bi2O3 allows efficient light utilization due to multiple reflections and scattering, indicated by its excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation and mineralization of atrazine in aqueous solution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019633914,"In this paper, we exploited a unique reaction of silver ions to create and design urchin-like gold microstructures (UL-AuMSs) with controllable length of nanothorns. The UL-AuMSs were synthesized via a simple one-pot synthetic protocol without using any surface capping agents or polymeric stabilizers. The reactants consisted of tetrachloroauric (III) acid, silver nitrate, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 functioned as the sole reducing agent while trace silver ions played an important role as the shape controlling agent. Without trace silver ions, quasi-sphere gold microstructures (QS-AuMSs) were obtained. The time-dependent SEM investigations corroborated that UL-AuMSs and QS-AuMSs grew from flower-like gold microstructures (FL-AuMSs). The added trace silver ions reacted with physically adsorbed chloride ions on gold surfaces and formed into solid silver chloride capable of altering the dendritic growth of QS-AuMSs to the dominated trunk-growth of UL-AuMSs. The cleaned UL-AuMSs with average thorn lengths of 166 and 187 nm expressed high SERS activity as 0.1 nM of Rhodamine 6G could be detected with a short 15-min incubation.

2-s2.0-85020398202,"Estrous synchronization with progesterone based protocols has been essentially used in cattle industry. Although intravaginal devices have been commonly used, this technique may induce vaginitis. This study aimed at examining the efficiency of novel transdermal progestin patch on follicle development and comparing the progestin patch versus CIDR device on estrous synchronization, complication at treated site and pregnancy in beef cattle. In experiment 1, seven beef cows were treated with an adhesive transdermal progestin patch on the ventral surface of the proximal part of the tail for 7 days. The cows were daily examined the follicular development using ultrasonography starting on Day 0 till 3 days after hormone removal. Experiment 2, forty beef cows were divided into two equal groups (20 cows per group). The cows randomly allocated to received either vaginal insertion of CIDR (n = 20) or treated with an adhesive transdermal progestin patch (n = 20). The levels of plasma progesterone during the experiment and the numbers of standing estrous cows were recorded. Timed artificial inseminated (TAI) was performed at 60 h after CIDR or patch termination. Pregnancy rates were determined at 60 days after TAI. Experiment 1 revealed that the novel transdermal progestin patch could efficiently control follicular growth. All the seven treated cows had dominant follicle upon dermal patch removal indicating the effectiveness of the progestin patch. In experiment 2, the percentages of cows exhibited standing estrus were similar between transdermal patch (72.22%) and CIDR (70.00%). The levels of plasma progesterone during CIDR treatment were significantly higher (4.06 ± 1.65 ng/mL on Day 1 and 3.62 ± 1.60 ng/mL on Day 7) compared with transdermal patch (2.60 ± 1.43 ng/mL on Day 1 and 1.81 ± 1.57 ng/mL on Day 7). Three cows treated with CIDR (15%) developed vaginitis while none of cows had physically dermal reaction at adhesive site. Cows synchronized with these two protocols had similar pregnancy rates (50.00%) following fixed time artificial insemination. It is concluded that transdermal progestin patch was equally effective in estrus synchronization as compared with traditional CIDR. However, the transdermal patch demonstrated less complication. This device should therefore be considered as an alternative method for estrus synchronization in postpartum beef cattle. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

2-s2.0-85018724519,"Provenance analysis and U–Pb dating of detrital zircons in Permian–Triassic forearc sediments from the Sukhothai Arc in northern Thailand clarify the evolution of a missing arc system associated with Paleo-Tethys subduction. The turbidite-dominant formations within the forearc sediments include the Permian Ngao Group (Kiu Lom, Pha Huat, and Huai Thak formations), the Early to earliest Late Triassic Lampang Group (Phra That and Hong Hoi formations), and the Late Triassic Song Group (Pha Daeng and Wang Chin formations). The sandstones are quartzose in the Pha Huat, Huai Thak, and Wang Chin formations, and lithic wacke in the Kiu Lom, Phra That, Hong Hoi and Pha Daeng formations. The quartzose sandstones contain abundant quartz, felsic volcanic and plutonic fragments, whereas the lithic sandstones contain mainly basaltic to felsic volcanic fragments. The youngest single-grain (YSG) zircon U–Pb age generally approximates the depositional age in the study area, but in the case of the limestone-dominant Pha Huat Formation the YSG age is clearly older. On the other hand, the youngest cluster U–Pb age (YC1σ) represents the peak of igneous activity in the source area. Geological evidence, geochemical signatures, and the YC1σ ages of the sandstones have allowed us to reconstruct the Sukhothai arc evolution. The initial Sukhothai Arc (Late Carboniferous–Early Permian) developed as a continental island arc. Subsequently, there was general magmatic quiescence with minor I-type granitic activity during the Middle to early Late Permian. In the latest Permian to early Late Triassic, the Sukhothai Arc developed in tandem with Early to Middle Triassic I-type granitic activity, Middle to Late Triassic volcanism, evolution of an accretionary complex, and an abundant supply of sediments from the volcanic rocks to the trench through a forearc basin. Subsequently, the Sukhothai Arc became quiescent as the Paleo-Tethys closed after the Late Triassic. In addition, parts of sediments of supposed Devonian–Carboniferous age within the Sukhothai Arc were revised as the Triassic Lampang Group, and the Early Cretaceous Khorat Group. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

It uses boosted decision trees to combine information on the global event and jet properties to distinguish between tt¯tt¯ and tt¯ production. The number of events observed after all selection requirements is consistent with expectations from background and standard model signal predictions, and an upper limit is set on the cross section for tt¯tt¯ production in the standard model of 94 fb at 95% confidence level (10.2 × the prediction), with an expected limit of 118 fb. This is combined with the results from the published CMS search in the same-sign dilepton channel, resulting in an improved limit of 69 fb at 95% confidence level (7.4 × the prediction), with an expected limit of 71 fb.

2-s2.0-85029422056,"Tool use has allowed humans to become one of the most successful species. However, tool-assisted foraging has also pushed many of our prey species to extinction or endangerment, a technology-driven process thought to be uniquely human. Here, we demonstrate that tool-assisted foraging on shellfish by long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, reduces prey size and prey abundance, with more pronounced effects where the macaque population size is larger. We compared availability, sizes and maturation stages of shellfish between two adjacent islands inhabited by different-sized macaque populations and demonstrate potential effects on the prey reproductive biology. We provide evidence that once technological macaques reach a large enough group size, they enter a feedback loop - driving shellfish prey size down with attendant changes in the tool sizes used by the monkeys. If this pattern continues, prey populations could be reduced to a point where tool-assisted foraging is no longer beneficial to the macaques, which in return may lessen or extinguish the remarkable foraging technology employed by these primates. © Luncz et al."

The possible mechanism of the effect of exercise on relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms and smoking craving is including affect, biological, and cognitive hypotheses. Evidence suggests that different types of exercise have different effects on these mechanisms. Therefore, type of exercise might have effect on smoking cessation. The purpose of this study is to systematically review randomized controlled trials to gain insight into which types of exercise are effective for smoking cessation. Methods: Publications were systemically searched up to November 2016 in several databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, PEDro, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library), using the following keywords: ""physical activity"", ""exercise"", ""smoking"", ""tobacco"" and ""cigarette"". The methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the type of exercise on smoking cessation. The quality of the evidence was assessed and rated according to the GRADE approach. Results: 20 articles on 19 studies were judged to meet the selection criteria (seven low-risk of bias RCTs and 12 high-risk of bias RCTs). The findings revealed low quality evidence for the effectiveness of yoga for smoking cessation at the end of the treatment. The evidence found for no effect of aerobic exercise, resisted exercise, and a combined aerobic and resisted exercise program on smoking cessation was of low to moderate quality. Furthermore, very low to low quality evidence was found for no effect of physical activity on smoking cessation. Conclusions: There was no effect of aerobic exercise, resisted exercise, physical activity and combined aerobic and resisted exercise on smoking cessation. There was a positive effect on smoking cessation at the end of treatment in the program where yoga plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was used.

The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2fb−1. The event selection requires one muon and two jets where one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Several kinematic variables are then combined into a multivariate discriminator to distinguish signal from background events. A fit to the distribution of the discriminating variable yields a total cross section of 238±13(stat)±29(syst) pb and a ratio of top quark and top antiquark production of Rt-ch.=1.81±0.18(stat)±0.15(syst). From the total cross section the absolute value of the CKM matrix element Vtb is calculated to be 1.05±0.07(exp)±0.02(theo). All results are in agreement with the standard model predictions. © 2017 The Author(s)
2-s2.0-85029381575,"Synthesis of base metal catalysts with well-defined structure and morphology is highly desired to achieve high catalytic performance for clean energy and green chemistry applications. However, in most catalyst synthesis, it is challenging to control structural manipulation at the nanoscale, especially for transition-metal nitrides, because they are often thermodynamically unfavorable at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we report a high-pressure approach for the formation of hexagonal δ-MoN nanocrystals with a unique onion-like morphology. The onion layers are made of stacked zigzag Mo-N shells associated with the (101) crystallographic plane. Impressively, the as-synthesized δ-MoN possesses intrinsic catalytic activities that are twice higher than the traditional MoS2 for hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene and more than five times higher in the selectivity to hydrogenation. The nitride is also highly active for selective hydrogenation of diverse nitroarenes to anilines at mild conditions. The enhanced catalytic properties are presumably attributed to the unique zigzag Mo-N bonding structure of the nitride. This work demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis is a viable approach to design and fabricate new and cost-effective transition-metal nitride catalysts for diverse hydrogenation applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85026288601,"The conversion of waste into high-value materials is considered an important sustainability strategy in modern chemical industries. A large volume of shell waste is generated globally from mussel cultivation. In this work, mussel shell waste (Perna viridis) is transformed into individual calcium carbonate plates (ICCPs) and is applied as a support for a heterogeneous catalyst. Palladium nanoparticles (3–6 nm) are deposited with an even dispersion on the ICCP surface, as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Using this system, Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between aryl iodides and terminal acetylenes were accomplished in high yields with the use of 1 % Pd/ICCP in the presence of potassium carbonate without the use of any copper metal or external ligand. The Pd/ICCP catalyst could also be reused up to three times and activity over 90 % was maintained with negligible Pd-metal leaching. This work demonstrates that mussel shell waste can be used as an inexpensive and effective support for metal catalysts in coupling reactions, as demonstrated by the successful performance of the Pd-catalyzed, copper-free Sonogashira cross-coupling process. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85019133374,"Fluorine-containing copolybenzoxazines were successfully prepared by reacting bisphenol-AF/aniline-based benzoxazine resin (BAF-a) with 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) in N,N-dimethylacetamide solvent. The dielectric and thermal properties as well as flexibility of the resulting copolymer films were investigated. The incorporation of fluorine groups into polybenzoxazine was found to substantially decrease the dielectric constant of the resulting copolybenzoxazine to as low as 2.6. The formation of ester linkages between the hydroxyl groups in the poly(BAF-a) and the carbonyl groups in the 6FDA resulted in substantially enhanced flexibility of the copolybenzoxazines. Moreover, the copolymers showed superior degradation temperature and significant improvement in char yield, up to 464 °C and 56%, respectively. The glass-transition temperature of the copolybenzoxazines was increased with increasing dianhydride content and exhibited a maximum value of 290 °C at 2.5/1 mole ratio of poly(BAF-a) to 6FDA. Therefore, the fluorine-containing dianhydride-modified polybenzoxazines are appropriate for applications as polymeric films for coatings and as a good electrical insulation material with high thermal resistance. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2-s2.0-85022040630,"The interplay between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus and immune cells has been extensively studied for years, as host immune components are thought to play significant roles in promoting the systemic spread of the virus and responsible for cytokine storm. Previous studies suggested that the interaction of B cells and monocytes could promote HPAI H5N1 infection by enhancing avian influenza virus receptor expression. In this study, we further investigate the relationship between the HPAI H5N1 virus, activated B cells, and DC-SIGN expression. DC-SIGN has been described as an important factor for mediating various types of viral infection. Here, we first demonstrate that HPAI H5N1 infection could induce an activation of B cells, which was associated with DC-SIGN expression. Using CD40L and recombinant IL-4 for B cell stimulation, we determined that DC-SIGN expressed on activated B cells was able to enhance its susceptibility to HPAI H5N1 infection. Our findings uncover the interplay between this H5N1 virus and B cells and provide important information in understanding how the virus overcomes our immune system, contributing to its unusual immunopathogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85018703824,"In this study, three kinds of antiseptics which were 0.05% chlorhexidine, 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), or 200 ppm silver nanoparticle was introduced to incorporate in the sericin-based scaffold to produce the antimicrobial dressing for the treatment of infected chronic wound. The effects of antiseptic incorporation on the stability, release of sericin, and short-term and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial activity of the sericin dressing against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated. We showed that the incorporation of each antiseptic did not have significant effect on the internal morphology (pore size ~ 73–105 μm), elasticity (Young’s modulus ~ 200–500 kPa), and the sericin release behavior of the sericin-based dressing. The release of sericin from the dressing was prolonged over 120 h and thereafter. Comparing among three antiseptics, 0.05% chlorhexidine incorporated in the sericin dressing showed the highest immediate and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial effect (largest inhibition zone) against most bacteria either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The in vivo safety test following ISO10993 standard (Biological evaluation of medical devices–Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation) confirmed that the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine did not irritate to tissue, comparing with the commercial material used generally in clinic (Allevyn®, Smith & Nephew). We suggested the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine for the treatment of infected chronic wound. Chlorhexidine would reduce the risk of infection while the sericin may promote wound healing. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Addition of hexabromoacetone further reduced the reaction time and UV irradiation also accelerated the formation of dithianes, yielding 95% of 1,3-dithiane in only 1 min. Aromatic aldehydes or ketoneswith electron-donating substituents at the ortho or para position increased the yield of the corresponding dithianes, while electron-withdrawing group decelerated the reaction.

2-s2.0-85038213703,"Objectives: There are increasing reports of younger children accessing media and screen. This study aims to describe screen use in pre-school children and its association with externalising problems. Methods: A cross-sectional study of pre-schoolers aged two to five years was conducted. Their caregivers were asked to provide data regarding screen use by their children and themselves. The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was completed by caregivers to assess their child’s behaviour. Results: Participants included 200 caregivers of pre-school children. There were 47% of pre-schoolers who had used at least three types of media. When comparing the 0–1, >1 to 2, and >2 hours per day of screen viewing time groups, the children who had experienced more screen time also had significantly more background media and their caregivers had more screen time (p < 0.001). The externalising problem scores increased with more screen viewing time, although the relationship was not statistically significant. However, age and gender of the child were factors associated with externalising problems from the multiple linear regression analysis (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Pre-schoolers with more screen viewing time did not have a significantly greater externalising problem score than those with less screen time. A longitudinal study with a larger sample size would provide more information. © 2017 NISC Pty Ltd."
2-s2.0-85110702830,"Objective: To obtain the adequate surgical anesthesia from thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB), identifying the correct thoracic spine level is mandatory. Ultrasound has become a recent standard to perform regional anesthesia including TPVB. This study aimed to investigate two techniques of using ultrasound to identify C7 spinous process compared with the palpation method. Material and Method: Twenty volunteers were invited to participate in the investigation. Each volunteer was evaluated using palpation method with flexion and extension maneuver, ultrasound transverse scan (US-TS) and parasagittal scan (US-PS) to identify C7 spinous process. All volunteers were scanned on both sides randomly, and finally checked with fluoroscope. The examinations were independently performed by different investigators. The invisible marker pen was used to locate C7 spinous process from each technique. The accuracy and frequency of identified level, both correction and errors, were recorded and compared. Results: The accuracy of palpation method with flexion and extension maneuver for C7 spinous process identification was 72.5%. While identifications of C7 by using US-TS and US-PS were correct 52.5% and 30% respectively. Interestingly, most errors were one level higher than actual C7 spinous process. Conclusion: Identifying C7 spinous process using ultrasound assisted, both US-TS and US-PS techniques had a lower accuracy compared with palpation method with flexion and extension maneuver. Thus, the technique of ultrasound assisted C7 spinous process identification need to be modified. © 2017 Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."

Fish samples were collected every two months between May 2012 and July 2013. Body tissue and viscera of fish were examined for domoic acid content using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results demonstrated contamination in all samples of S. canaliculatus, S. albella and R. brachysoma, with domoic acid content ranging between 0.32 and 48.64, ND-61.43, and ND-84.80 ng·g-1 in body tissues, and between 51.66 and 276.29, 7.93 and 235.00, and 2.19 and 283.50 ng·g-1 in the viscera, respectively. Domoic acid content of S. canaliculatus was higher than R. brachysoma and S. albella. Average contents of domoic acid in S. canaliculatus and R. brachysoma during the dry season were significantly higher than during the wet season. Overall results indicated that the average domoic acid content in the body tissue of all fish sampled throughout the year was 13.91% (19.94 ng·g-1 wet weight); with domoic acid in the viscera of 152.54 ng·g-1 wet weight, an eight-fold increase.

2-s2.0-84948765858,"The need for empirical research on leadership in educational organizations across more diverse national settings frames the purpose of the current study of principal leadership in Vietnam. To date, the international literature on school leadership in Vietnam is virtually a blank slate. This research aimed at describing how Vietnamese school principals enact their leadership roles and analysing how the observed patterns of leadership practice are shaped by the Vietnamese context. In this study, we frame the ‘context of school leadership’ in Vietnam in terms of Confucian sociocultural values of the Vietnamese society and the institutional-political structures within which education is delivered. The study employed phenomenological research methods in a multi-site case study design. Qualitative methods of interview, observation and document analysis were employed to generate a thick description of how principal leadership was enacted in three schools in Vietnam. The study found that in this context, effective school leadership integrated elements associated with strong autocratic and moral leadership.

Six distinct land use types are present in the watershed including five that are under cultivation and one is forest. Surface soil samples were collected from 24 sites for chemical analyses with results interpreted using statistics. Level of nitrate (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) were decreasing in both times whereas ammonia (NH4-N) and available phosphorus (AP) were slightly increase. Soil nitrogen showed significantly difference for both times whereas significant differences among land use categories were found for AP.

Profenofos degradation by Pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain PF1 (PF1) under environmental influence was characterized using response surface methodology with central composite design method. The models were applied to investigate the effects of key environmental parameters including pH, temperature, and initial profenofos concentration on profenofos biodegradation performance based on the profenofos biodegradation kinetic rates. The result showed that profenofos removal percentages by PF1 at the different initial concentrations (5–20 mg L–1) were 50%–90% with the utilization rates of 0.17–0.78 mg L–1 h–1. The biodegradation kinetic rates well fit the first-order kinetic equation. The kinetic rates increased with rising of pHs and profenofos concentrations. The optimum levels of the key parameters were pH of 5.89, temperature of 32.94°C, and profenofos concentration of 20.15 mg L–1 with the highest profenofos biodegradation kinetic rates of 0.10 h–1. The interaction between pH and profenofos concentration obviously impacted the profenofos biodegradation kinetic rates. © 2017 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85038252750,"The Joint Inspection Group (JIG) standard for aviation fuel quality management assists in the operational process and maintenance of aviation fuel from its point of origin and through distribution systems to airports. Currently, problems arise as the JIG standard and quality management in aviation fuel are isolated and have independent procedures. Merging the JIG standards with ISO 9001:2015 can override original JIG’s philosophy by connecting all quality assessment, and management parties involved, throughout the supply chain. This integration can harmonize auditing tasks, focusing on risk/opportunity, and continue quality improvement focus. This paper proposes a development of quality management system (QMS) under ISO 9001:2015 for aviation fuelling service in a systematic way. The content and critical success factors of ISO 9001:2015 and JIG standards were studied. The beneficial synergies, similarities, and logical linkages between both standards are identified. This QMS was developed in the largest petroleum company in Thailand and 60 selected experts were surveyed, with a response rate of 88.3%, for their agreement on integrated criteria. Two external quality auditors, who have ISO 9001 and JIG expertise, were interviewed to modify our initial proposed QMS. The final QMS was implemented in the into-plane fuelling services as the first phase of this implementation. Results of framework implementation are discussed in a case study. There are mutual benefits resulting from the integration of JIG and ISO 9001:2015 standards. This QMS provides a unified process for quality management practices, and enhances the effectiveness of risk evaluation as well as the opportunity for continued quality improvement. It facilitates the identification of ISO 9001:2015 requirements and establishes relationships between the roles of JIG standard and the clauses of ISO 9001:2015. The first experience from five airports as the pilot study of proposed QMS implementation minimized conflicts and duplications between JIG and ISO 9001:2015 standards, reduced the number of into-plane fuelling service incidents reported, such as oil spill, machine stoppage, re-inspections, and recall costs."

2-s2.0-85034051295,"Mathematical literacy plays an important role as one of life skills. It is a fundamental skill which is as necessary as literacy. Therefore, mathematics teaching in schools must aim to develop mathematical literacy and to enhance each students' ability to use and apply mathematical knowledge in order to solve real life problems or situations. According to Realistic Mathematics Education, real world problems are used as a source or a starting point for learning and developing mathematical concepts. Students should have the opportunity to build their own mathematical knowledge through the teacher's guidance. The DAPIC problem-solving process consists of five elements which make up its acronym, namely (1) define, (2) assess, (3) plan, (4) implement, and (5) communicate. Realistic mathematics education and the DAPIC problem-solving process should be collaboratively used to develop students' mathematical literacy. This study was based on research and development design. The main purposes of this study were to develop an instructional process for enhancing mathematical literacy among students in secondary school and to study the effects of the developed instructional process on mathematical literacy. The instructional process was developed by analyzing and synthesizing realistic mathematics education and the DAPIC problem-solving process. The developed instructional process was verified by experts and was trialed. The designated pre-test/post-test control method was used to study the effectiveness of the developed instructional process on mathematical literacy. The sample consisted of 104 ninth grade students from a secondary school in Bangkok, Thailand. The developed instructional process consisted of five steps, namely (1) posing real life problems, (2) solving problems individually or in a group, (3) presenting and discussing, (4) developing formal mathematics, and (5) applying knowledge. The mathematical literacy of the experimental group was significantly higher after being taught through the instructional process.

2-s2.0-85034030916,"This paper studied cultural hybridization as reflected in hero characters from 30 Thai action adventure films produced and released during 1997–2010. It was hypothesized that the characterization of the heroes in the action adventure films in question had been influenced by features of heroes in foreign films. Such features had been mixed with Thai values and local beliefs so as to create Thai hybrid hero characters. These hybrid characters demonstrated the distinctiveness and dynamics of Thai action adventure films. It was found that cultural hybridization is presented through the Thai hero characters' images, gender identity, and roles leading to the emergence of three important types of Thai hybrid hero: 1) local Thai cowboy heroes, 2) Thai martial arts heroes, and 3) Thai necromancer superheroes. These heroes are clear evidence of an adaptation and cultural hybridization between international films' hero characters and certain elements in Thai society being legends, local beliefs, and the values of masculinity. Moreover, these hybrid heroes reflect the flow of globalization into Thai society and the process of localization to creatively respond to the flux in global culture. © 2017"

2-s2.0-85034980716,"SMOTE is an effective oversampling technique for a class imbalance problem due to its simplicity and relatively high recall value. One drawback of SMOTE is a requirement of the number of nearest neighbors as a key parameter to synthesize instances. This paper introduces a new adaptive algorithm called Adaptive neighbor Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (ANS) to dynamically adapt the number of neighbors needed for oversampling around different minority regions. This technique also defines a minority outcast as a minority instance having no minority class neighbors. Minority outcasts are neglected by most oversampling techniques but instead, an additional outcast handling method is proposed for the performance improvement via a 1-nearest neighbor model. Based on our experiments in UCI and PROMISE datasets, generated datasets from this technique have improved the accuracy performance of a classification, and the improvement can be verified statistically by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. © 2017, Prince of Songkla University.

The Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Dental Councils have proposed the ""Common Major Competencies for ASEAN General Dental Practitioners"" to harmonize undergraduate dental education. This article discusses how the ASEAN competencies were developed and established to assist the development of general dental practitioners with comparable knowledge, skills, and attitudes across ASEAN. The competencies were developed through four processes: A questionnaire about current national oral health problems, a two-round Delphi process that sought agreement on competencies, a panel discussion by representatives from ASEAN Dental Councils, and data verification by the representatives after the meeting. Key themes of the ASEAN competencies were compared with the competencies from the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan. A total of 33 competency statements, consistent with other regions, were agreed upon and approved. Factors influencing the ASEAN competencies and their implementation include oral health problems in ASEAN, new knowledge and technology in dentistry, limited institutional resources, underregulated dental schools, and uneven distribution of dental practitioners. The ASEAN competencies will serve as the foundation for further developments in ASEAN dental education including policy development, curriculum revision, quality assurance, and staff development.

2-s2.0-85031118040,"Recently, we introduced an approach for more easily interpreting searches for resonances at the LHC-A nd to aid in distinguishing between realistic and unrealistic alternatives for potential signals. This ""simplified limits"" approach was derived using the narrow width approximation (NWA)-A nd therefore was not obviously relevant in the case of wider resonances. Here, we broaden the scope of the analysis. First, we explicitly generalize the formalism to encompass resonances of finite width. We then examine how the width of the resonance modifies bounds on new resonances that are extracted from LHC searches. Second, we demonstrate, using a wide variety of cases, with different incoming partons, resonance properties, and decay signatures, that the limits derived in the NWA yield pertinant, and somewhat conservative (less stringent) bounds on the model parameters. We conclude that the original simplified limits approach is useful in the early stages of evaluating and interpreting new collider data and that the generalized approach is a valuable further aid when evidence points toward a broader resonance. © 2017 American Physical Society."

Assisted reproductive techniques, therefore, are necessary to overcome these issues and maintain the genetic diversity in the captive population. The objective was to use laparoscopic oviductal artificial insemination (AI) to breed genetically valuable females (n = 4; aged 4.5-5 yr) that were unsuccessfully paired. Fecal hormone metabolites (estrogen and progesterone) were extracted and measured by enzyme immunoassay for monitoring of ovarian activity 45 days before and 65 days after laparoscopic AI. For timed insemination, females were injected with 200 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin and 1,000 IU porcine luteinizing hormone (pLH) at the 82-hr interval. Ovarian assessment was performed by laparoscopy 44 hr after pLH administration. One nulliparous female out of four presented two ovulation sites on each ovary. The single female that had ovulated was inseminated with chilled semen collected from two males (8 × 10 6 and 2.7 × 10 6 motile spermatozoa, respectively, in each oviduct). A significant increase in fecal progesterone concentrations was observed after AI with a concentration peak (500 μg/g dry feces) detected on day 24 after pLH injection, which was then sustained for more than 45 days after the pLH injection. The delivery of two cubs occurred on day 92 after pLH. Microsatellite marker analysis determined that both cubs were sired by the same male.

The Hamiltonian systems obtained by this decoupling display remarkable periodic return behaviors closely analogous to what has been demonstrated in recent literature for a few other related equations (the cubic Szegő equation, the conformal flow, the LLL equation). This suggests a powerful underlying analytic structure, such as integrability. We comment on the connection of our considerations to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85029009744,"Background The mechanism by which various classes of medication reduce COPD exacerbation risk remains unknown. We hypothesized a correlation between reduced exacerbation risk and improvement in airway patency as measured according to FEV1. Methods By systematic review, COPD trials were identified that reported therapeutic changes in predose FEV1 (dFEV1) and occurrence of moderate to severe exacerbations. Using meta-regression analysis, a model was generated with dFEV1 as the moderator variable and the absolute difference in exacerbation rate (RD), ratio of exacerbation rates (RRs), or hazard ratio (HR) as dependent variables. Results The analysis of RD and RR included 119,227 patients, and the HR analysis included 73,475 patients. For every 100-mL change in predose FEV1, the HR decreased by 21% (95% CI, 17-26; P <.001; R2 = 0.85) and the absolute exacerbation rate decreased by 0.06 per patient per year (95% CI, 0.02-0.11; P =.009; R2 = 0.05), which corresponded to an RR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81-0.91; P <.001; R2 = 0.20). The relationship with exacerbation risk remained statistically significant across multiple subgroup analyses. Conclusions A significant correlation between increased FEV1 and lower COPD exacerbation risk suggests that airway patency is an important mechanism responsible for this effect. © 2017 American College of Chest Physicians"
2-s2.0-85029682396,"Metaphire peguana (Megascolecidae) is a terrestrial earthworm that was found to be widely distributed throughout the whole of Penang state during our field collecting. The differences in the average length and diameter of M. peguana between the island and mainland Penang population were correlated with their behavior and the environmental parameters of the biotope and soil type, pH and moisture content. Principle component analysis of the correlation matrix and dendrogram for M. peguana revealed significant differences in how the types of biotope and environmental factors may affect the size of M. peguana. Morphometric variations in M. peguana did not reflect any genetic difference. Concisely morphometric variation across different types of biotopes, combined with relatively low levels of gene flow, is expected to favor local adaptation of M. peguana. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"

2-s2.0-85029485245,"We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at zCO = 3.6314 discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACS J0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), optical, far-infrared (FIR), millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO emission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8+ 0.5-1.0 × 109M⊙, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8+ 1.2-0.6 × 1011L⊙. By combining the stretching effect of the lens with the high angular resolution imaging of the CO(1-0) line emission and the radio continuum at 5 GHz, we find that the bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust, but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least up to J = 6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower. This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Indeed, the respective CO-to-H2 conversion factors as derived from the correlation with metallicity and the FIR dust continuum can only be reconciled if excitation is accounted for. The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed between z 1.5 and z 2.5. © ESO, 2017."
2-s2.0-85028414414,"The decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported in alcohol use disorder and major depression. The effective treatment of these comorbid diseases remains undiscovered. Nutraceutical products are therefore proposed as an alternative approach to overcome this challenge. Ginseng extract G115, the standardized extract of Panax ginseng, is a widely-used nutraceutical that is beneficial for various central nervous system disorders. This study aimed to determine the antidepressant effect of ginseng extract G115 in ethanol-treated mice models. Mice received either water, amitriptyline, or various doses of G115 (p.o.) followed by water or ethanol (i.p.) for 8 days. The antidepressant activity was evaluated using forced swimming test. BDNF levels were measured from hippocampal and prefrontal cortex tissues. The results demonstrated that the increase of immobility time in depressant mice induced by ethanol was reversed by both G115 and amitriptyline treatment. A significant increase of BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was observed in ethanol-treated mice receiving G115. Taken together, this study provides scientific information on the use of G115 as an antidepressant that could be further used as a dietary supplement in comorbid alcohol use and major depressive disorders. © 2017 by the authors.

2-s2.0-85029760921,"A search is presented for massive spin-1 Z′ resonances decaying to a top quark and a heavy vector-like top quark partner T. The search is based on a 2.6 fb−1 sample of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis is optimized for final states in which the T quark decays to a W boson and a bottom quark. The focus is on all-jet final states in which both the W boson and the top quark decay into quarks that evolve into jets. The decay products of the top quark and of the W boson are assumed to be highly Lorentz-boosted and cannot be reconstructed as separate jets, but are instead reconstructed as merged, wide jets. Techniques for the identification of jet substructure and jet flavour are used to distinguish signal from background events. Several models for Z′ bosons decaying to T quarks are excluded at 95% confidence level, with upper limits on the cross section ranging from 0.13 to 10 pb, depending on the chosen hypotheses. This is the first search for a neutral spin-1 heavy resonance decaying to a top quark and a vector-like T quark in the all-hadronic final state. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Sulfonic groups and carboxyl groups were detected on MWCNTs with H2SO4 treatment (s-MWCNTs), while only carboxyl groups were presented from other acid treatments. The catalytic dehydration of D-xylose into furfural was evaluated using a batch reactor at 170 °C for 3 h under N2 pressure of 15 bar. The highest furfural selectivity was achieved around 57% by s-MWCNTs catalyst, suggesting a positive role of the sulfonic functionalized groups. The effect of Co species was related to their Lewis acid property resulting in the enhancement of xylose conversion with low selectivity to furfural product. © 2017 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology ."
2-s2.0-85028425677,"Background: Forced eyelid closure test (FECT) is a clinical screening test developed from the original Cogan lid twitch (CLT) sign to assist in the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG), We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of FECT compared with CLT and benchmarked to standard diagnostic tests. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of 48 patients using electronic medical records of those that presented with ptosis and/or diplopia at Doheny Eye Institute, University of California, Los Angeles between February 2015 and April 2016. Patients without FECT testing were excluded. FECT and CLT results, and final diagnosis were recorded. To perform FECT, the patient was asked to squeeze his or her eyelids shut for 5-10 seconds then open quickly and fixate in primary position. The excessive upward overshoot of eyelids movement indicated a positive FECT. The test was performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist before establishing the diagnosis. Patients who had equivocal test results and/or inconclusive final diagnosis were excluded. Results: Of the 48 patients studied, 18 patients (37.5%) had positive FECT; 15 of whom had a final diagnosis of OMG (83.3%). Of the 30 patients with negative FECT, 1 had OMG (3.3%). Of the 48 patients, 35 patients also had a documented CLT result (72.9%). CLT was positive in 11 of these 35 patients (31.4%), and 9 of these 11 had OMG (81.8%). Of the 24 patients with negative CLT, 2 of them had OMG (8.3%). Sensitivity and specificity of FECT were 94% and 91% (joint 95% confidence region: sensitivity × specificity = [0.70, 1] × [0.75, 1]). The relative true-positive fraction (rTPF) between FECT and CLT was 1.15; the relative false-positive fraction was 1.31.

2-s2.0-85027502404,"NAD (NAD+) is a cofactor related to many cellular processes. This cofactor is known to be unstable, especially at high temperatures, where it chemically decomposes to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. Bacteria, yeast, and higher organisms possess the salvage pathway for reconstructing NAD+ from these decomposition products; however, the importance of the salvage pathway for survival is not well elucidated, except for in pathogens lacking the NAD+ de novo synthesis pathway. Herein, we report the importance of the NAD+ salvage pathway in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 at high temperatures. We identified the gene encoding nicotinamidase (TTHA0328), which catalyzes the first reaction of the NAD+ salvage pathway. This recombinant enzyme has a high catalytic activity against nicotinamide (Km of 17 μM, kcat of 50 s-1, kcat/Km of 3.0 × 103 s-1 · mM-1). Deletion of this gene abolished nicotinamide deamination activity in crude extracts of T. thermophilus and disrupted the NAD+ salvage pathway in T. thermophilus. Disruption of the salvage pathway led to the severe growth retardation at a higher temperature (80°C), owing to the drastic decrease in the intracellular concentrations of NAD+ and NADH. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

2-s2.0-85027586677,"This paper presents an approach of the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm’s performance in fault identification on power transmission lines. The clustering algorithm is incorporated in a scheme that uses hybrid intelligent technique to combine artificial neural network and a fuzzy inference system, known as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The scheme is used to identify the type of fault that occurs on a power transmission line, either single line to ground, double line, double line to ground or three phase. The scheme is also capable an analyzing the fault location without information on line parameters. The range of error estimation is within 0.10 to 0.85 relative to five values of fault resistances. This paper also presents the performance of the GK clustering algorithm compared to fuzzy clustering means (FCM), which is particularly implemented in structuring a data. Results show that the GK algorithm may be implemented in fault identification on power system transmission and performs better than FCM. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers."

2-s2.0-85027254683,"The impact of early ART initiation (versus deferring) on kidney function has not been studied. START was a randomised comparison of immediate versus deferred ART initiation among HIV-positive persons with CD4+ (cells/mm3) counts >500. Serum creatinine and urine dipstick protein were measured at Months 0, 1, 4, 8 and 12, and annually thereafter. The two arms were compared for changes in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2, calculated by CKD-EPI equation), over time using longitudinal mixed models. Of 4685 START participants, 4629 (2294 in immediate and 2335 deferred arm) were included. Median baseline CD4+ and eGFR were 651 and 111.5, respectively. ART was initiated in 2271 participants (99.0%) in the immediate and 1127 (48.3%) in the deferred arm, accounting for >94% and >19% of follow-up time, respectively. Overall, 89% started ART using a tenofovir-based regimen. Over 2.1 years median follow-up, mean eGFR was 0.56 (95% CI 0.003–1.11) higher in the immediate versus deferred arm, which was more prominent after adjustment for current tenofovir or bPI use (1.85, 95% CI 1.21–2.50) and in Black participants (30.1% overall) (3.90, 95% CI 2.84–4.97) versus non-Blacks (1.05, 95% CI 0.33–1.77) (P < 0.001 for interaction). Relative risk for proteinuria in the immediate versus deferred arm was 0.74 (95% CI 0.55–1.00) (P = 0.049). In the short-term, immediate ART initiation was associated with a modestly higher eGFR and lower proteinuria risk versus deferring ART (more pronounced in Black participants).

2-s2.0-85026795255,"Enzyme I (EI) of bacterial phosphotransferase system is involved in the first step of the carbohydrate metabolism pathway. Due to its importance in bacterial survival and low similarity with human proteins, EI is an attractive drug target. With the aid of Computer Aided Drug Designing tools, we studied EI of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which recently adopted itself as a major etiological agent in discerning the cause of multi-drug resistant nosocomial infections of implanted medical devices. Due to a non-existent crystal structure, a high quality homology model of EI is predicted. Molecular docking analysis of potential inhibitors into the active site of the protein is performed and the best inhibitor is selected with according to the highest GoldScore (76.53). The protein-ligand complex was conducted through a 100 ns MD simulation. The trajectory analysis reveals that the N-terminal domain (EIN) and the P-His domain residues exhibited the greatest conformational changes while the active site shows minimum residual fluctuations and is considered as the most stable domain. The rigid body motions of EIN and P-His domain are recorded to be at their highest during the 35th and 83rd ns with highest RMSD values. Despite the highly flexible ‘personality’ of EI, the ligand remains tightly associated with the active site residues. The current lead compound holds potential as an effective drug against S. epidermidis which could be further tested in clinical settings. The dynamic nature of EI disclosed via MD simulation, can be further explored to understand the molecular kinetics of chemical reactions involved in the dedicated role of the protein would assist in better design of drugs in future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

This condition is characterized by abnormal enamel formation caused by gene mutations that alter the quality and/or quantity of enamel. This dental problem can impact both primary and permanent dentition, varies among affected individuals, and results in esthetic and functional problems. This condition caused the patient in the current case report to have a lack of confidence when speaking. The treatment for amelogenesis imperfecta depends on the severity of the problem and age of the patient. It is crucial to plan a proper remedy, which requires collaboration among dental specialties to execute comprehensive dental treatment in order to provide a long-term solution with adequate esthetics. The current clinical study presents a patient affected by AI that was diagnosed when the patient was a child. The interdisciplinary treatment continued throughout his childhood and into adult life. The initial treatment consisted of resin composite veneers and stainless-steel crowns to restore the defective tooth structure.

2-s2.0-85028331344,"This study investigated the influence of battery charge levels on the stability of light-emitting diode (LED) curing-light intensity by measuring the intensity from fully charged through fully discharged batteries. The microhardness of resin composites polymerized by the light-curing units at various battery charge levels was measured. The light intensities of seven fully charged battery LED light-curing units—1) LY-A180, 2) Bluephase, 3) Woodpecker, 4) Demi Plus, 5) Saab II, 6) Elipar S10, and 7) MiniLED—were measured with a radiometer (Kerr) after every 10 uses (20 seconds per use) until the battery was discharged. Ten 2-mm-thick cylindrical specimens of A3 shade nanofilled resin composite (PREMISE, Kerr) were prepared per LED light-curing unit group. Each specimen was irradiated by the fully charged light-curing unit for 20 seconds. The LED light-curing units were then used until the battery charge fell to 50%. Specimens were prepared again as described above. This was repeated again when the light-curing units’ battery charge fell to 25% and when the light intensity had decreased to 400 mW/cm2. The top/bottom surface Knoop hardness ratios of the specimens were determined. The microhardness data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey test at a significance level of 0.05. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine significant correlations between surface hardness and light intensity. We found that the light intensities of the Bluephase, Demi Plus, and Elipar S10 units were stable. The intensity of the MiniLED unit decreased slightly; however, it remained above 400 mW/ cm2. In contrast, the intensities of the LY-A180, Woodpecker, and Saab II units decreased below 400 mW/cm2. There was also a significant decrease in the surface microhardnesses of the resin composite specimens treated with MiniLED, LY-A180, Woodpecker, and Saab II. In conclusion, the light intensity of several LED light-curing units decreased as the battery was discharged, with a coincident reduction in the units’ ability to polymerize resin composite. Therefore, the intensity of an LED light-curing unit should be evaluated during the life of its battery charge to ensure that sufficient light intensity is being generated."
2-s2.0-85025825788,"The single WAP domain-containing protein (SWD) is a type III crustin antimicrobial peptide whose function is to defense the host animal against the bacterial infection by means of antimicrobial and antiproteinase activities. A study of SWD from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvSWD) is reported herein about its activities and function against bacteria, particularly the AHPND-inducing Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) that causes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). The LvSWD is mainly synthesized in hemocytes and up-regulated in response to VPAHPND infection. Over-expressed mature recombinant LvSWD (rLvSWD) and its WAP domain (rLvSWD-WAP) are able to strongly inhibit subtilisin but not trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase. The rLvSWD inhibits subtilisin with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 14.3 nM. However, only rLvSWD exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the rLvSWD, the rLvSWD-WAP does not possess antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the killing effect of rLvSWD on VPAHPND and Bacillus megaterium was studied. The MIC of 30 μM against VPAHPND is bactericidal whereas the MIC against B. megaterium is not. With four times the MIC of rLvSWD, the VPAHPND-treated post larval shrimp are able to survive longer with 50% survival rate as long as 78 h as compared to 36 h of the infected shrimp without rLvSWD. The antimicrobial activity of LvSWD against the VPAHPND infection suggests its potential application for disease control in aquaculture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

History of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis was obtained from 147 volunteers; ear examination was also performed and venous blood was drawn for laboratory analysis. The volunteers then underwent an ultrasonography measurement of the IMT-CCA. In univariate analysis, presence of ATC, age, underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cigarette smoking, low-density lipoprotein, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were significantly associated with the IMT-CCA. Further multivariate analysis confirmed a significant association between the presence of ATC and IMT-CCA, when adjusted for other factors (adjusted βATC =.010, 95% confidence interval: 0.0021-0.019).

In this study, individuals from diverse populations with NS were evaluated clinically and by facial analysis technology. Clinical data and images from 125 individuals with NS were obtained from 20 countries with an average age of 8 years and female composition of 46%. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, and additional/other. Across these different population groups, NS was phenotypically similar with only 2 of 21 clinical elements showing a statistically significant difference. The most common clinical characteristics found in all population groups included widely spaced eyes and low-set ears in 80% or greater of participants, short stature in more than 70%, and pulmonary stenosis in roughly half of study individuals. Using facial analysis technology, we compared 161 Caucasian, African, Asian, and Latin American individuals with NS with 161 gender and age matched controls and found that sensitivity was equal to or greater than 94% for all groups, and specificity was equal to or greater than 90%. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with NS and additionally demonstrate how facial analysis technology can support clinicians in making accurate NS diagnoses.

2-s2.0-85025176685,"Introduction Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment extended broadly to many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, complications may arise during DBS procedures or following implantation due to implanted hardware. This may result in both minor and major adverse events that may necessitate hardware removal and/or compromise maximal therapeutic benefit for the patient. Objectives and methods To identify relevant literature on hardware-related complications from DBS procedures by performing a systematic review, and propose how to identify at-risk group and possible preventive approaches. Results Of 4592 abstract screened, 96 articles fulfilled the selection criteria and were reviewed. Overall, the most common hardware-related complications were infections (5.12% of patients), followed by lead migration (1.60%), fracture or failure of the lead or other parts of the implant (1.46% and 0.73%, respectively), IPG malfunctions (1.06% of patients), and skin erosions without infections (0.48% of patients). New indications for DBS, including Tourette's syndrome, cluster headache, and refractory partial epilepsy, were found to bear a higher incidence of hardware-related infections than established indications such as Parkinson's disease. The highest rate of lead fracture or failure was found in dystonia patients (4.22%). Ultimately, the highest rate of pain at the implantation sites was found in refractory partial epilepsy patients (16.55%). Conclusion Our analysis identified a variety of potential hardware-related complications among patients who underwent DBS procedures. Patients who were at risk of complications, such as patients with dystonia and off-label indications (e.g. Tourette's syndrome) should be informed prior to surgery and closely followed thereafter. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85025096571,"Herein, we report a systematic investigation into the role of particle size of Bi2O3 nanoparticles on their photocatalytic activity. The range of particle size is from 11 to 27 nm. Using degradation and mineralization of atrazine under UVA light as probe reactions, we show that photocatalytic activity is very sensitive to particle size. A slight difference in particle size leads to a significant difference in photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic activity does not linearly increase with increasing particle size. Within 1 h of 2.42 W/m2 UVA irradiation at pH 6, the degradation efficiency for 5 mg/L of atrazine using 1 g/L of Bi2O3 with an average particle size of 11, 16.7, 20.1 and 26.8 nm is 84.9, 87.5, 92.1 and 75.5%, respectively. There is an optimum particle size, which is found to be 20.1 nm, as the best compromise between surface area and surface recombination. With these results, the particle size effect should be really taken into account so as to achieve appreciable performance for further development of photocatalytic system involving Bi2O3. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85022207227,"Emergence of a disease with clinical signs resembling megalocytivirus infection seriously affected large-scale barramundi farms in Vietnam in 2012–2014 with estimated losses reaching $435,810 per year. An oil-based, inactivated vaccine against red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) was applied in one farm for disease prevention without analysis of the causative agent, and the farmer reported inadequate protection. Here we describe histological and molecular analysis of the diseased fish. PCR targeting the major capsid protein (MCP) of megalocytiviruses yielded an amplicon with high sequence identity to infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) genotype II previously reported from other marine fish but not barramundi. Detection of the virus was confirmed by positive in situ hybridization results with fish tissue lesions of the kidney, liver, pancreas, and brain of the PCR-positive samples. Based on the complete sequence of the MCP gene, the isolate showed 95.2% nucleotide sequence identity and 98.7% amino acid sequence identity (6 residue differences) with the MCP of RSIV. Prediction of antigenic determinants for MCP antigens indicated that the 6 residue differences would result in a significant difference in antigenicity of the two proteins. This was confirmed by automated homology modeling in which structure superimpositioning revealed several unique epitopes in the barramundi isolate. This probably accounted for the low efficiency of the RSIV vaccine when tested by the farmer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Method: A search of the literature was performed between January 2000 and June 2015. Existing RA recommendations, in relation to the use of bDMARDs and tsDMARD, were identified and evaluated by the AGREE II instrument prior to their use as a ‘guide’ for developing this TRA recommendation. An additional literature search was performed in order to answer specific clinical questions that could not be found in existing guidelines. Result: Thirteen recommendations were developed. They covered the use of RA classification criteria, the aim of RA treatment, when to initiate bDMARDs/tsDMARD or taper or switch them to other medications, as well as monitoring these drugs during their use. In addition, specific issues including their use and vaccination, malignancies, pregnancy and lactation, and perioperative period also were addressed.

The recommendations were distributed to other professional associations related to RA management, as well as government sectors associated with the reimbursement policy, prior to development of the final version. Conclusion: These recommendations will help Thai rheumatologists prescribe bDMARDs and tsDMARD more appropriately when treating RA patients. © 2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"
2-s2.0-85028680296,"A data sample of events from proton–proton collisions with two isolated same-sign leptons, missing transverse momentum, and jets is studied in a search for signatures of new physics phenomena by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1, and a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV. The properties of the events are consistent with expectations from standard model processes, and no excess yield is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on cross sections for the pair production of gluinos, squarks, and same-sign top quarks, as well as top-quark associated production of a heavy scalar or pseudoscalar boson decaying to top quarks, and on the standard model production of events with four top quarks. The observed lower mass limits are as high as 1500GeV for gluinos, 830GeV for bottom squarks. The excluded mass range for heavy (pseudo)scalar bosons is 350–360 (350–410)GeV. Additionally, model-independent limits in several topological regions are provided, allowing for further interpretations of the results. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."
2-s2.0-85025155884,"Abstract: An ultrafine three-dimensional nanofiber network structure of a very high porosity endows bacterial cellulose (BC) to function as support for heterogeneous catalysis. A novel catalyst of BC supported alumina (Al2O3) was developed by soaking purified BC hydrogel in aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3) aqueous solution, dehydration (hot air drying and freeze-drying) and calcination. The Al/BC catalysts reveal interior meso–macro porous structures with average pore diameters in the range of 17–34 nm. The catalytic activities were examined through an ethanol dehydration reaction in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure in the range of 200–400 °C. The effects of acidic metal loading and dehydration methods were investigated. Increasing Al loading from 12 to 50% resulted in a decreased surface area but an increase in pore size. At the same Al loading, the catalysts with a dehydration process by hot air drying presented higher Al concentrations on the outer surface compared with those by freeze-drying. At high temperature of 400 °C, Al/BC catalysts with 25 wt% Al loading and dehydrated by freeze drying (25Al/BC FD) and 50 wt% Al loading, dehydrated by hot air drying (50Al/BC TD) exhibited the highest ethanol conversions of 65.7–66.4% and ethylene yields of 43.26–44.24%, respectively, whereas at low temperature of 200 °C, Al/BC catalysts with 25 wt% Al loading with either dehydration method exhibited the highest diethyl ether yields of 40.02–41.60%.

2-s2.0-85021255614,"Both HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Because the relative contributions of ART and untreated HIV to BMD loss are unclear, it is important to quantify the effect of ART on bone. We compared the effect of early ART initiation (CD4 >500 cells/μL) with deferred ART on change in BMD in the START Bone Mineral Density substudy, a randomized trial evaluating the effect of immediate ART initiation versus deferring ART (to CD4 <350 cells/μL). BMD was measured annually at the lumbar spine and hip by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Percent change in BMD by treatment assignment (intent-to-treat analysis) was estimated using longitudinal mixed models and linear regression. Baseline and follow-up DXA scans were available for 399 (195 immediate, 204 deferred) participants (median age 32 years, 80% non-white, 26% women, median CD4 count 642 cells/μL). ART (most commonly including tenofovir and efavirenz) was used for 95% and 18% of follow-up in the immediate and deferred ART groups, respectively. Through 2.2 years mean follow-up, immediate ART resulted in greater BMD declines than deferred ART at the hip (–2.5% versus –1.0%; difference –1.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] –2.2 to –0.8, p < 0.001) and spine (–1.9% versus –0.4%; difference –1.6%, 95% CI –2.2 to –1.0, p < 0.001). BMD declines were greatest in the first year of ART. In the immediate ART group, spine BMD stabilized after year 1, whereas hip BMD declined progressively over 2 years. After year 1, BMD changes were similar in the immediate and deferred groups. No clinical, HIV-related, or ART characteristic predicted greater BMD loss in either group. All HIV treatment guidelines now recommend ART initiation at HIV diagnosis because of the reduced risk of serious clinical outcomes. Better understanding of the longer-term consequences of the observed reductions in BMD is needed.

2-s2.0-85021452303,"Potassium carbonate supported on gamma-alumina, which was prepared by impregnation and employed to adsorb carbon dioxide (CO2) under a turbulent fluidized bed regime, could be regenerated by heat treatment. The regeneration temperature and time were varied in the range of 200–300 °C and 2–20 min, respectively. Both parameters had a positive influence on the CO2 adsorption capacity in the subsequent adsorption cycle, while regression analysis showed an interaction between both operating parameters. At a low or high regeneration temperature, increasing the regeneration time reduced the subsequent CO2 adsorption capacity, which was explained by the thermal mass decomposition of sorbent with the major loss of surface water and inter-structural water at 100 °C and 200–400 °C, respectively. Based on the intensity of energy used in the different heat regeneration protocols, the operating parameters were optimized. Regeneration at 300 °C for 20 min led to a subsequent CO2 adsorption capacity of 90.7% of the fresh sorbent, but that at 200 °C for 2 min gave a CO2 adsorption capacity of 57.2% for a 1.8-fold lower regeneration energy. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers"

2-s2.0-85022055488,"This work was performed to test the feasibility of hydrogen (H2) production simultaneously with pollutant removal from biodiesel wastewater by the photocatalytic oxidation via different crystal structure TiO2 photocatalysts at ambient temperature (∼ 30 °C) and pressure. It was found that the simultaneous H2 production and pollutant removal could not be achieved using a fresh biodiesel wastewater, but proceeded well when the wastewater was diluted around 3.3-fold. The crystal structure of TiO2 markedly affected the rate of H2 production and pollutant removal. The mixed anatase–rutile phase crystal structure TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than that in the single rutile crystal structure, probably due to the co-presence of rutile and anatase phases of TiO2. The properties of the mixed crystal structure TiO2 photocatalyst, including the crystallite size, BET surface area, pore volume, band gap energy and point of zero charge (PZC) value affected the photocatalytic activity more than the phase composition. Among the evaluated mixed crystal structure, the TiO2 photocatalyst treated at 400 °C (T400) showed a great potential to produce H2 simultaneously with pollutant removal of approximately 19.83%, 83.13% and 84.13% of COD, BOD and oil & grease, respectively, with a H2 production rate of 67.4 µmol/h. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers"

2-s2.0-85022025724,"Antioxidant-conjugated star-shaped PLLA (star-PLLA-PPD) were originally proposed as a novel polyfunctional free radical stabilizing additive for bioplastics. By a simple ring opening polymerization of L-lactide (L-LA) on a poly-functional core molecule (i.e., pentaerylthritol) using tin (II)-2-ethylhexanoate (SnOct2) as a catalyst, the 4-arms star-shaped PLLA was successfully prepared and confirmed by FT-IR and 1H-NMR. Percent conversion of L-LA to 4-arms star-PLLA was 78.50% and the weight and number average molecular weights determined by GPC were 34726 Da and 27286 Da, respectively (PDI = 1.27). Piperidine (PPD) was then conjugated onto 4-arms star-PLLA to obtain star-PLLA-PPD. As observed by SEM and DSC, the star-PLLA-PPD exhibited excellent compatibilizer as well as nucleating agent for PLA. A model study on free radical scavenging ability of the star-PLLA-PPD in PLA blends was carried out under radiation-induced free radical process. Irradiation doses of 10 kGy and 25 kGy were used because they are generally used for food and medical device sterilization, respectively. Free radical scavenging ability was demonstrated using EPR spectroscopy. The star-PLLA-PPD efficiently scavenges the free radicals in PLA matrix upon irradiation. The star-PLLA-PPD additive could retard the degradation of PLA under irradiation as observed by protecting molecular weight reduction when compared with the neat PLA. The migration of star-PLLA-PPD is significant lower than PPD. A novel star-PLLA-PPD additive would be a good model of polyfunctional bio-based antioxidant additive for bioplastics especially for food packaging and biomedical materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019957526,"Objective Purinergic 2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activation modulates in vitro mineralization by primary rat and human osteoblasts. However, the detailed mechanism of how P2X7R activation affects primary human osteoblasts remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of P2X7R activation on human mandibular-derived osteoblast (hMOB) differentiation. Design Primary human osteoblasts were obtained from non-pathologic mandibular bone from healthy patients. The hMOBs were cultured in osteogenic medium with or without 0.5–5 μM 2′(3′)-O-(4-benzoyl) benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a selective P2X7R agonist. The mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation markers and WNT-signaling molecules was investigated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In vitro mineral deposition was determined by Alizarin Red S staining. Transfection of small interfering RNA was performed to confirm the effect of P2X7R activation. WNT/β-catenin signaling was detected by immunofluorescence staining for β-catenin. Results BzATP inhibited osteogenic medium-induced RUNX2 and OSX mRNA expression in hMOBs. Moreover, BzATP significantly retarded in vitro mineralization. These findings indicated that BzATP/P2X7R activation inhibited hMOB differentiation. Interestingly, reduced WNT3A mRNA expression and blockage of osteogenic medium-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation were also found. These data suggested that WNT signaling might be a target of P2X7R-regulated osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, when recombinant human WNT3A was added to the BzATP-treated group, it rescued the reduced RUNX2 and OSX expression, and in vitro mineralization. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that P2X7R activation by BzATP inhibits hMOB differentiation. This inhibitory effect was associated with inhibition of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85020479458,"Objective To assess mortality and loss to follow-up of children with HIV infection who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the Universal Coverage Health Program (UC) in Thailand. Study design Children with HIV infection who initiated ART at age <15 years through the UC between 2008 and 2013 were included in the analysis. Death was ascertained through linkage with the National Death Registry. A competing-risks method was used to calculate subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) of predictors for loss to follow-up. Death was considered a competing risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess predictors of mortality. Results A total of 4618 children from 497 hospitals in Thailand were included in the study. Median age at ART initiation was 9 years (IQR, 6-12 years), and the median duration of tracking was 4.1 years (a total of 18 817 person-years). Three hundred and ninety-five children (9%) died, for a mortality rate of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9-2.3) per 100 person-years, and 525 children (11%) were lost to follow-up, for a lost to follow-up rate of 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7-3.2) per 100 person-years. The cumulative incidence of loss to follow-up increased from 4% at 1 year to 8.8% at 3 years. Children who started ART at age ≥12 years were at the greatest risk of loss to follow-up. The probability of death was 3.2% at 6 months and 6.4% at 3 years. Age ≥12 years at ART initiation, lower baseline CD4%, advanced HIV staging, and loss to follow-up were associated with mortality. Conclusion The Thai national HIV treatment program has been very effective in treating children with HIV infection, with low mortality and modest rates of loss to follow-up. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85019605476,"To compare the effectiveness of myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion versus observation in post-radiation otitis media with effusion (OME) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). NPC patients who finished radiotherapy and had persistent OME were randomized to myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion and observation groups. The resolution rate of OME and hearing outcomes were evaluated. Forty three patients (23 in control group and 20 in intervention group) were analyzed. One patient in the control group obtained a resolution of OME. The remaining patients in the control group had persistent middle ear fluid. Fourteen patients in the intervention group had retained ventilation tubes without otorrhea. Ventilation tubes had spontaneously extruded in the remaining six patients and all of these patients had recurrent OME. Mean air-pure tone average in the control group was 52.04 dB (SD 11.61), significantly different from the intervention group [38.15 dB (SD 19.10); p = 0.01]. Mean air-bone gap in the control and intervention groups were 27.30 dB (SD 9.11) and 9.30 dB (SD 9.59) respectively (p < 0.001). Mean air-pure tone average and mean air-bone gap improvement was significantly improved in the intervention group (p < 0.001). Two patients in the intervention group (10%) developed complications, one patient suffering suppurative otitis media whilst another had otorrhea, which resolved after 1-week course of antibiotic treatment. Post-radiation OME is common in patients with NPC and tends to persist long-term. Conservative management is safe, however, is plagued by frustrating effects of hearing impairment and aural fullness.

2-s2.0-85020725619,"Many insects, including stag beetles, possess exaggerated structures and these structures usually grow disproportionately with their body size. Allometry, i.e. the scaling relationship between such traits and other body parts (used as proxies of body size in a species), can provide valuable information about development and evolution. We examined males of Aegus chelifer chelifer, a stag beetle from forest and urban habitats in Thailand to clarify the allometric relationship between weapon (mandible) and body (elytra) size. The relationship between the log-transformed mandible and elytra length was non-linear and best fitted the piecewise linear model. Moreover, this model revealed the existence of dimorphism in males that could be divided into minor and major morphs based on their mandible size, in broad agreement with the morph classification based on mandible shape. Both morphs from the two populations (urban and forest) exhibited positive allometry, and the allometric slope declined in the major morph. Comparison between populations showed the allometric slopes were similar, but the intercepts were significantly different in the major morphs. The genetic or environmental basis should be further explored for the two morphs as well as any behavioural variation. © 2017"

This study aimed to investigate the effects of mirtazapine (MIRT) alone and combined with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) against corticosterone (CORT) induced behavioral and oxidative alterations. Methods Male mice received vehicle or CORT 20 mg/kg during 14 days. From the 15th to 21st days they were divided in groups administered: vehicle, MIRT 3 mg/kg or the combinations MIRT+ALA100 or MIRT+ALA200. On the 21st day of treatment, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests. Twenty-four hours after the last drug administration hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST) were dissected for the determination reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP) and nitrite levels. Results CORT induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as observed by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased sucrose consumption. MIRT or MIRT+ALA are effective in reversing anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by CORT. CORT and MIRT alone prolonged sleeping time and this effect was reversed by MIRT+ALA. CORT significantly increased LP, which was reversed by MIRT or MIRT+ALA. Nitrite levels were increased in CORT-treated animals and reversed by MIRT+ALA200 (HC), MIRT or MIRT+ALA (ST). Limitation A relative small sample size and lack of a washout period between drug administration and behavioral testing. Conclusions MIRT or MIRT+ALA reverse CORT-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors probably via their central antioxidant effects.

2-s2.0-85019424490,"Common methods of managing dairy manure are directly applying it to the farm field as a fertilizer. For direct application without any type of treatment, the majority of nutrients in the manure run off to the local river and lake during precipitation periods. The algae bloom is one of the environmental outcomes due to eutrophication of the lakes, which may jeopardize the quality of drinking water. In this study, superheated steam drying (SSD) technology is investigated as an alternative manure management method. Rapidly dried cow manure can be used as alternative fuel. Evaluations of energy payback time (EPBT) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the SSD technology are presented in the SSD scenario and the results are compared with those of the direct field application (FA) of fresh manure and anaerobic digestion (AD). The heat required for the generation of superheated steam in the SSD scenario is provided from combustion of the dry manure to reduce energy costs. The results for the SSD process show 95% and 70% lower eutrophication and global warming potential in comparison to the FA scenario. Acidification potential for SSD turned out to be 35% higher than FA. The comparison of SSD with AD for their EPBT and normalized impacts indicated that the proposed SSD scenario has higher environmental sustainability than AD (70% lower impact), and is likely an economically better choice compared to conventional AD method (87% lower EPBT) for the future investment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85016392676,"Viral diseases are a significant problem in the shrimp aquaculture industry as outbreaks can cause significant mortality and economic loss. While it has been shown that triggering the shrimp RNA interference pathway through dsRNA is a potentially viable treatment pathway, this approach is hampered by the lack of a suitable delivery mechanism. Virus-like particles (VLPs), which are structurally similar to native viruses but lack the genetic material, could possibly be developed as a delivery vehicle. To generate a candidate VLP, the Penaeus monodon densovirus (PmDNV) capsid protein was cloned with an added histidine tag and expressed in an E. coli expression system. While the protein was expressed in inclusion bodies, the recombinant PmDNV capsid protein could be dissolved and subsequently purified by nickel affinity column chromatography. The formation of VLP from this purified rPmDNV capsid protein was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and PmDNV-VLPs were observed that looked similar to the native PmDNV virion. Our results suggest that the PmDNV-like particle could be promisingly applied towards vaccination and that this PmDNV-like particle can potentially serve as a system for delivery of nucleic acids to trigger innate immunity in shrimp. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
2-s2.0-85016132113,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential in tissue physiology and pathologic conditions such as tumorigenesis. It affects tumor cell behavior, proliferation, and metastasis. Pituitary adenomas differ in their clinical characteristics, including ECM deposition, and we recently reported that the characteristics of collagen-producing cells differed between control human anterior pituitary gland and pituitary adenomas. ECM deposition is not defined solely by production; degradation and maintenance are also important. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) help maintain ECM by inhibiting degradation caused by matrix metalloproteases. The present study attempted to characterize TIMP-expressing cells in the human anterior pituitary. Specimens of human pituitary adenomas and control pituitary were obtained during surgery, and in situ hybridization for TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, and TIMP4, followed by immunohistochemistry, was used to characterize TIMP-expressing cells. TIMP expression exhibited a distinct pattern in the human anterior pituitary. Azan staining showed that fibrous matrix deposition varied among pituitary adenomas and that the area of fibrosis was associated with the number and number of types of TIMP3-expressing cells. These results suggest that TIMPs are important in the maintenance of ECM in human pituitary and that TIMP expressions are altered in fibrosis associated with pituitary adenoma. © 2017, The Japanese Society for Clinical Molecular Morphology."
2-s2.0-85018764260,"The objective of this study was to determine the immunoexpression of oestrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in the gilt ovary and its association with cause of culling, ovarian appearance and the existence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus in the ovary. In total, 62 ovaries were collected from culled replacement gilts. The gilts were classified according to the cause of culling (abnormal vaginal discharge, abortion, anoestrus, repeated service and non-reproductive causes), ovarian appearance (non-cycling and cycling) and the existence of PRRS virus in the ovary (not exist and exist). Ovarian ERβ expression was determined using immunohistochemistry. The proportion of ERβ immunostaining in the theca cells surrounding the follicles was evaluated using imaging software. The result revealed that ERβ immunostaining expressed in the theca interna cells of the follicles in the gilt ovary. The ERβ immunostaining was detected in 23.7 ± 19.8% (range 0–98.4%) of the theca cells. The gilts culled due to anoestrus had lower ERβ immunostaining (19.3%) compared to those culled due to non-reproductive causes (28.9%, P = 0.010) and repeated service (31.3%, P = 0.008). However, the expression of ERβ in the ovarian tissues with and without PRRS virus existence was not different (26.8 and 25.2%, respectively, P = 0.538). Likewise, ERβ immunoexpression in the follicles of non-cycling and cycling ovaries was not different (25.8 versus 26.3%, P = 0.851). In conclusion, the gilts culled due to anoestrus had relatively poor ovarian ERβ immunoexpression. Neither the existence of PRRS virus nor ovarian appearance was associated with ERβ immunoexpression in the gilt ovary. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London."
2-s2.0-85014672501,"Rationale and Objectives Abdominal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has gained favor in pediatric patients owing to its lack of ionizing radiation and noninvasive nature. Reports exist regarding incidental findings on body MRA in adult patients. However, the incidental findings in pediatric abdominal MRA have not been previously reported. Our study aims to determine the frequencies, characteristics, and categories of incidental findings in pediatric patients undergoing abdominal MRA. Materials and Methods Retrospective study was performed in 78 consecutive contrast-enhanced abdominal MRA of patients between ages 0 and 20 years over a 7-year time period. The presence of incidental vascular and extravascular findings was noted. Reports were categorized in consensus by two radiologists as no incidental finding (group A), normal or normal variants or nonsignificant incidental common findings (group B), or abnormal incidental findings (group C). Group C was reviewed to determine whether additional management was performed. Results A total of 40 boys and 38 girls (51%:49%) were reported, with a mean age of 12.3 years (standard deviation ±5.6 years, range 7 days to 20 years). Three most common indications for MRA were renal artery stenosis (24.4%), vasculitis (21.8%), and suspected intra-abdominal venous thrombosis (14.1%). We identified a total of 92 incidental findings in 50 of 78 patients; 60 findings in 29 patients in group B, and 32 findings in 21 patients in group C. Atelectasis at the lung bases was the most common incidental finding in group B (14 of 78 patients). The most common findings in group C were ascites, scoliosis, and splenomegaly. There were three abnormal incidental findings that led to causative workup and/or further management (moderate ascites, pericardial and pleural effusion, and venous malformation). The remaining cases with abnormal findings received treatment of their primary conditions only. Conclusions Pediatric abdominal MRA revealed a large number of incidental findings. The large majority were findings without clinical significance. Basal lung atelectasis was the most common overall incidental and nonsignificant finding, whereas ascites was the most common abnormal incidental finding. Although not all abnormal incidental findings affected management, appropriate identification and communication of relevant findings would improve patient care. © 2017 The Association of University Radiologists"
2-s2.0-84994474511,"Aim: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease leading to joint damage, functional disability, poor quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are a principal strategy to improve outcomes. To provide best practices in the diagnosis and management of patients with RA, the Thai Rheumatism Association (TRA) developed scientifically sound and clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for general practitioners, internists, orthopedists, and physiatrists. Methods: Thirty-seven rheumatologists from across Thailand formulated 18 clinically relevant questions: three for diagnosis, 10 for treatments, four for monitoring, and one for referral. A bibliographic team systematically reviewed the relevant literature on these topics up to December 2013. A set of recommendations was proposed based on the results of systematic reviews combined with expert opinions. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique. Results: A set of recommendations was proposed. For diagnosis, either American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria can be applied. For treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoid, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including antimalarials, methotrexate and sulfasalazine are recommended. Physiotherapy should be suggested to all patients. Tight control strategy and monitoring for efficacy and side effects of treatments, as well as indications for referral to a rheumatologist are provided. Conclusions: These evidence-based recommendations provide practical guidance for diagnosis, fundamental management and referral of patients with RA for non-rheumatologists. However, it should be incorporated with clinical judgments and decisions about care for each individual patient. © 2016 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"
2-s2.0-84994875653,"This study identified the incidence of parametrial involvement in low risk, early-stage cervical cancer patients and evaluated the factors associated with parametrial involvement. All stage IA2–IB1 cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma grade 1–2, tumour size less than 2 cm, no lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), negative pelvic nodes and depth of stromal invasion (DSI) less than 10 mm were identified as the low-risk group. A total of 243 patients were eligible. Squamous cell carcinomas were the most frequent histological cell type (65%). Most patients (81.5%) had tumour size less than 2 cm. Thirteen patients (5.3%) had parametrial involvement, 77 (31.7%) had DSI more than 10 mm, 121 (49.8%) had more than 50% invasion, 119 (49%) had LVSI and 19 (7.5%) had node metastasis. Ninety-five patients (39.1%) were defined as low risk. None of low-risk group had parametrial involvement. DSI more than 10 mm or more than 50% stromal invasion, presence of LVSI and pelvic node metastasis were significant factors associated with parametrial involvement. Parametrial involvement in low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer is extremely low. Less radical surgery may be an alternative treatment option. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
2-s2.0-84989221967,"Blend membranes between sulfonated poly(ether ketone ether sulfone) (S-PEKES) and poly(phenylene ether ether sulfone) (PPEES) were fabricated at various mole ratios. Interestingly, increasing the hydrophobic PPEES in S-PEKES/PPEES blend membranes led to the decreases in water uptake (%) when compared to S-PEKES. Incorporation of molecular sieve 13X drastically improved proton conductivity. Methanol permeability slightly decreased with molecular sieve 13X. The composite membrane with the 15% v/v molecular sieve 13X content showed the highest proton conductivity of 1.44 × 10−2 S/cm which is four times higher than Nafion 117. Thus, the blending between S-PEKES and PPEES can help to decrease methanol permeability, and incorporating molecular sieve 13X can enhance proton conductivity. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-84995563302,"Aim: To investigate the response of immature permanent teeth with nonvital pulps after revitalization procedures using cone beam computed tomography imaging and conventional radiograph. Methodology: Clinical records of patients who had undergone revitalization between 1997 and 2014 were collected. Seventeen patients attended the follow-up examination. Clinical examination and radiographic examination by means of CBCT imaging and conventional radiographs were conducted to evaluate treatment outcomes, especially the dimensional changes of the root and the pattern of root maturation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Fisher's exact test and Monte Carlo test to investigate the effect of potential outcome predictors. Results: For the follow-up period as far as 96 months, thirteen teeth (76%) were classified as a ‘success’. Conventional radiographs showed various degrees of dimensional changes in the immature roots ranging from 0% to 73% changes. The mean percentage changes of root length and root wall thickness were 14.38 ± 20.92% and 13.82 ± 11.17%, respectively. CBCT images illustrated various patterns of root maturation including incomplete root development with wide-open apices and fully formed roots with various apical shapes. Root canal contents varied radiographically from empty canals to many degrees of unpredictable patterning of radiopaque deposits. Conclusion: Revitalization in immature teeth with nonvital pulps resulted in unpredictable responses in terms of continued root development. Various types of root maturation and root canal contents were observed radiographically, which were different from typical root development. © 2016 International Endodontic Journal.

Materials and methods: Twenty patients who were treated with an anterior maxillary single implant restoration were recalled for esthetic outcome evaluation using pink and white esthetic scores (PES/WES). All patients completed a questionnaire regarding satisfaction of treatment outcome and quality of life related to the implant restorations. Patient satisfaction was assessed by visual analog scales (VAS) analysis, whereas oral impact on daily life performances (OIDP) was used to evaluate the quality of life of patients. Results: The esthetic outcome assessed by PES/WES showed favorable results. The median PES/WES scores were 16.00 (maximum possible score = 20). The median PES scores and WES scores were 7.50 and 8.00, respectively. Patient satisfaction rated in VAS scale ranged from 8 to 10. OIDP assessment showed an impact on daily life performance in 45% of patients. The most common impacts were eating (n = 5) and cleaning teeth (n = 4). No significant difference in PES/WES scores was found between the patients who perceived and did not perceive oral impacts. Conclusions: There was some discrepancy between the dentist's evaluation and patient's perception but a strong positive satisfaction was reported from all patients which let suppose that the psychosocial factors that involve patient's perspective should be further investigated. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-84973161403,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine a plain radiographic criterion for determining the feasibility of using the standard anterior Smith-Robinson supramanubrial approach for anterior surgery down to T2 or T3. Methods: The surgical database (2002–2014) was searched to identify patients with anterior cervical surgery to T2 or T3. A method to determine whether a standard anterior Smith-Robinson approach can be used to operate on the upper thoracic levels was evaluated. The surgeon chose the surgical approach preoperatively using a lateral radiograph by determining if a line from the intended skin incision to the lower instrumented level (LIV) passed above the top of the manubrium. If so, a standard Smith-Robinson approach was selected. Another spine surgeon then analyzed all patients who had anterior thoracic fusion to T2 or below. The lateral radiographs were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 44 patients who underwent anterior surgery down to T2 or T3 vertebrae were identified. T2 was the LIV in 39 patients. T3 was the LIV in five patients. No surgery was abandoned or converted to a difference approach after making the standard Smith-Robinson approach. To increase visualization, T1 corpectomy was necessary in 4 of 39 patients when T2 was the LIV. T2 corpectomy was necessary in 2 of 5 patients when T3 was the LIV. Conclusion: If a line from the intended skin incision to the LIV passes over the top of the manubrium, a standard Smith-Robinson approach without sternotomy can be successfully used. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-84954510840,"Most patient education involves passive learning. To improve patient education regarding surgery, an active learning workshop-based teaching method is proposed. The objective of this study was to assess level of patient surgical knowledge, achievement of workshop learning objectives, patient apprehension about future surgery, and participant workshop satisfaction after completing a surgical training workshop. A four-station workshop (surgical scrub, surgical suture, laparoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery) was developed to teach four important components of the surgical process. Healthy, surgery-naive adolescents were enrolled to attend this 1-h workshop-based training program. Training received by participants was technically and procedurally identical to training received by actual surgeons. Pre- and post-workshop questionnaires were used to assess learning outcomes. There were 1312 participants, with a mean age 15.9 ± 1.1 years and a gender breakdown of 303 males and 1009 females. For surgical knowledge, mean pre-workshop and post-workshop scores were 6.1 ± 1.5 and 7.5 ± 1.5 (out of 10 points), respectively (p < 0.001). Out of 5 possible points, achievement of learning objectives, decreased apprehension about future surgery, and overall workshop satisfaction scores were all higher than 4.5. Active, hands-on patient education is an effective way to improve understanding of surgery-related processes.

2-s2.0-85028546622,"Background: Cellular senescence due to genomic instability is believed to be one of the mechanisms causing health problems in diabetes mellitus (DM). Low methylation levels of Alu elements or Alu hypomethylation, an epigenomic event causing genomic instability, were commonly found in aging people and patients with aging phenotypes, such as osteoporosis. Results: We investigate Alu methylation levels of white blood cells of type 2 DM, pre-DM, and control. The DM group possess the lowest Alu methylation (P < 0.001, P < 0.0001 adjusted age). In the DM group, Alu hypomethylation is directly correlated with high fasting blood sugar, HbA1C, and blood pressure. Conclusion: Genome-wide hypomethylation may be one of the underlining mechanisms causing genomic instability in type 2 DM. Moreover, Alu methylation levels may be a useful biomarker for monitoring cellular senescence in type 2 DM patients. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85019993847,"The characteristics of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) including type of materials (carbon cloth and carbon paper), thickness, PTFE content and the presence of a micro porous layer of the GDL are found to influence the morphology and electrochemical active surface area of the Pt electrodeposited layer and fuel cell performance. The Pt particles deposited on carbon cloth are smaller than those deposited on carbon paper, but agglomerate in some areas. Despite their morphological differences, the Pt catalysts deposited on carbon cloth and carbon paper have relatively similar active surface area performance at 0.6 V. The Pt deposited on the very thin GDL, or on the GDL having high %PTFE or containing the micro porous layer consist of non-uniform particles distributed unevenly on the GDL surfaces, resulting in low active surface areas and performances. The Pt electrodeposition on the GDL containing the micro porous layer, however, can be improved by eliminating the hydrophobic sublayer in the post-treatment of GDL leading to the formation of smaller and more uniform particles with uniform distribution, resulting in increased active surface area and enhanced performance to the levels comparable to those obtained from non-micro porous layer GDL with suitable thickness and %PTFE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Patients should also feel more comfortable with digital impressions, but only a few studies evaluating this subject have been performed. Purpose The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the marginal fit of monolithic zirconia crowns and patients’ preferences for digital impressions versus polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions. Material and methods Sixteen participants with indications for single molar crowns were included. After crown preparation, digital impressions by intraoral scanner and PVS impressions were made. The participants were asked to complete a 6-item questionnaire with a visual analog scale related to perceptions of each of the following topics: time involved, taste/smell, occlusal registration, size of impression tray/scanner, gag reflex, and overall preference. Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing monolithic zirconia crowns were fabricated from both impressions. The crowns were evaluated intraorally, and a blinded examiner measured the marginal discrepancy of silicone replicas under a stereomicroscope. Intraexaminer reliability was evaluated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Data for patients’ preferences and marginal discrepancies were analyzed using the paired t test (α=.05). Results Visual analog scale scores for digital impressions were statistically significantly higher than those for PVS impressions in every topic (P<.05), except for occlusal registration. The results showed excellent reliability of the examiner with an intraclass correlation coefficient of .996. No significant difference was found in marginal discrepancies between the PVS group and the digital group on all sides (P>.05).

2-s2.0-85019743395,"The formation of epithelial microfold (M) cells is mediated through cell-to-cell interactions between enterocytes and lymphocytes. Based on this concept, we developed a cell-to-cell model by encouraging interactions between enterocyte C2BBe1 and Raji B cells through a preincubation approach. Raji B cells and C2BBe1 cells were allowed to interact in detached condition for 2 h at ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 and then plated in culture plates. Monocultured C2BBe1 cells were used as the control. Flow cytometric analysis of the M cell-specific marker clusterin revealed that the optimum ratio of Raji B to C2BBe1 cells to obtain the maximum number of M cells was 1:1. Scanning electron micrographs exhibiting the lack of microvilli with complete tight junctions and Western blot analysis showing intense expression of clusterin confirmed the unique phenotypes of the formed M cells. Fluosphere® transport studies showed a 7-fold increase in the cell-to-cell model compared to the monoculture control. Importantly, we found that the induction of M cells could be enhanced by the effect of epithelial growth factor (EGF). C2BBe1 cells were pretreated with EGF at 10, 25 and 50 ng/mL before co-culturing with Raji B cells. Flow cytometric analysis of clusterin revealed that EGF significantly increased the formation of M cells. From mechanistic studies, we found an increase in the number of M cells involved the induction of stemness by EGF indicated by a dramatic increase in β-catenin, Nanog, and Oct-4, which in turn up-regulated the cell-to-cell interacting protein Integrin β-1. Furthermore, we confirmed the transport functions of the conventional, cell-to-cell, and cell-to-cell with EGF models using a Fluosphere® transport assay. Overall, we demonstrated an effective novel protocol for the formation of M cells as well as the effect of EGF on enhancing cell-to-cell interaction, which may benefit transport studies in M cells and promote better understanding of the biology of M cells. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85028826157,"Background: Several endocrine disruptors (including phthalates) are considered to be a cause of obesity. However, the current evidence has not conclusively established an association between phthalates and metabolic abnormalities, especially in children. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and metabolic abnormalities in obese Thai children and adolescents. Methods: This cross-sectional case-control study was conducted in participants aged 7-18 years and divided into two groups: normal weight and overweight/obesity. Spot urine concentrations of two phthalate metabolites (monomethyl phthalate [MMP] and mono-n-buthyl phthalate [MBP]) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Anthropometric data, including weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHTR), were measured and calculated. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipid profiles and hepatic transaminase were analyzed, and insulin resistance indices were calculated. Results: One hundred and fifty-five participants were included. The median MMP level in the normal weight and the overweight/obesity groups were 0 (0, 459.83) and 0 (0, 1623.50) μg/g Cr, respectively (p = 0.933). The median MBP level in the normal weight and the overweight/obesity groups were 233.6 (118.1, 633.62) and 206.94 (7.4, 427.7) μg/g Cr, respectively (p = 0.083). After adjusting for age, gender and puberty, there was no correlation between MBP and all anthropometric data and metabolic profiles. Participants with hypertriglyceridemia had lower MBP levels than those with normal TG level. MMP levels were not significantly different between the participants with normal and abnormal weight of all metabolic parameters. Conclusions: Participants with hypertriglyceridemia had lower MBP levels than those with normotriglyceridemia. However, it cannot show the correlation between phthalate and metabolic parameters."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a PDHB program among middle-aged and elderly patients with DM type 2 in primary care units in Thailand. Patients and methods: A quasi-experimental study design was applied. DM type 2 patients were recruited in the PDHB program by a simple random sampling method. The 3-month program consisted of a weekly health education structured for ~20 minutes, a 15-minute group activity training, a 10-minute individual record of participants’ knowledge and practice regarding diet control, exercise, oral hypoglycemic drug taking, diet, self-care, alcohol consumption, smoking, weight management, and HbA1c, and a 15- to 30-minute home visit as well as the PDHB for recording self-care behavior daily. The control group received only the usual diabetes care. The primary expected outcomes were changes in HbA1c from the baseline data to 3 months after the program compared between the intervention and control groups. The secondary expected outcomes were compared within the intervention group. The third expected outcomes were changes in the mean score of knowledge and practice from baseline to 3 months after the program within and between the intervention and control groups. Results: Compared with the baseline data, there was no significant difference in HbA1c, knowledge, and practice mean score between the intervention and control groups. However, there was a significant difference in HbA1c, knowledge, and practice mean score in the intervention group after they received a 3-month PDHB program and within the intervention group (p-value =0.00). Conclusion: The PDHB program was effective in lowering HbA1c while also improving the mean score of knowledge and practice among elderly patients with DM type 2.

2-s2.0-85018190495,"A decision to accept death and forego life-extending medical procedures can be both rational and irrational. This article reviews perspectives on death from the viewpoint of behavioral economics, which relies on psychology as the basis of decision-making in this regard. According to behavioral economics, both the benefits of living and the costs of death should be emphasized so that a person who is thinking about suicide reconsiders that option and, hopefully, changes his or her mind and tries to safeguard life and avoid life-threatening risks. One way to make dying decisions more rational is to write out a living will or advance directives to help doctors understand a patients’ intentions with regard to decisions about dying should they become unable to articulate that intention at some later, critical, life-or-death situation. Living wills and advance directives can therefore reduce the chances of mercy killing or euthanasia, especially in the context of a developing country, especially when life-extending technologies are limited. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The supports and supported Pd catalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, CO pulse chemisorption, and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. The highest hydrogenation activity was found for the largest pore catalyst, Pd/MCM-41-a3, as presented in term of the turnover frequency (TOF), whereas Pd/MCM41-a8 and Pd/MCM-41-a5 provided higher selectivity toward cis-monounsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), which was attributed to their limited pore dimension.

2-s2.0-85027678772,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major health risk in Thailand. Although it is reported that females have a higher rate of MetS than males, very few peer-led intervention studies have been conducted on specific groups, such as seamstresses, at risk of MetS. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peer-led intervention program on reducing MetS risk factors in individuals working in Thai Uniform Sewing Military Factories. Methods: A quasiexperimental program was introduced using a pre-and posttest design that was applied to female sewing factory workers selected for this research. All participants had at least one of the key MetS symptoms. The experimental group (N=50 participants) received 12 weekly peer-led individual support discussion sessions that included both dietary and physical activity (PA) advice and the control group (N=50 participants) followed their usual daily routines. The Student’s t-test and the Pearson’s chi-squared test were used to compare the differences of baseline data and analysis of variance was used for analysis of the data after intervention. Results: The results showed that after 3 months of participation, when compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly improved systolic blood pressure (BP) (P=0.04), diastolic BP (P=0.001), PA (P=0.05), knowledge scores of MetS, perception of MetS and risk factors (P=0.001), and stress assessment (P=0.002).

Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that a peer-led support program can be introduced as an effective means of improving the behaviors of mostly sedentary factory workers at risk of MetS caused by working habits that are detrimental to health. © 2017 Sanee et al."
2-s2.0-85012991885,"BACKGROUND: The use of biodegradable polymeric materials has been proposed as an environmentally-friendly alternative to petroleum-based packaging. To extend the shelf life of food products, these bioplastics must possess appropriate barrier properties and food-package stability. In the present study, shelf life analysis of packaged baby formula in biopolymeric, multilayer film, fabricated from poly(lactide) (PLA) and whey protein isolate (WPI), PLA/WPI/PLA and PLA pouches was performed at 4–35 oC and 50–59% relative humidity. RESULTS: Despite the possible sorption of food components into contact PLA surfaces, the results demonstated that the transparency and barrier properties of PLA-based pouches were insignificantly changed over time (P > 0.05), although the films showed a slow rate of color change. The baby formula packaged in PLA/WPI/PLA had a delayed lipid oxidation compared to the sample in the PLA pouch, especially at a higher temperature. The application of WPI in the multilayer structure shifted the shelf life determination factor from lipid oxidation to moisture gain. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the PLA/WPI/PLA pouch has good storage stability. The film could be used to package dry food properly at 4–35 oC and 50–59% relative humidity for an extended period of time. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry"

The back-to-back azimuthal alignment was studied in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions for Z bosons with transverse momentum pTZ>60 GeV/c and a recoiling jet with pTjet>30 GeV/c. The pT imbalance xjZ=pTjet/pTZ, as well as the average number of jet partners per Z, RjZ, was studied in intervals of pTZ. The RjZ is found to be smaller in Pb-Pb than in pp collisions, which suggests that in Pb-Pb collisions a larger fraction of partons associated with the Z bosons fall below the 30 GeV/c pTjet threshold because they lose energy. © 2017 CERN. © 2017 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

2-s2.0-85029094884,"The recent birth of gravitational wave astronomy invites a new generation of precision tests of general relativity. Signatures of black hole (BH) mergers must be systematically explored in a wide spectrum of modified gravity theories. Here, we turn to one such theory in which the initial value problem for BH mergers is well posed, the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system. We present conservative estimates for the merger parameters (final spins, quasinormal modes) based on techniques that have worked well for ordinary gravity mergers and utilize information extracted from test particle motion in the final BH metric. The computation is developed in parallel for the modified gravity BHs (we specifically focus on the Kaluza-Klein value of the dilaton coupling, for which analytic BH solutions are known) and ordinary Kerr-Newman BHs. We comment on the possibility of obtaining final BHs with spins consistent with current observations. © 2017 American Physical Society."
2-s2.0-85033226225,"A search for single production of vector-like top quark partners (T) decaying into a Higgs boson and a top quark is performed using data from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1. The top quark decay includes an electron or a muon while the Higgs boson decays into a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds is observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction are derived in the T quark mass range 700 to 1800 GeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, values of the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction greater than 0.8 and 0.7 pb are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming left- and right-handed coupling of the T quark to standard model particles, respectively. This is the first analysis setting exclusion limits on the cross section of singly produced vector-like T quarks at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. © 2017 The Author(s)"
2-s2.0-85027358250,"Research in the miniaturization of planar chromatography led to various approaches in manufacturing ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) layers of reduced thickness (<50 µm) along with smaller instrumentation, as targeted in Office Chromatography. This novel concept merges 3D print & media technologies with miniaturized planar chromatography to realize an all-in-one instrument, in which all steps of UTLC are automated and integrated in the same tiny device. In this context, the development of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber phases was investigated as well as its performance. A nanofibrous stationary phase with fiber diameters of 150–225 nm and a thickness of ca. 25 µm was manufactured. Mixtures of water-soluble food dyes were printed on it using a modified office printer, and successfully separated to illustrate the capabilities of such UTLC media. The separation took 8 min for 30 mm and was faster (up to a factor of 2) than on particulate layers. The mean hRF values ranging from 25 to 90 for the five food dyes were well spread over the migration distance, with an overall reproducibility of 7% (mean %RSD over 5 different plates for 5 dyes). The individual mean plate numbers over 5 plates ranged between 8286 and 22,885 (mean of 11,722 over all 5 dyes). The single mean resolutions RS were between 1.7 and 6.5 (for the 5 food dyes over 5 plates), with highly satisfying reproducibilities (0.3 as mean deviation of RS). Using videodensitometry, different amounts separated in parallel led to reliable linear calibrations for each dye (sdv of 3.1–9.1% for peak heights and 2.4–9.3% for peak areas). Coupling to mass spectrometry via an elution head-based interface was successfully demonstrated for such ultrathin layers, showing several advantages such as a reduced cleaning process and a minimum zone distance. All these results underline the potential of electrospun nanofibrous phases to succeed as affordable stationary phase for quantitative UTLC. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-84983507429,"In this study, new undrained stability solutions of cantilever flood walls in clay were proposed and solved by finite element analysis with a two-dimensional plane strain condition. The analysis considered flood walls in homogeneous and non-homogeneous clay layers, where the latter corresponded to a linear increase in shear strength with depth. Two parametric studies were performed for embedded length ratios and dimensionless strength gradients. Results were summarised in the form of design charts for stability number, normalised maximum shear force and normalised maximum bending moment as a function of those two parameters. Closed-form solutions were proposed for a convenient and accurate evaluation of undrained stability of flood walls in practice, and their applications were demonstrated through a back analysis of a case study. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85026916059,"Background: This study compares a combination of processes of care and clinical targets among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between specialist diabetes clinics (SDCs) and general medical clinics (GMCs), and how differences between these two types of clinics differ with hospital type (community, provincial and regional). Methods: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patient medical records were collected from 595 hospitals (499 community, 70 provincial, 26 regional) in Thailand between April 1 to June 30, 2012 resulting in a cross-sectional sample of 26,860 patients. Generalized linear mixed modeling was conducted to examine associations between clinic type and quality of care. The outcome variables of interest were split into clinical targets and process of care. A subsequent subgroup analysis was conducted to examine if the nature of clinical target and process of care differences between GMCs and SDCs varied with hospital type (regional, provincial, community). Results: Regardless of the types of hospitals (regional, provincial, or community) patients attending SDCs were considerably more likely to have eye and foot exam. In terms of larger hospitals (regional and provincial) patients attending SDCs were more likely to achieve HbA1c exam, All FACE exam, BP target, and the Num7Q. Interestingly, SDCs performed better than GMCs at only provincial hospitals for LDL-C target and the All7Q. Finally, patients with T2DM who attended community hospital-GMCs had a better chance of achieving the blood pressure target than patients who attended community hospital-SDCs. Conclusions: Specialized diabetes clinics outperform general medical clinics for both regional and provincial hospitals for all quality of care indicators and the number of quality of care indicators achieved was never lower. However, this better performance of SDC was not observed in community hospital. Indeed, GMCs outperformed SDCs for some quality of care indicators in the community level setting. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85018441483,"We demonstrate an advance in the fabrication of circular dichroism (CD) sensors for detection of Cd2 + and S2 − based on chiral CdS quantum dots (QDs) generated by a facile in-situ reaction. The chiral quantum dots are generated in solutions composed of Cd2 +, S2 −, cysteamine (CA) and L-penicillamine (L-PA), with the number of the generated particles limited by either the Cd2 + or S2 − concentration. We show that the magnitude of the CD signal produced by the QDs is linearly related to the initial concentration of Cd2 + and S2 −, with excellent selectivity over other ions. Our sensor functions over concentration ranges of 65–200 μM and 7–125 μM with detection limits of 59.7 and 1.6 μM for Cd2 + and S2 −, respectively.

2-s2.0-85007300841,"The objectives of this study were to monitor the changes in rice properties during aging and to compare kinetic parameters related to some of those changes. Paddy of three low amylose rice varieties was stored at ambient (30 ± 2ºC) and chilled (8 ± 2ºC) temperatures for 9 and 18 months, respectively. Aging led to a decrease in solid loss, peak viscosity, breakdown, and adhesiveness and an increase in head rice yield, minimum cooking time, water uptake, volume expansion, pasting temperature, final viscosity, through viscosity, setback, and hardness. Low temperature storage efficiently retarded those changes. Data of the time-dependent changes in hardness, adhesiveness, pasting temperature, peak viscosity, and breakdown of all samples stored at 30°C were fitted well with the first-order fractional conversion kinetic model (R2 = 0.77–0.98). Higher storage temperature resulted in greater rate constant (k; up to 9 times higher) of those changes. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Under stringent conditions, low-energy electron microscopy uncovers GaAs and InAs(110) surfaces on the brink of decomposition rapidly assemble planar wires of their cations in the «110» direction. For InP(110), wire formation is unfavorable due to a smooth decomposing front but can be assisted by Au nanoparticles (NPs), which sacrifice themselves to form rough pits via solid-liquid-vapor etching. The resulting self-assembled and AuNP-assisted NWs grow crystallographically in a self-sustainable manner, unless they are obstructed and consumed by stationary microdroplets, leaving emptied grooves. The findings reveal a hitherto hidden natural process on the surfaces of binary crystals capable of producing elementary submicron and nanoscale wires without extrinsic materials, paving the way for the controlled fabrication of planar NWs, grooves, and NW/groove arrays with lengths approaching circuits or even chips scale and with potential applications in self-integrated circuits, plasmonics, and fluidics. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85057524521,"OBJECTIVES: The Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) scoring system was developed to identify high-risk subjects for advanced neoplasia. However, the appropriate fecal immunochemical test (FIT) cutoff for high-risk population may be different from that of average-risk population. We aimed to evaluate the FIT performance at different cutoffs in high-risk subjects undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic subjects aged 50–75 years. Using the APCS score, subjects were stratified into either the average-risk or high-risk groups. All subjects were tested with one-time quantitative FIT and underwent colonoscopy. We compared the FIT performance for advanced neoplasia between two groups using different cutoffs (5 (FIT5), 10 (FIT10), 20 (FIT20), 30 (FIT30), and 40 (FIT40) μg Hb/g feces). RESULTS: Overall, 1,713 subjects were recruited, and 1,222 (71.3%) and 491 (28.7%) were classified as average-risk and high-risk, respectively. Advanced neoplasia was detected in 90 (7.4%) of the average-risk subjects and 65 (13.2%) of the high-risk subjects. In the high-risk group, by decreasing the cutoff from FIT40 to FIT5, the sensitivity increased by 33.8 percentage points with decreased specificity by 11 percentage points. In the average-risk group, the sensitivity increased by 20 percentage points with decreased specificity by 9.6 percentage points. At the lowest cutoff (FIT5), the number of needed colonoscopies to find one advanced neoplasia was 2.8 and 6.1 for the high-risk and average-risk groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using an appropriate FIT cutoff for CRC screening in high-risk subjects could improve CRC screening performance and reduce the unnecessary colonoscopies. To maintain high sensitivity and specificity for advanced neoplasia, the optimal cutoff FIT in the high-risk subjects should be lower than that in the average-risk subjects. © 2017 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

2-s2.0-85026361595,"Traffic road accidents are one of the leading causes of mortality in Nepal and around the world. Drivers in Nepal are not adequately educated about road safety rules. Road conditions are chaotic as traffic regulations are also not strictly enforced. Public safety campaigns may be able to alter drivers’ attitudes and behaviors; however, little is known about which persuasive strategies may be most effective. Drawing on self-determination theory and the Health Belief Model, the current study used a post-only experimental design to test the impact of a short video message. The video included collective vs. individual appeals, and messages emphasizing one’s ability to make the right choice (autonomy support) vs. directive language. Participants were Nepali college students (mean age 20, N = 199). Using structural equation modeling, the study found that directive messages rather than autonomy support influenced an individual seeing value in the recommended behavior (identified regulation), which in turn influenced perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and behavioral intention. The study also proposed a behavior change model by incorporating the stage of identification with the message upon exposure. This model aims to expand the model proposed by the Health Belief Model, to include a stage of value identification before cues to action influence perception of threat. Further implications are discussed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2-s2.0-85048559967,"Background: Maxillofacial injury is a common injury in trauma patients. The incidence, associated injuries and causes have been never reported for King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH). Objectives: To report the incidence, associated injuries, age groups, treatments, and behavioral risks in maxillofacial patients who were admitted to KCMH in the past decade. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive analysis of patients from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015, to evaluate the age groups, causes, sites of facial bone fracture, associated injuries, treatments, and behavioral risks. Results: There were 1,275 patients (79% male and 21% female). The most common age group was 21-30 years (30.6%), followed by 11-20 years (19.5%) and 31-40 years (18.8%). The most common cause of injury was motorcycle accident (39.7%), and the most common associated injury was head injury (58%). The total number of fractures were 1,526, with the most common fracture site being the zygomaticomaxillary complex (38.6%), followed by mandible (21.8%) and nasal bone (17.8%). Most fractures were treated using open reduction and internal fixation with plates and screws. Conclusions: The main cause of maxillofacial injury is motorcycle accident even though the government launched a policy named “Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020” to reduce road traffic deaths.

2-s2.0-85048524123,"Background: The Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQv2.1) is used to evaluate the impact of symptoms on the quality of life (QoL) of migraineurs. Objective: To evaluate primarily the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency, and secondarily the sensitivity to change of a Thai version of the MSQv2.1. Methods: The original English version of the MSQv2.1 was translated into a Thai version. The Thai version of the MSQv2.1 was assessed for content and language equivalence. Validity of the Thai version of the MSQv2.1 was assessed using migraine characteristics in a prospective study conducted at the Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Headache Centre of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were tested in migraineurs. Sensitivity to change was evaluated in another group of migraineurs using an 8-week follow-up. Results: We recruited 30 migraineurs to test the validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of the Thai version of the MSQv2.1 and 11 migraineurs to test its sensitivity to change. The Thai version of the MSQv2.1 scores were significantly correlated with migraine symptoms (inverse coefficient range from -0.62 to -0.39) except for associated symptoms, which had no correlation with any of the dimensions or overall QoL score. Spearman's correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.56-0.83, and Cronbach's a for internal consistency was 0.91-0.96. Headache, including average pain duration per attack, pain severity score (numeric rating scale), associated symptoms and dimensions, and overall QoL score of the Thai version of MSQv2.1 improved over time (P < 0.05). Moreover, improvement in headache correlated (coefficient range 0.67-0.77) with improvement in overall QoL score and some dimensions of the Thai version of the MSQv2.1 (coefficient range 0.66-0.77). Conclusion: The Thai version of the MSQv2.1 had validity, acceptable internal consistency, moderate-to-strong test-retest reliability, and strong correlation between improvement in headache severity and overall QoL score. A future study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up is required for better estimates of internal consistency and sensitivity to change. © 2017 Thanin Asawavichienjinda, Pongpat Vorasayan, Jirawadee Noiwattanakul, Kammant Phanthumchinda This Work is licensed under Creative Common License"
2-s2.0-85038256136,"The objective of this study was to find the optimal conditions for harpacticoid copepod cultivation at the laboratory scale. Harpacticoid copepods were collected from the macroalgae, Padina sp. and Amphiroa sp., and used to study the effects on their survival rates of temperature, salinity, diet, substratum and initial density. Mixed cultures of the dominant harpacticoid copepods (Families Harpacticidae and Laophontidae), were used for subsequent experiments. After 7 d, copepods reared at 30 °C showed the highest mean (±SE) survival rate (46.67 ± 5.85%; p < 0.05), followed by the copepods cultivated at 25 °C and 35 °C, respectively. Harpacticoid copepods could survive in brackish water to hyper-saline water, between 10 practical salinity units (psu) and 40 psu, but not in freshwater (p < 0.05). In addition, they also showed favorable results with salinity at 27 psu and 30 psu with mean survival rates of 44.72 ± 6.35% and 42.78 ± 4.94%, respectively, which were higher than the mean survival rate of 26.67 ± 13.33% recorded in salinity at 10 psu (p < 0.05). The feeding experiment was inconclusive since there were no significant differences between the survival rates of copepods on the different algal diets. On the other hand, copepods fed with commercial shrimp feed had the mean lowest survival rate (p < 0.05). No significant differences among the different sediment types were observed. However, harpacticoid copepods showed a preference for smaller-sized particles as higher survival rates were obtained for copepods reared in sand-silt sediment rather than in fine sand, coarse sand, vermiculite (artificial sediment) and no substrate. Culture at low densities such as 100 individuals/L and 500 individuals/L is suggested for initial cultivation based on this experiment. © 2017 Kasetsart University"

2-s2.0-85029428544,"Cholangiocarcinoma represents the second most common primary liver tumor after hepatocellular carcinoma. Mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid derived from Murraya koenigii (Linn.) Spreng, has been used as folk medicine in Thailand, where the liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma is common. The expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is maintained at immunohistochemically undetectable levels in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. To explore the regulation of MITF expression in the liver, we immunohistochemically analyzed the MITF expression using hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma specimens of the human liver cancer tissue array. MITF immunoreactivity was detected in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (6 out of 38 specimens; 16%) and cholangiocarcinoma (2/7 specimens; 29%). Moreover, immunoreactivity for glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1), a transcription factor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, was detected in 55% of hepatocellular carcinoma (21/38 specimens) and 86% of cholangiocarcinoma (6/7 specimens). Importantly, MITF was detectable only in the GLI1-positive hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, and MITF immunoreactivity is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequently, the effect of mahanine was analyzed in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and HuCCT1 and KKU-100 human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Mahanine (25 μ M) showed the potent cytotoxicity in these hepatic cancer cell lines, which was associated with increased expression levels of MITF, as judged by Western blot analysis. MITF is overexpressed in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, and detectable MITF immunoreactivity is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. MITF expression levels may be determined in hepatic cancer cells by the balance between the Hedgehog signaling and the cellular stress. © 2017 Tohoku University Medical Press."
2-s2.0-85029395456,"Perturbation of cell adhesion can be essential for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, but the current knowledge on the gene expression of molecules that mediate cell adhesion in canine oral tumors is limited. The present study aimed to investigate changes in the gene expression of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin or CDH1, syndecan 1 or SDC1, NECTIN2 and NECTIN4), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), in canine oral tumors, including benign tumors, oral melanoma (OM) and non-tonsillar oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. When compared with the normal gingival controls, decreased CDH1, SDC1 and NECTIN4 expression levels were observed in OSCC and OM, reflecting a possible role as cell adhesion molecules and tumor suppressors in canine oral cancers in contrast to the upregulation of MMP2 expression. Downregulated MMP7 was specifically revealed in the OM group. In the late-stage OM, the positive correlation of MMP7 and CDH1 expression was noticed as well as that of SDC1 and NECTIN4. Enhanced TIMP1 expression was shown in all tumor groups with prominent expression in the benign tumors and the early-stage OM. MMP14 expression was notable in the early-stage OM. Higher MMP9 and TIMP1 expression was observed in the acanthomatous ameloblastoma. In conclusion, this study revealed that the altered expression of cell adhesion molecules, MMP7 and MMP2 was correlated with clinicopathologic features in canine oral cancers whereas TIMP1 and MMP14 expression was probably associated with early-stage tumors; therefore, these genes might serve as molecular markers for canine oral tumors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The study was divided into 4 groups (male/female × short/middle) with 9 swimmers in each group. Each subject was tested for muscle strengths of 4 joints, which were, ankle, knee, shoulder and elbow. The muscle strengths were assessed using isokinetic dynamometer. Wingate and Bruce protocols were used to assess anaerobic and aerobic energy systems. Two-way ANOVA was employed to compare muscle strengths and energy systems. The results showed that gender main effect was more crucial than distance main effect. Male swimmers were stronger and had better anaerobic and aerobic energy systems than female swimmers, while short distance swimmers had similar muscle strengths, anaerobic and aerobic energy systems to middle distance swimmers. The results showed that only right shoulder extension and right ankle extension, short distance swimmers were different from middle distance swimmers. © JPES."

The data was recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 ± 0.5 fb-1. Events are selected with two oppositely charged leptons (l = e, μ) and two jets identified as originating from b quarks. The analysis is based on three kinematic observables whose distributions are sensitive to the value of Mt. An invariant mass observable, Mbl, and a ""stransverse mass"" observable, MT2, are employed in a simultaneous fit to determine the value of Mt and an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF). A complementary approach is used to construct an invariant mass observable, Mblν, that is combined with MT2 to measure Mt. The shapes of the observables, along with their evolutions in Mt and JSF, are modeled by a nonparametric Gaussian process regression technique. The sensitivity of the observables to the value of Mt is investigated using a Fisher information density method.

These PLA–NR copolymers acted as compatibilizers, which increased the strength at the PLA/NR interfaces, leading to the improvement in tensile strength, elongation at break, tensile toughness, impact strength, and tear strength. Although DCP did not influence the cold crystallization of PLA, TGA thermograms showed that thermal stability slightly increased owing to the enhanced interfacial adhesion. However, the addition of DCP at 0.005 and 0.010 phr resulted in a high content of cross-linked NR gel, by consuming the free radicals instead in copolymer formation. Therefore, the compatibilization efficiency was significantly reduced and the mechanical properties of reactive PLA/NR blown films finally dropped. Also, this poor interfacial adhesion facilitated the microvoid formation at the polymer–rubber interface as a result of mechanical stretching upon the film blowing process, increasing the permeation of water vapor and oxygen molecules. According to our study, it can be summarized that to optimize the morphology, mechanical properties, and gas permeation property of the free radical-assisted reactive blends, it is of great concern to carefully balance reactive compatibilizer formation and gel formation by adjusting the DCP content. © 2017, Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute."
2-s2.0-85027685036,"Feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is a common cancer with high metastatic potential and high mortality rate. Loss of cell–cell interactions and degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteinases enhances tumour invasion and metastasis. Peripheral neoplastic foci (PNF) are defined as the presence of discrete tumour cell clusters, splitting off from central neoplastic foci (CNF) and lodging around these CNF. PNF therefore locate at the tumour–host interface at the site of invasion. The aim of this study was to evaluate immunohistochemically the expression of cell adhesion molecules (e-cadherin [CDH-1], syndecan 1 [SDC-1] and nectin-2), matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9) and their tissue inhibitors (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase [TIMP]-1 and TIMP-2) together with the cellular proliferation marker, Ki67, in CNF and PNF of FMCs of different clinical stages and histological grades. Compared with control sections from areas of mammary gland hyperplasia, lower expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-2 was observed in all stages. Increased expression of TIMP-1 was observed in PNF in early-stage disease with no metastasis, while marked expression of CDH-1 and Ki67 occurred in late-stage FMC. In addition, the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in PNF of tumours with high histological grade (grade III) was higher than in low-grade tumours. The observed divergent protein expression in PNF could potentially form the basis of acting as novel markers in FMC. Potential markers may include the expression of TIMP-1 in PNF in early stage lesions, the expression of CDH-1 and Ki67 in late stages and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in high-grade tumours. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85047806052,"A search for supersymmetry is presented based on multijet events with large missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √s = 13 TeV. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. The analysis utilizes four-dimensional exclusive search regions defined in terms of the number of jets, the number of tagged bottom quark jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and the magnitude of the vector sum of jet transverse momenta. No evidence for a significant excess of events is observed relative to the expectation from the standard model. Limits on the cross sections for the pair production of gluinos and squarks are derived in the context of simplified models. Assuming the lightest supersymmetric particle to be a weakly interacting neutralino, 95% confidence level lower limits on the gluino mass as large as 1800 to 1960 GeVare derived, and on the squark mass as large as 960 to 1390 GeV, depending on the production and decay scenario. © 2017 CERN."
2-s2.0-85027522812,"Introduction: Mutations in the HSPB1 gene encoding the small heat shock protein B1 are associated with an autosomal dominant, axonal form of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 2F (CMT2F) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. Recently, distal myopathy had been described in a patient carrying HSPB1 mutation adding to the complexity of phenotypes resulting from HSPB1 mutations. Methods: Five patients in a family with concerns of hereditary neuropathy were included. Detailed clinical examinations, including assessments of motor and sensory function, and electrophysiological data were obtained. Genetic analysis was requested through a commercial laboratory. In vitro studies were carried out to assess the pathogenicity of the novel mutation found in this family studies. Results: All patients carried a novel mutation, c.146 C>T (p.T139M), substitution in the α-crystallin domain of HSPB1 causing a clinical phenotype with hyperreflexia and intrafamilial variability, from muscle cramps as the only presenting symptom to a classic CMT phenotype. In vitro studies showed that cells expressing HSPB1-T139M displayed decreased cell viability with increased expression of apoptosis markers. Moreover, overexpression of the mutant, not the wild-type HSPB1, caused formation of congophilic aggregates. Conclusions: In vitro findings strongly support the pathogenicity of this novel mutation. We propose that Congo red histochemical stain may serve as a simple screening tool for investigating if the aggregates in mutant cells have misfolded β-pleated sheet secondary structures. © 2017 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85027833617,"Bacterial cellulose and polyaniline was successfully combined to form a composite material. Polyaniline was inserted into the porous structure of the bacterial cellulose network. When an external electric field was applied, the polyaniline existed as a polar cluster. FTIR results illustrated the formation of an H-bond between a hydroxyl group and an amine group of the bacterial cellulose and polyaniline, respectively. XRD results showed that crystalline phase of composite was similar to neat bacterial cellulose. The composites also exhibited a uniform surface with an average roughness of 200 nm. They also presented an excellent thermal stability up to 300 °C. A preliminary experiment on the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties was evaluated. The remarkable characteristics of the composites demonstrate that they are a suitable candidate for use as dielectric materials in electronic devices.

Material and Method: Children aged 8 to 18 years who had no underlying disease and were discharged from the hospital for acute influenza LRI at least one year ago were studied. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) (spirometry, body plethysmography) and exercise stress tests were undertaken. Exercise-induced AHR was evaluated by serial spirometries after the maximal exercise. Results: Eighteen children (mean age 12.2±2.6 years, 67% male) were studied. The meantime interval after recovery from acute influenza LRI was 2.5±1.0 years. Fifty-six percent had acute influenza LRI at least two years ago. Abnormal PFT compatible with mild restrictive defect was found in one child who had H1N1-2009 influenza pneumonia 3.2 years ago. Maximal exercise was achieved in 15 children. Exercise-induced AHR was demonstrated in three (20%). All of them had acute influenza LRI more than two years ago. Conclusion: Residual lung function defect and AHR could be found in normal children who had acute influenza LRI more than one year ago.

However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength and physical performance remains unclear. This study will investigate the effects of vitamin D2 supplementation on muscle strength and physical performance in knee OA patients; (2) Methods: One hundred and seventy-five primary knee OA patients with low levels of serum 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) received 40,000 IU vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) per week for six months. Body composition, muscle strength, physical performance, serum 25(OH)D level, leptin, interlukin-6 (IL-6), parathyroid hormone (PTH), protein carbonyl, and metabolic profile were analyzed; (3) Results: Baseline mean serum 25(OH)D levels in knee OA patients was 20.73 ng/mL. Regarding baseline vitamin D status, 58.90% of patients had vitamin D insufficiency, and 41.10% had vitamin D deficiency. After vitamin D2 supplementation for six months, mean serum 25(OH)D level was 32.14 ng/mL. For post-supplementation vitamin D status, 57.10% of patients had vitamin D sufficiency and 42.90% had vitamin D insufficiency. From baseline to six months, there was a significant increase in mean serum 25(OH)D level (p < 0.001), while mean LDL cholesterol (p = 0.001), protein carbonyl (p = 0.04), and PTH (p = 0.005) all significantly decreased. Patient quality of life (SF-12) and pain (visual analog scale, VAS) both improved significantly from baseline to the six-month time point (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively). Knee OA patients demonstrated significant improvement grip strength and physical performance measurements after vitamin D2 supplementation (p < 0.05); (4) Conclusions: Vitamin D2 supplementation for six months reduced oxidative protein damage, decreased pain (VAS), improved quality of life, and improved grip strength and physical performance in osteoarthritis patients. © 2017 by the authors.

2-s2.0-85026326718,"Due to an insufficiency of fossil fuels and environmental pollution, sustainable and efficient material utilization has become the greatest importance. This work aimed to produce nanosized filler for biobased materials from renewable resource by an efficient production. Banana and tapioca starch nanocrystals (SNCs) were prepared from mild acid hydrolysis method. The effects of acid type, acid concentration, reaction time, and temperature on percent yield and degree of crystallinity were investigated in order to find the suitable condition for SNCs preparation. The chemical structure, degree of crystallinity, and morphology of the obtained SNCs were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Thermal properties were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results revealed that the suitable conditions for preparing SNCs were by using 3.5 M H2SO4 at 40°C for 7 hrs or 10 hrs depending on starch type, which leading to high degree of crystallinity as 47.13% and 60.06% for banana and tapioca SNCs, respectively. The particle size of both SNCs was less than 200 nm, approximately 30-70 nm. The banana SNC displayed parallelepiped nanoplatelets with C-type crystallinity, while the tapioca SNC showed spherical nanoplatelets with A-type crystallinity. The degradation temperature of banana and tapioca SNCs occurred in ranging between 280 and 310°C, which was lower than their native starches due to the disintegration of the SNC molecular chain during acid hydrolysis reaction. Nevertheless, melting enthalpy (ΔH) of SNC fillers enhanced after hydrolysis indicating that there was an increment of degree of crystallinity owing to the chain rearrangement of starch molecules. © Smithers Information Ltd, 2017."

This study aimed to determine the effects of an individualized nutrition counseling program (IC) matched with a transtheoretical model (TTM) for overweight and obese subjects. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty overweight and obese subjects aged 19-60 years with a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/m2 were enrolled in the weight reduction study. They were randomized into two groups: Intervention group received an IC matched with a TTM; control group received an educational handbook. Body weight (BW), body fat (BF), waist circumference (WC), waist to height ratio (WHtR), stages of change (SOC), processes of change (POC), food intake, and physical activity (PA) were assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after program initiation in both groups. All data were analyzed by intention-to-treat, using SPSS software for hypothesis testing. RESULTS: Forty-five female subjects were included in the 12-week trial at Ramkhamhaeng Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The results showed significant weight loss (1.98 ± 1.75 kg; 3% loss of initial weight) in the intervention group at 12 weeks, compared to a 0.17 ± 1.67 kg loss in the control group. There were significant differences between intervention and control groups in BF mass (-1.68 ± 1.78, -0.04 ± 1.62 kg); percentage BF (-1.54 ± 2.11, 0.08 ± 2.05); WC (-5.35 ± 3.84, 0.13 ± 3.23 cm); WHtR (-0.0336 ± 0.02, -0.0004 ± 0.02), and energy consumption (-405.09 ± 431.31, -74.92 ± 499.54 kcal/day) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Intragroup SOC was improved in both groups. The POC for the weight management action (WMA) process was significantly different with POC scores increasing by 16.00 ± 11.73 and 7.74 ± 14.97 in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. PA level did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The IC matched with a TTM resulted in reductions in BW, BF, and WC, thus reducing likely health risks by decreasing energy intake and inducing positive behavior changes while enhancing the WMA process. © 2017 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition."
2-s2.0-85026458809,"Cyanidin is a natural anthocyanidin present in fruits and vegetables with anti-diabetic properties including stimulation of insulin secretion. However, its mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of cyanidin for stimulatory insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Rat pancreatic β-cells INS-1 were used to investigate the effects of cyaniding on insulin secretion, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and gene expression. We detected the presence of cyanidin in the intracellular space of β-cells. Cyanidin stimulated insulin secretion and increased intracellular Ca2+ signals in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca2+ signals were abolished by nimodipine, an L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) blocker or under extracellular Ca2+ free conditions. Stimulation of cells with cyanidin activated currents typical for VDCCs and up-regulated the expression of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), Kir6.2, and Cav1.2 genes. Our findings indicate that cyanidin diffuses across the plasma membrane, leading to activation of L-type DCCs. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ stimulated insulin secretion and the expression of genes involved in this process. These findings suggest that cyanidin could be used as a promising agent to stimulate insulin secretion. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85026377756,"Background Cell-derived microparticles (MPs) are currently of great interest to screening transfusion donors and blood components. However, the current approach to counting MPs is not affordable for routine laboratory use due to its high cost. Aim The current study aimed to investigate the potential use of flow-rate calibration for counting MPs in whole blood, packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and platelet concentrates (PCs). Methods The accuracy of flow-rate calibration was investigated by comparing the platelet counts of an automated counter and a flow-rate calibrator. The concentration of MPs and their origins in whole blood (n = 100), PRBCs (n = 100), and PCs (n = 92) were determined using a FACSCalibur. The MPs’ fold-changes were calculated to assess the homogeneity of the blood components. Results Comparing the platelet counts conducted by automated counting and flow-rate calibration showed an r2 of 0.6 (y = 0.69x + 97,620). The CVs of the within-run and between-run variations of flow-rate calibration were 8.2% and 12.1%, respectively. The Bland–Altman plot showed a mean bias of −31,142 platelets/μl. MP enumeration revealed both the difference in MP levels and their origins in whole blood, PRBCs, and PCs. Screening the blood components demonstrated high heterogeneity of the MP levels in PCs when compared to whole blood and PRBCs. Conclusions The results of the present study suggest the accuracy and precision of flow-rate calibration for enumerating MPs.

This study aimed to describe the medication exposure and treatment satisfaction of patients presenting to gastroenterology clinics across a sampling of Asian cities. Methods: From March 2011 to October 2013, adult patients presenting to hospital-based gastroenterology outpatient clinics in 11 cities across Asia, who fulfilled screening criteria for any functional gastrointestinal disorder, were asked to complete a validated culturally adapted translation of the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire, a checklist of medications received in the preceding 3 months and questions on treatment satisfaction. Results: A total of 1376 patients (female 755, male 621, 41.36 ± 13.25 years) comprising irritable bowel (621, 45.1%), unspecified functional bowel disorder (372, 27.8%), functional constipation (202, 14.7%), functional bloating (144, 10.5%), and functional diarrhea (56, 4.1%) completed the study. Of 1105 patients with a previous consultation, 509 (46.1%) were dissatisfied with their treatment, with ineffective treatment being the commonest reason. Satisfaction with previous consultation was lowest by diagnosis for functional constipation (29.2%), and the most bothersome symptom was straining (37.5%). Of 1046 patients who had taken medications for their gastrointestinal symptoms in the last 3 months, 793 (75.8%) had received two or more drugs. For irritable bowel syndrome patients, treatment with proton pump inhibitors and antispasmodics was recorded in 57% and 31%, with overlapping epigastric pain and heartburn predicting proton pump inhibitors use.

2-s2.0-85025137496,"Purpose: Patients' perceptions of the effectiveness of a treatment, or perceived treatment effectiveness (PTE), play an important role in medicine. This study aimed to evaluate patients' PTE in dry eye disease (DED) and investigate factors contributing to these patients' perceptions. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 66 patients with DED. At enrollment, all patients had comprehensive ophthalmic assessment. In addition, to evaluate the patient's PTE, they were asked to use a 10-point scale ranging from ""strongly disagree (score 1)"" to ""strongly agree (score 10)"" to score their views on whether their DED treatments had been effective. Changes in clinical parameters of DED over time during their care were also evaluated retrospectively and correlated with the patients' PTE. Results: The mean age of patients was 55.7 years; 79% were women. Regarding patients' PTE, 36.4% strongly (score 10) and 53.0% moderately (scores 6-9) believed that their DED treatment had been effective. However, 10.6% thought that their treatment had not been effective (scores 1-5). Less favorable PTE for the DED treatment was significantly associated with a younger age (P < 0.001), current use of antidepressant medications (P = 0.01), and a higher Ocular Surface Disease Index score (P = 0.01) at enrollment. Conclusions: A majority of patients with DED have positive perceptions regarding the effectiveness of their treatments. Less favorable perceptions are associated with more severe ocular symptoms and nonocular parameters such as younger age and current antidepressant use. In DED management, assessing patients' PTE should be considered as an important part of clinical practice. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Inflammation has an established role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder, and minocycline has been shown to modify the immune-inflammatory processes and also reduce oxidative stress and promote neuronal growth. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial examined adjunctive minocycline (200 mg/day, in addition to treatment as usual) for major depressive disorder. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigated 200 mg/day adjunctive minocycline (in addition to treatment as usual) for major depressive disorder. Methods: A total of 71 adults with major depressive disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition) were randomised to this 12-week trial. Outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement and Clinical Global Impression-Severity, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, Social and Occupational Functioning Scale and the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool. The study was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register: www.anzctr.org.au, #ACTRN12612000283875. Results: Based on mixed-methods repeated measures analysis of variance at week 12, there was no significant difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores between groups. However, there were significant differences, favouring the minocycline group at week 12 for Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score - effect size (95% confidence interval) = -0.62 [-1.8, -0.3], p = 0.02; Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire score - effect size (confidence interval) = -0.12 [0.0, 0.2], p < 0.001; and Social and Occupational Functioning Scale and the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool score - 0.79 [-4.5, -1.4], p < 0.001. These effects remained at follow-up (week 16), and Patient Global Impression also became significant, effect size (confidence interval) = 0.57 [-1.7, -0.4], p = 0.017. Conclusion: While the primary outcome was not significant, the improvements in other comprehensive clinical measures suggest that minocycline may be a useful adjunct to improve global experience, functioning and quality of life in people with major depressive disorder.

In this study, 15 isolates of LAB from various sources in Thailand were examined for their probiotic properties. Based on their phenotypic and genetic characteristics, they belong to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Weissella. All isolates showed the ability to induce interleukin-12 (IL-12) at different levels. Cell-free supernatant of Lactobacillus acidipiscis SR7-1 and Lactobacillus farraginis SL4-1 showed an antiproliferative effect against Caco-2 cell lines with non-toxicity to normal cell lines (Vero cells), while they had no effect against U937 cell lines. Five strains, including Lactobacillus namurensis KC78-5, L. farraginis SL4-1, Lactobacillus mucosae SL7-2, Lactobacillus salivarius MSMC120-2 and Pediococcus pentosaceus PC73-3 grew at pH 3. All isolates were tolerant at 1% bile. L. farraginis SL4-1, L. mucosae SL7-2 and P. pentosaceus PC73-3 were not statistically different when compared to the negative control in vitro adhesion assay.

Methods This was a prospective study performed for 144 weeks among 51 treatment-naïve patients and 49 experienced patients on separate tablets of TDF, 3TC, and EFV with HIV RNA<50 copies/ml. CD4, HIV RNA, liver and renal function, and lipid profiles were assessed at baseline, weeks 12, 24, and 48, and then every 24 weeks. Results The median baseline CD4 cell count was 512 cells/μl for treatment-experienced patients and 230 cells/μl for treatment-naïve patients. Median baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA for treatment-naïve subjects was 4.9 copies/ml. From the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at week 48, 96, and 144 was 95%, 94%, and 94%, respectively, for antiretroviral-experienced patients and 88%, 90%, and 80%, respectively, for antiretroviral-naïve patients. One virological failure at week 12 had primary drug resistance of K70R, T69D, V75L. Three serious adverse events occurred (tension headache, infective endocarditis, and cervical dysplasia) and another three discontinued the study drug due to EFV intolerance.

2-s2.0-85021167536,"Mansorins and mansonones have been isolated from Mansonia gagei heartwoods, a traditional herbal medicine used to treat heart failure, and characterized to have anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-tumor, and anti-estrogenic activities. However, there is as yet no information on their effects on adipogenesis and lipid storage associated with heart disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of naturally occurring compounds on adipogenic differentiation and sought to develop more potent anti-adipogenic compound. We found that mansonone G (MG) suppressed adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, with a 40% decrease in lipid accumulation at 10 μM. MG derivatives including ether and ester analogues were then synthesized and assayed for their ability to suppress adipogenesis. A novel MG derivative, chlorobenzoyl MG (CBMG) most potently suppressed adipocyte differentiation with the decreased level of aP2 and adiponectin. Interestingly, CBMG treatment decreased the expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Further analysis confirmed that CBMG suppressed both the expression and activity of PPARγ, a master regulator of adipogenesis, and subsequently led to decreases in transcription of C/EBPα, aP2, and adiponectin in adipogenesis, thereby attenuating adipocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that a novel MG derivative, CBMG may have beneficial applications in the control of obesity through the suppression of PPARγ-induced adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Methods: One hundred post-Kasai BA patients and 40 controls were enrolled. Serum HSP70 levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver stiffness values were assessed by transient elastography. Results: BA patients had significantly higher serum HSP70 and liver stiffness values than controls. Serum HSP70 and liver stiffness values were markedly elevated in BA patients with jaundice compared to those without jaundice (P < 0.001). Furthermore, serum HSP70 was more elevated in BA children with portal hypertension than those without portal hypertension (35.1 ± 2.1 vs. 27.9 ± 2.5 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Moreover, serum HSP70 was positively correlated with serum aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.491, P < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.448, P < 0.001), total bilirubin (r = 0.303, P = 0.002), alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.414, P < 0.001), and liver stiffness values (r = 0.455, P < 0.001). There was a negative correlation between serum HSP70 and serum albumin (r = −0.434, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Serum HSP70 and liver stiffness values were higher in BA patients than controls. The increased serum HSP70 was correlated with hepatic dysfunction in BA. Consequently, serum HSP70 and liver stiffness could serve as non-invasive parameters reflecting the severity in post-Kasai BA. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
2-s2.0-85026264896,"Objectives: The objective was to compare urine protein, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPC) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) index between cats with idiopathic cystitis and clinically normal cats. Methods: Urine and blood samples were collected from 19 clinically normal cats and 19 cats with idiopathic cystitis without azotaemia at the time of first presentation. Urine protein, urine creatinine and UPC were measured. Additionally, the urinary NAG concentration was measured using the colorimetric method, and the NAG index was calculated by dividing the urinary NAG concentration by the urine creatinine ratio. Results: Urine protein concentration (mean ± SEM) was four times higher in cats with idiopathic cystitis (218.29 ± 58.95) than in clinically normal cats (56.13 ± 9.95) (P <0.05). The UPC (mean ± SEM) of cats with idiopathic cystitis (0.70 ± 0.19) was also five times higher than that of clinically normal cats (0.14 ± 0.02) (P <0.05). The mean ± SEM NAG index in cats with idiopathic cystitis (4.79 ± 1.53 U/g) was two times higher than that in clinically normal cats (2.14 ± 0.48 U/g). The log UPC was positively correlated with the log NAG index in cats with idiopathic cystitis at moderate levels (r2 = 0.512; P <0.05). Conclusions and relevance: Cats with idiopathic cystitis had increased amounts of urine protein and an increased UPC. Further study is needed to address the role of urinary NAG and its relationship with glycosaminoglycan levels in cats with idiopathic cystitis. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

The CaO and modified CaO were derived from oyster shell and employed as an additive in a zirconia-supported copper catalyst (Cu/ZrO2). The physical and chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, CO2-TPD, H2-TPD and XANES. The addition of oyster shell-derived calcium oxide promoters to the catalysts significantly improved their chemical properties and methanol synthesis possibly owing to impurities and defects in the crystal structure of natural calcium oxide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-85020837953,"Blending of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is an effective way to fine tune PLA brittleness. However, the immiscibility between these two polymers leads to product defects in terms of strength and clarity. The present work proposes a simple triblock copolymer, i.e. poly(L-lactide-b-butylene succinate-b-L-lactide) (PLLA-b-PBS-b-PLLA), as a multi-functional additive, i.e. compatibilizer, plasticizer, and nucleating agent for improving the PLA/PBS blend. Based on a critical content of PLA/PBS (at 80/20 wt%) which gives the opaque film, an addition of PLLA-b-PBS-b-PLLA induces drastic changes in crystallization behavior and mechanical properties. The ratio between PLLA and PBS block length, and the amount are the factors to fine tune the PLA/PBS blend. The PLLA40-b-PBS28-b-PLLA40 at 3 phr is an optimal condition to tune the blends with the decreases in glass transition temperature (Tg) (from ∼50 °C to ∼20 °C) as well as an increase in the elongation at break (for two-fold). At that time, the rapid co-crystallization of PBS and PLA in the blend as seen from the small and homogeneously dispersed spherulite results in a key performance to enhance the clarity of the blend film. The present work demonstrates how the block copolymer of PLA and PBS performs its multi-function for miscibility, toughness, and clarity of PLA/PBS blends. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85021245434,"The earthquake activities along the Indonesian Sunda Margin, which is delineated parallel to the Indonesian Island chain, were statistically investigated. Utilizing the obtained completeness earthquake catalogue, the mapped spatial distributions of the (i) possible maximum magnitude, (ii) return period, and (iii) probability of exceedance of an earthquake of a given magnitude revealed that the Indonesian Island chain could be classified into three different hazard level groups. The highest hazard level was located along the segment of Padang to Jakarta, surrounding Ambon, and northeastern Palu, whereas the southwestern Yogyakarta, southwestern Bajawa, and Dili, were classified as an intermediate hazard level. Although Makassar, southern Praya, southern Bajawa, and southeastern Dili was classified as a relatively low hazard area (compared to the other areas in the Indonesian Island chain), a major earthquake (7.0 Mw) is still likely to occur with 10–20% probabilities in the next 50 years. Therefore, the contribution of suitable local mitigation plans for both seismic and tsunami hazards are strongly recommended for all the different regions within the Indonesian Island chain. © 2017, The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
2-s2.0-85021197129,"Salt effect on the liquid phase equilibrium of the water-furfuryl alcohol-furfural system at 298.15 K was studied. The effects of salt concentration (1, 3 and 10% w/wNaCl) and type of salt (LiCl, KCl and RbCl) were investigated. The solubility and tie-line data of these systems were determined by experimental analysis. The results showed that addition of salt significantly affected the two-phase region of ternary system; the enlargement of two-phase region occurred with an increase of salt concentration in initial aqueous phase and the type of the salt in the following order: LiCl>NaCl>KCl>RbCl. Distribution coefficients and separation factors were also calculated. The reliability of the LLE experimental results was validated by the Othmer-Tobias equation, Hand equation and Bachman equation.

The proposed tube-based model predictive controller ensures that all possible realizations of the state trajectory lie in the time-varying tubes so robust stability and satisfaction of the state and input constraints are guaranteed. The time-varying tubes are computed off-line so the on-line computational time is tractable. At each sampling time, the precomputed time-varying tubes are included in the optimal control problem as the constraints in the prediction horizon and only a quadratic programming problem is solved. In comparison to the algorithm that calculates the time-varying tubes on-line, the proposed algorithm can achieve the same level of control performance while the on-line computational time is greatly reduced. © 2017, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-85019391328,"At present, strategies to disperse hydrophobic molecules in water without altering their chemical structures include conventional surfactant-based micellar and vesicular systems, encapsulation into water dispersible polymeric nanoparticles, and loading onto the surface of various metal nanoparticles. Here, we report a simple and low cost platform to incorporate hydrophobic molecules into a stable water dispersible nanostructure that can significantly increase the stability of the encapsulated materials. The platform is based on the incorporation of hydrophobic molecules into the self-assembled complex of gadolinium ion (Gd3+), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) called GdSH. After being incorporated, the two model hydrophobic dyes, curcumin and curcumin borondifluoride show approximately 50% and 30% improved stability, respectively. Investigation of the self-assembled 10–14 multilayered 60 nm spheres with inter-layer distances of 4.25 nm indicates coordination of SDS and HEPES with Gd3+. Incorporation of the hydrophobic molecules into the multilayered spheres results in reduction of the interlayer distance of the multilayer spheres to 4.17 nm, suggesting enhanced packing of the hydrophobic chain of SDS and HEPES around the Gd3+. The incorporation of the two curcuminoids into the self-assembled complex also causes an increase in fluorescence quantum yield of the two dyes, thus suggesting spatial confinement of the packed dye molecules. The better cellular uptake of the nanoparticles is responsible for the expected enhancement in fluorescence image of the encapsulated materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85019882967,"Abnormalities in the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion may cause oxidative stress and non-enzymatic glycation, resulting in an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Here, we performed a 14-week study to investigate the effects of ethanolic extract of Mori ramulus (MRE; 0, 800, and 1600 mg/kg body weight) and its signature component oxyresveratrol (OXY; 800 mg/kg body weight) on β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in C57BLKS/J db/db mice fed with a high-fat diet. Compared with the diabetic control group, the high-dose MRE group showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (p = 0.0024); a significant increase in insulin secretion as measured by insulin (p = 0.0012) and C-peptide (p = 0.0103) levels in plasma and insulin content (p = 0.0440) and homeobox factor-1 protein expression (p = 0.0148) in the pancreas; and a significant increase in insulin sensitivity as measured by insulin receptor mRNA expression in the liver (p = 0.0179) and adipose tissue (p = 0.0491). In addition, improvements in the reactive oxygen species level and inflammatory pancreatic and hepatic tissue damage were also observed in the MRE group as assessed by histological findings. A similar but weaker effect was found in the OXY group. Furthermore, we observed a potentiating effect of MRE and OXY on insulin secretion in INS-1 cells in the presence of 27 mM glucose, together with an anti-glycation effect as indicated by methylglyoxal-trapping capacity and inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation. Taken together, these data suggest that MRE could ameliorate β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance by reducing oxidative damage and advanced glycation end-product (Wagenknecht et al., 2003) formation and that these effects are due, at least in part, to OXY. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"
2-s2.0-85019700614,"This paper introduces the Engesser's first theorem to the area of structural similarity. General derivation of the scaling laws is described and applied to problem of symmetrical bending of elastic beam under simultaneous application of various loading types. The applied loads considered are concentrated forces, distributed forces, and self-weight load. New sets of complete similarity conditions and scaling laws are established, especially for the problem of nonlinearly elastic beams. It has been shown that the complete similarity condition can be achieved by a geometrically similar model or distorted model satisfying an additional condition. The scaling laws are verified by the problems of a nonlinearly elastic cantilever beam and linearly elastic 2-D frame, which the displacement solutions are determined by analytical and numerical approaches, respectively. These scaling laws are found to accurately predict the displacement of the prototypes in all cases. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85019260706,"The authors describe a two-step strategy for in-situ dispersive solid phase extraction (is-dSPE) of Cr(VI) ion (chromate) prior to its determination by using copper nanoclusters capped with 4,6-diamino-2-mercaptopyrimidine (DAMP-CuNCs) as a fluorescent probe. By emulating the formation of layered double hydroxides and taking advantage of their compositions, the extraction of chromate is accomplished by rapidly dispersing a suspension of mixed hydroxides of Mg2+ and Al3+ into the sample solution. After enrichment, chromate is directly quantified through selective quenching of the fluorescence of DAMP-CuNCs. This results from an inner filter effect caused by chromate only, while other anions have no effect. Under optimized conditions, the method has a linear response in the 1–7 μM chromate concentration range, and the lower limit of detection is 0.31 μM. The is-dSPE has improved detection sensitivity and has provided a highly selective response. It was successfully applied to the determination of chromate in (spiked) water samples, and the results agreed well with data obtained by ICP-OES.

According to the iterative test, the parameters r0 = 150 km and t0 = 3 y were suitable for detecting the precursory seismic quiescence along the SFZ. Consequently, with the implementation of these parameters and the present-day seismicity data of 1960–2015, the quiescence maps obtained indicated that western Myitkyina and the area in the vicinity of the Naypyidaw segments of the SFZ are at risk from future earthquakes.

In the first-stage study, temperature gradients from different potential heat or cold sources around individuals' daily lives were harnessed as power supplies for personal electronic gadgets. A primary prototype comprised four components including four bulk thermoelectric modules (with 127 thermoelectric-element couples per module). Its charging characteristics was evaluated under five conditions of use. It produced the maximum power of 4.82 W, and utilized the lowest starting temperature difference of 26°C. Thermoelectric-conversion charging using a constant-heat electric stove yielded charging characteristics comparisons among three prototypes and two commercial products in the second-stage study. Despite approximately 40% less Seebeck coefficient under the same experimental conditions, the prototype indicated competitive characteristics in battery charging comparison with higher output power and more charging efficiency in the first 45 min of charging of the lower temperature-difference condition. All prototypes, with competitive maximum unit cost of US$110, yielded maximum thermal-to-electric charging efficiency and boosted the converter's efficiency in the range of 3.8-4.8% and 60-78%, respectively. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The ovarian tissue sections were incubated with a polyclonal anti-leptin as a primary antibody. The immuno-staining in ovarian tissue compartments was calculated using imaging software. Leptin immuno-staining was found in primordial, primary, preantral and antral follicles. Leptin immuno-staining was expressed in the oocyte and granulosa and theca interna layers in both preantral and antral follicles. In the corpora lutea, leptin immuno-staining was found in the cytoplasm of the luteal cells. The leptin immuno-staining in the granulosa cell layer of preantral follicles did not differ compared to antral follicles (90.7 and 91.3%, respectively, P > 0.05). However, the leptin immuno-staining in the theca interna layer of preantral follicles was lower than antral follicles (49.4 and 74.3%, respectively, P < 0.001). There was no difference in leptin immuno-staining in the granulosa cell layer between follicular and luteal phases (92.4 and 89.7%, respectively, P > 0.05). However, the leptin immuno-staining in the theca interna layer of follicular phase was greater than that in the luteal phase (72.7 and 51.0%, respectively, P < 0.001). These findings indicated that leptin exists in different compartments of the porcine ovary, including the oocyte, granulosa cells, theca interna cells, corpus luteum, blood vessel and smooth muscles.

However, its hydrophobicity, poor bioavailability and stability limit its application in many biological approaches. In this study, Dam nanomicelles as an emerging platform were developed to overcome limitations. The deoxycholic and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether grafted chitosan (DCA-CS-mPEG) was synthesized and characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR and the degree of substitution (DS) was determined by elemental analysis (EA). This polymer formed self-assembled micelles with a core-shell structure and a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 37.2 μg/mL. Dam-loaded polymeric micelles were prepared by dialysis method and characterized by DLS, TEM, FTIR, DSC and HPLC. The mean particle size of Dam-loaded micelles was about 200 nm with spherical shape. The drug entrapment efficiency was up to 57.7%. FTIR and DSC analysis revealed that Dam was entrapped in the micelles in the amorphous state. The in vitro release profiles of Dam from micelles were sustained release and pH-sensitive behavior. Cytotoxic studies exhibited the comparable efficacy and safety of this delivery system. Overall these results indicate the possible utilization of DCA-CS-mPEG micelles as a promising carrier for hydrophobic compounds like Dam. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85017507304,"In this study, for the first time, we show how to formulate a structured support vector machine (SSVM) as two layers in a convolutional neural network, where the top layer is a loss augmented inference layer and the bottom layer is the normal convolutional layer. We show that a deformable part model can be learned with the proposed structured SVM neural network by backpropagating the error of the deformable part model to the convolutional neural network. The forward propagation calculates the loss augmented inference and the backpropagation calculates the gradient from the loss augmented inference layer to the convolutional layer. Thus, we obtain a new type of convolutional neural network called an Structured SVM convolutional neural network, which we applied to the human pose estimation problem. This new neural network can be used as the final layers in deep learning. Our method jointly learns the structural model parameters and the appearance model parameters.

2-s2.0-85016785863,"The effect of the quaternary ammonium chitin structure on the bactericidal activity and specificity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. Quaternary ammonium chitins were synthesized by the separate acylation of chitin (CT) with carboxymethyl trimethylammonium chloride (CMA), 3-carboxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (CPA) and N-dodecyl-N,N-(dimethylammonio)butyrate (DDMAB). The successful acylation was confirmed by newly formed ester linkage. All three derivatives had a higher surface charge than chitin due to the additional positively charged quaternary ammonium groups. The N-short alkyl substituent (methyl) of CTCMA and CTCPA increased the hydrophilicity whilst the N-long alkyl substituent (dodecyl) of CTDDMAB increased the hydrophobicity compared to chitin. Chitin did not exhibit any bactericidal activity, while CTCMA and CTCPA completely killed E. coli and S. aureus in 30 and 60 min, respectively, and CTDDMAB completely killed S. aureus in 10 min but did not kill E. coli after a 2-h exposure. Therefore, the N-short alkyl substituent was more effective for killing E. coli and the N-long alkyl substituent conferred specific bactericidal activity against S. aureus. © 2017"

We performed mutation analysis of HLH-associated genes in 25 Thai children using an exome sequencing method. Genetic variations found within these target genes were compared to exome sequencing data from 133 healthy individuals. Variants identified with minor allele frequencies <5% and novel mutations were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing data revealed 101 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all subjects. These SNPs were classified as pathogenic (n = 1), likely pathogenic (n = 16), variant of unknown significance (n = 12), or benign variant (n = 72). Homozygous, compound heterozygous, and double-gene heterozygous variants, involving mutations in PRF1 (n = 3), UNC13D (n = 2), STXBP2 (n = 3), LYST (n = 3), XIAP (n = 2), AP3B1 (n = 1), RAB27A (n = 1), and MAGT1 (n = 1), were demonstrated in 12 patients.

2-s2.0-85019205308,"We consider the conformally invariant cubic wave equation on the Einstein cylinder R× S3 for small rotationally symmetric initial data. This simple equation captures many key challenges of nonlinear wave dynamics in confining geometries, while a conformal transformation relates it to a self-interacting conformally coupled scalar in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS4) and connects it to various questions of AdS stability. We construct an effective infinite-dimensional time-averaged dynamical system accurately approximating the original equation in the weak field regime. It turns out that this effective system, which we call the conformal flow, exhibits some remarkable features, such as low-dimensional invariant subspaces, a wealth of stationary states (for which energy does not flow between the modes), as well as solutions with nontrivial exactly periodic energy flows. Based on these observations and close parallels to the cubic Szegő equation, which was shown by Gérard and Grellier to be Lax-integrable, it is tempting to conjecture that the conformal flow and the corresponding weak field dynamics in AdS4 are integrable as well. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85016236127,"Here, we aims to demonstrate a simple concept in biomaterials design by using natural resources solely as raw materials to fabricate elastic wound care dressing. Elasto-gel films comprise of silk sericin (SRC), natural rubber (NR), and chitin whisker (CTW) were developed. A glue-like protein SRC found in silk cocoons is beneficial for the treatment of wounds due to its superior skin moisturizing ability. However, the pure SRC film is generally difficult to be fabricated because of its weak structural feature. This limitation was overcome by using NR as a binder which consecutively rendered elasticity and strength of the films. CTW was chosen as another component to promote ability of the films for tissue restoration. Before the film formation, protein in the natural rubber latex (NRL) was removed to avoid allergic and cytotoxic problems. The enzyme-treated NR/SRC (ETNR/SRC) films having different blend compositions were fabricated by solution casting technique. The highest amount of the SRC to gain an easy to handle ETNR/SRC film was 30%. The ETNR/SRC/CTW films having 20% SRC were fabricated and studied in comparison. Essential properties of the films as elastic wound care dressings were investigated and effect of the materials chemistry on the observed properties were discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Eighty four patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls were assessed using the 12 item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating scale (FF) and scales for negative and positive symptoms, depression and anxiety. Cognitive functioning was tested using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Other assessments included: immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), namely quinolinic (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic (PA), xanthurenic (XA) and kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA). More than 50% of the patients studied had elevated levels of physio-somatic (PS) symptoms, significantly co-occurring with depression and anxiety, but not with negative or positive symptoms. PS symptoms were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, including increased IgA responses to 3 HK, PA and XA, and lowered IgA to QA and AA. Fatigue, muscle pain and tension, autonomic and cognitive symptoms and a flu-like malaise were strongly associated with cognitive impairments in spatial planning and working memory, paired associative learning, visual sustained attention and attention set shifting. PS symptoms in schizophrenia aggregate with depression and anxiety symptoms and may be driven by TRYCAT patterning of IgA/IgM-responses, with IgA indicating mucosal-mediated changes and IgM indicating regulatory functions. As such, the patterning of IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs may indicate differential TRYCATs regulation of neuronal and glia activity that act to regulate PS signalling in schizophrenia. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85015912542,"Industrial spent coffee grounds (IND-SCG) are a potential non-edible biodiesel feedstock due to their abundant global supply and high oil content. In this study, an in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE) was developed and scaled up for IND-SCG biodiesel production. Several hurdles must be overcome, including the high acid value, and wide range in particle size of IND-SCG. Washing IND-SCG with methanol reduced its high acid value with negligible loss of oil. Size reduction (0.25–1.68 mm) and an increase of the reaction temperatures (30–60 °C) were found to improve the biodiesel yield significantly. The whole deacidified IND-SCG was processed at 50 °C; and a maximum biodiesel yield of 77% was achieved within 3 h. The process was successfully scaled up for processing 4 kg IND-SCG per batch with a yield comparable to the 30-g scale. The IND-SCG biodiesel met the ASTM biodiesel standard in terms of total glycerin, water content, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability index (OSI), but its acid value exceeded the standard. A simple process modification using acidic water to neutralize alkaline catalyst during refining step, instead of strong acid, enabled the IND-SCG biodiesel to meet the standard for acid value. The oxidative stability index of the in-situ IND-SCG biodiesel was superior to that of the conventional process, probably due to the co-extraction of natural antioxidants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to delineate the association between DNA damage, DNA repair, the presence of polymorphic variants of BER genes, and occurrence of depression. The study was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 43 patients diagnosed with depression and 59 controls without mental disorders. Comet assay was used to assess endogenous (oxidative) DNA damage and efficiency of DNA damage repair (DRE). TaqMan probes were employed to genotype 12 SNPs of BER genes. Endogenous DNA damage was higher in the patients than in the controls, but none of the SNPs affected its levels. DRE was significantly higher in the controls and was modulated by BER SNPs, particularly by c.977C>G–hOGG1, c.972G>C–MUTYH, c.2285T>C–PARP1, c.580C>T–XRCC1, c.1196A>G–XRCC1, c.444T>G–APEX1, c.-468T>G–APEX1, or c.*50C>T–LIG3. Our study suggests that both oxidative stress and disorders in DNA damage repair mechanisms contribute to elevated levels of DNA lesions observed in depression. Lower DRE can be partly attributed to the presence of specific SNP variants. © 2016, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85011031971,"Objectives Triaxial accelerometry is commonly used to estimate oxygen uptake (VO2) and energy expenditure in health and fitness studies. We tested the correlation of a triaxial accelerometer in terms of a summation of vector magnitudes with gravity subtracted (SVMgs) and measured VO2 for different daily physical activities. Design Original research, cross-sectional. Methods Twenty volunteers wore a triaxial accelerometer on both wrists while performing 12 assigned daily physical activities for 6 min for each activity. The VO2 was determined by indirect calorimetry using a portable metabolic measurement system. The last 3 min of each activity was assumed to represent steady-state. The VO2 measured during these periods was averaged and converted into metabolic equivalents (METs). Results The range of VO2 for all activities was 0.18–3.2 L/min (0.8–12.2 METs). Significant differences in SVMgs existed between accelerometer placements on the dominant (120.9 ± 8.7 g min) versus non-dominant hand (99.9 ± 6.8 g min; P = 0.016) for the lowest levels of physical activity defined as <1.5 METs. Piecewise linear regression model using 6 METs as the transition point showed similar significant correlations for the non-dominant wrist (r2 = 0.85; P < 0.001) and the dominant wrist (r2 = 0.86; P < 0.001). Using the non-dominant wrist below 6 METs, the slope of the relationship between SVMgs and METs was 105.3 ± 4.3 (95% CI 96.9 to 113.7) indicating an increase in SVMgs of approximately 100 units for every MET increase in oxygen uptake. Conclusions Wrist-worn triaxial accelerometry reliably predicted energy expenditure during common physical activities <6 METs. More consistent correlations were found when the accelerometer was worn on the non-dominant wrist rather than the dominant wrist. © 2017 Sports Medicine Australia"
2-s2.0-84969988656,"In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) film, a high potential material used in biomedical applications, was treated by air plasma prior to a conjugation by carbodiimide cross-linking with various types of proteins, including type A gelatin, type B gelatin, and collagen hydrolysate. The properties of modified PCL films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement, and atomic force microscopy. The XPS results showed that oxygen and nitrogen atoms were successfully introduced on the air plasma-treated PCL surface. Primary amine was found on the air plasma-treated PCL films. All proteins were shown to be successfully cross-linked on air plasma-treated PCL films. The wettability and roughness of protein-conjugated PCL films were significantly increased compared to those of neat PCL film. In vitro biocompatibility test using L929 mouse fibroblast showed that the attachment percentage and spreading area of attached cells on all protein-conjugated PCL films were markedly increased. Comparing among modified PCL films, no significant difference on the attachment of L929 on modified PCL films was noticed. However, the spreading areas of cells after 24 hours of culture on type A gelatin- and type B gelatin-modified PCL surfaces were higher than that on collagen hydrolysate-modified surface, possibly related to the lower percentage of amide bond on collagen hydrolysate-conjugated surface compared to those on both gelatin-conjugated PCL ones. This indicated that the two-step modification of PCL film via air plasma and carbodiimide cross-linking with collagen-derived proteins could enhance the biocompatibility of PCL films. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To overcome this problem, this research proposes a new impurity measure called minority entropy, which uses information from the minority class. It applies a local range of minority class instances on a selected numeric attribute with Shannon’s entropy. This range defines a subset of instances concentrating on the minority class to be constructed by decision tree induction. A decision tree algorithm using minority entropy shows improvement compared with the geometric mean and F-measure over C4.5, the distinct class-based splitting measure, asymmetric entropy, a top–down decision tree and Hellinger distance decision tree on 24 imbalanced data sets from the UCI repository. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London."
2-s2.0-85027731124,"This paper presents a centralized 3-dimensional radio resources (namely, time, frequency, and power) allocation and scheduling approach for control-plane and user-plane (C-/U-plane) separation architectures for fifth generation mobile networks. A central station is considered where schedulers of all base stations (BSs) are located. We consider a multi-tier network that comprises of a macrocell BS (MCBS), several outdoor picocell BSs, and a number of indoor femtocell BSs (FCBSs) deployed in a number of multi-storage buildings. The system bandwidth is reused in FCBSs within each building orthogonally. In contrast to the conventional almost blank subframe, we consider a fully blank subframe based time-domain enhanced intercell interference coordination to split completely C-/U-plane traffic such that the control-plane can be served only by the MCBS and the user-plane of user equipments by their respective BSs. We propose two power management schemes for FCBSs based on whether or not the coordinated multi-point communication with joint transmission (JT CoMP) is employed during off-state of a FCBS and develop a power control mechanism for both a single user and multi-user per FCBS scenarios. An optimal value of average activation factor (OAF) for a FCBS is derived to trade-off its serving capacity and transmit power saving factor. It is shown that in order to improve the network capacity, a FCBS needs to operate at an average activation factor (AAF) greater than its OAF using JT CoMP to serve neighboring on-state FCBSs during its normal off-state, whereas at an AAF less than the OAF to improve the energy efficiency. With a system level simulation, we show that the capacity of a FCBS increases, whereas its power saving factor decreases linearly with an increase in its AAF because of serving increased traffic, and an OAF of 0.5 for the capacity scaling factor κ = 1/2 and greater than 0.5 for κ < 1 are found. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85014088299,"Notch signaling is regulated by mechanical stimuli in various cell types. It has previously been reported that intermittent compressive stimuli enhanced sclerostin (SOST) expression in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs) by regulating transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression. The aim of the present study was to determine the involvement of Notch signaling in the TGF-β-induced SOST expression in hPDLs. Cells were treated with intermittent compressive stress in a computer-controlled apparatus for 24 h. The mRNA and protein expression of the cells were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. In some experiments, the target signaling pathway was impeded by the addition of a TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor (SB431542) or a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT). The results demonstrated that hPDLs under intermittent compressive stress exhibited significantly higher NOTCH2, NOTCH3, HES1, and HEY1 mRNA expression compared with control, indicating that mechanical stress induced Notch signaling. DAPT pretreatment markedly reduced the intermittent stress-induced SOST expression. The expression of NOTCH2, NOTCH3, HES1, and HEY1 mRNA under compressive stress was significantly reduced after pretreatment with SB431542, coinciding with a reduction in SOST expression. Recombinant human TGF-β1 enhanced SOST, Notch receptor, and target gene expression in hPDLs. Further, DAPT treatment attenuated rhTGF-β1-induced SOST expression. In summary, intermittent compressive stress regulates Notch receptor and target gene expression via the TGF-β signaling pathway. In addition, Notch signaling participates in TGF-β-induced SOST expression in hPDLs. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2221–2230, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85027714760,"For bridge structures, the fatigue crack propagation represents the mechanical damage that shortens the service life of the structures. Most fatigue cracks initiate at the welded details due to geometric discontinuities, residual stresses, and initial weld defects. The welded transverse stiffeners have been widely used to increase shear strength of the steel girders. Under cyclic in-plane loadings, however, the fatigue crack initiates at the end of the stiffener, i.e., in the web gap, and propagates into the girder web. The objectives of this study are to (1) numerically simulate the fatigue crack propagation in steel I-girders with welded transverse stiffeners and (2) study the effects of initial crack size, fillet weld size, stiffener dimension, and web-gap length on the fatigue crack propagation. The FRANC3D software was used to perform the analysis of stress intensity factor, crack propagation, and fatigue life. The numerical results showed that the fatigue life increases as the web-gap length increases, while it decreases as initial crack size and thickness of the transverse stiffener increase. Also, the stress intensity factors of the steel I-beams that include the fillet weld in the finite element models are slightly lower than ones modelled without fillet weld. © 2017 Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85027727777,"The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the removal efficiency of bacteriophage Qβ using in-line coagulation with ceramic membrane filtration at different coagulant dosages, ceramic membrane pore sizes and initial bacteriophage Qβ concentrations. Raw water was collected from the Ping River, Chiang Mai, Thailand, and spiked with bacteriophage Qβ to prepare an initial concentration of 8x106 PFU/ml. According to the resulted, it was found that the smaller pore sizes membrane yield higher bacteriophage Qβ log removal. However, the use of a ceramic membrane alone could not remove bacteriophage Qβ completely. In-line coagulation combined with ceramic membrane filtration was conducted. The optimal polyaluminum chloride (PACl) doses for the 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 μm pore size membranes were 2.5, 2.0 and 1.5 mg-Al/L, respectively. Bacteriophage Qβ removal at the optimal PACl dose was more than 6.7 log in all cases. The results of effect of different initial bacteriophage Qβ concentration on the removal efficiency showed that in-line coagulation with ceramic membrane at all pore sizes can completely remove bacteriophage Qβ when the initial concentration was low (5x105 PFU/ml). However, the higher initial bacteriophage Qβ concentrations (4x106 and 8x107 PFU/ml) required a higher PACl dose to obtain effective bacteriophage Qβ removal. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85027700843,"To assess the post-fire or residual strength of fire-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) members, the most detrimental or peak temperature distribution within the members should be perceived. For RC beams, the residual flexural response is strongly influenced by the peak temperature experienced by the steel reinforcements. This paper presents a simplified two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear transient thermal analysis for the peak temperature distribution in RC beams using the finite element method. In the analysis, the thermal loading for heating was the ASTM E119 standard fire. After heating, a linear decrease in temperature was assumed for cooling. Three-sided fire exposure was assumed for rectangular RC beams. The analysis was used to investigate the effects of the heating period (1-4 h), cooling period (1-4 h), concrete cover thickness (30-50 mm) and aggregate type (carbonate or siliceous aggregates) on the peak steel temperature and delayed time (time to attain the peak temperature after heating). The numerical results showed that the temperature inside the beam section continues to rise after heating. The increases in steel temperature after heating and delayed time are influenced by the heating period, cooling period, location of steel reinforcement, and aggregate type. Such increase is significant for the beam with a thick concrete covering subjected to a short heating period followed by a long cooling period. At the longest (4 h) cooling and shortest (1 h) heating periods, the increases in steel temperature after heating in both carbonate and siliceous concrete beams are approximately 35, 50 and 75% for concrete cover thicknesses of 30, 40, and 50 mm, respectively. The carbonate concrete beams are more vulnerable to fire damage than siliceous ones when subjected to long heating and cooling periods. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1. All rights reserved."

In this study, month-long surface vector current data from the Upper Gulf, Central Gulf and Lower Gulf of Thailand (UGOT, CGOT, and LGOT, respectively) were analyzed and compared during a northeast (24 January-22 February 2015) and southwest (25 May-23 June 2015) monsoon to investigate seasonal patterns. Temporal averaging of surface currents at UGOT indicated no circulation pattern differences between seasons. Area averaging revealed that flow was strongly tidally influenced; however, a tidal influence was observed during the southwest monsoon at CGOT and LGOT. During the northeast and southwest monsoons at both CGOT and LGOT, residual current flowed in the northwest and northeast directions, respectively. Tidal ellipse analysis of diurnal (K1 and O1) and semi-diurnal (M2 and S2) tidal components demonstrated that the magnitude and rotation of each component differed from site to site and season to season. Overall, this study revealed that surface current patterns in the Gulf of Thailand changed from one season to another, provided evidence for changes in spring and neap tide signal (during monsoon events), and the possible existence of anti-cyclonic eddies (driven by monsoon events). © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

HA was introduced to blend with SF to enhance properties of the microspheres. The SF-based microspheres could be prepared by water in oil emulsion and glutaraldehyde crosslinking technique. The obtained microspheres contained 71-91% SF and 9-29% HA. The microspheres having higher SF content showed more stability and slower degradation rate. Then, to prove the potential of SFHA microspheres as carriers for drug delivery, curcumin was absorbed in the microspheres. All microspheres released curcumin in a controllable manner, possibly due to the hydrophobic interaction between curcumin and crystalline domain of SF. Furthermore, it was shown that HA was self-released from the microspheres. The GA-crosslinked SFHA microspheres that simultaneously and controlled released curcumin and HA could be further developed and applied as injectable drug delivery system for treatment of diseases e.g. arthritis. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

The correlations are decomposed into a jet component that dominates the short-range correlations (|Δη|<1), and a component that persists at large Δη and may originate from collective behavior of the produced system. The events are classified in terms of the multiplicity of the produced particles. Finite azimuthal anisotropies are observed in high-multiplicity events. The second and third Fourier components of the particle-pair azimuthal correlations, V2 and V3, are extracted after subtraction of the jet component. The single-particle anisotropy parameters v2 and v3 are normalized by their laboratory frame midrapidity value and are studied as a function of ηc.m.. The normalized v2 distribution is found to be asymmetric about ηc.m.=0, with smaller values observed at forward pseudorapidity, corresponding to the direction of the proton beam, while no significant pseudorapidity dependence is observed for the normalized v3 distribution within the statistical uncertainties. © 2017 CERN."

2-s2.0-85009765394,"In this paper, we address mainly 2 important issues, namely, characterizing co-channel interference and enforcing a minimum distance between femtocell base stations (FCBSs) for reusing resources in FCBSs deployed in a 3-dimentional multi-floor building. Each floor is modeled as a group of square-grid apartments, with one FCBS per apartment. We propose a simple yet reasonable analytical model by using planar-Wyner model for intra-floor interference and linear-Wyner model for inter-floor interference modeling in a 3-dimensional multi-floor building to derive a minimum distance between co-channel FCBSs for optimization constraints, namely, link level interference, spectral efficiency, and capacity. As opposed to orthogonal resource reuse and allocation (ORRA) where resources are reused once, using the proposed model, we develop 2 strategies for reusing resources more than once, that is, non-ORRA, within a multi-floor building. An algorithm of the proposed model is developed by including an application of the model to an ultra-dense deployment of multi-floor buildings. With an extensive numerical analysis and system level simulation, we demonstrate the capacity outperformance of non-ORRA over ORRA by manifold. Further, with a fairly accurate yet realistic estimation, we show that the expected spectral efficiency of fifth-generation networks can be achieved by applying the proposed model to an ultra-dense deployment of FCBSs.

2-s2.0-85019480651,"Bioethanol is an important renewable energy for transportation fuels in Thailand due to energy security it provides and the reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Cassava and sugarcane are considered to be the most important feedstocks that produce bioethanol in Thailand due to an abundant, renewable resource in the country. This study aims to evaluate the potential environmental performance and social impacts associated with the bioethanol supply chain. The environmental impacts of bioethanol in this study were assessed by using life cycle assessment method. The impact categories consisted of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, eutrophication potential (EP), direct land use change (dLUC), and water impact potential (WIP). The social impacts, including the total employment, wages and fatal occupational injury are carried out based on the process-based and input-output analysis approaches. The results showed that the GHG emissions of the bioethanol systems are 26–39 kg CO2eq/GJ, which is less than conventional gasoline. In addition, the results showed that the dLUC effect on the bioethanol production increased the GHG impact by 10–73%. However, it's found that the EP and water impact caused by bioethanol production is higher than for gasoline. In regards to the social aspects, the bioethanol production has advantages in term of total employment and income generation, the job creation is 15–18 times better than gasoline and the direct income distribution in the agricultural stage accounts for 30–45% of the total income in the bioethanol supply chain.

Here, we investigated the catalytic conversion of cellulose to lactic acid by using heterogeneous mixed-oxide catalysts containing ZrO2. Although pure ZrO2 has catalytic activity for the conversion of cellulose to lactic acid, the yield of lactic acid obtained is not satisfactory. In contrast, a series of ZrO2 –Al2 O3 catalysts containing various percentages of ZrO2 provided higher yields of lactic acid. The ZrO2 –Al2 O3 catalysts had more Lewis acid sites and far fewer base sites than ZrO2.

A commercial AC support was impregnated with Ce, Pd, Ru or Ni salts and calcined at 523 K to yield the 5 wt.% M/AC catalysts, which were then evaluated for their catalytic deoxygenation ability and selectivity towards desirable compounds. Without a catalyst, the main vapor products were fatty acids of 60.74% (area of GC/MS chromatogram), while aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds were presented at only 11.32%. Catalytic pyrolysis with the AC and the M/AC catalysts reduced the oxygen-containing (including carboxylic acids) products in the pyrolytic vapors from 73.68% (no catalyst) to 1.60–36.25%, with Ce/AC being the most effective catalyst. Increasing the Jatropha waste residue to catalyst (J/C) ratio to 1:10 increased the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon yields in the order of Ce/AC > AC > Pd/AC > Ni/AC, with the highest total hydrocarbon proportion obtained being 86.57%. Thus, these catalysts were effective for deoxygenation of the pyrolysis vapors to form hydrocarbons, with Ce/AC, which promotes aromatics, Pd/AC and Ni/AC as promising catalysts. In addition, only a low yield (0.62–7.80%) of toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was obtained in the catalytic fast pyrolysis (highest with AC), which is one advantage of applying these catalysts to the pyrolysis process.

However, the inherited alkaline contents from the pulping chemicals may affect the product yields and properties. In this research, the influence of the residual alkali on the product distribution via SCWG of soda BL and kraft BL was evaluated. The SCWG was performed in a batch quartz reactor for 10 min at various temperatures (673, 773 and 873 K) and pressures (250, 300 and 400 bar). The highest hydrogen (H2) production occurred at 873 K for the soda BL. The water–gas shift reaction with sodium ions played an important part in the H2 production, while only small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide were detected. Hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids and esters were the dominant substrates in the liquid products, which denoted the potential of this method for bond cleaving of the lignin macromolecule. As a result, BL, which typically contains alkali salt, was an appropriate feedstock for the SCWG reaction to produce renewable fuel.

2-s2.0-85025686173,"In this study, we report the effect of the commercial nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) on environmental bacteria, emphasizing the importance of nZVI-bacterial membrane interaction on nZVI toxicity as well as the adaptability of bacteria to nZVI. Exposure of Pseudomonas putida F1 to 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 g/L of nZVI caused the reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) substantially for almost 3 orders of magnitude. However, a rebound in the cell number was observed after the prolonged exposure except for 5.0 g/L nZVI at which bacterial viability was completely inhibited. Upon exposure, nZVI accumulated on and penetrated into the bacterial cell membrane. Cell membrane composition analysis revealed the conversion of the cis to trans isomer of unsaturated fatty acid upon short-term nZVI exposure, resulting in a more rigid membrane counteracting the membrane-fluidizing effect of nZVI. Several cycles of repetitive exposure of cells to 0.1 g/L nZVI induced a persistent phenotype of P. putida F1 as indicated by smaller colony morphology, a more rigid membrane, and higher tolerance to nZVI. A low interaction between nZVI particles and the surface of the nZVI-persistent phenotypic cells reduced the nZVI-induced membrane damage.

Copolymers of methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and a methacrylate-substituted dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) were spin-coated onto silicon substrates. The MPC units contributed biocompatibility and antifouling properties, and the DHLA units enabled cross-linking and the formation of robust thin films. Photolithography enabled the formation of 200-μm-wide poly(MPC-DHLA) stripped patterns that were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and rhodamine 6G staining. Regardless of the spacing between poly(MPC-DHLA) stripes (10, 50, or 100 μm), Escherichia coli rapidly adhered to the bare silicon gaps that lacked the copolymer, confirming the antifouling nature of MPC.

Results: During a median follow-up of 9 years (16274 person-year of follow-up), 123 patients developed new-onset diabetes mellitus, resulting in an incidence rate of 7.6 (95% confidence interval 6.3-9) per 1000 person-year of follow-up. From the multivariate models, age more than 35 years, male sex, BMI at least 25kg/m 2, family history of diabetes, abnormal waist circumference, lipodystrophy and exposure to didanosine were significantly associated with incident diabetes mellitus. The diabetes mellitus group had higher mortality rate (8.1 vs. 4.1%, P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion diabetes vs. nondiabetes patients developed cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (8.9 vs. 3.6%, P=0.008) or chronic kidney disease stage III (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60ml/min/1.73m 2) (15.3 vs. 1.9%, P<0.001) over total follow-up. Conclusion: In addition to traditional risk factors, lipodystrophy and use of didanosine were strongly associated with development of incident diabetes. Given the higher rate of cardiovascular-cerebrovascular complications and chronic kidney disease among patients with diabetes mellitus, careful assessment and appropriate management of diabetes mellitus are essential. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
2-s2.0-85019400555,"Avian malaria caused by Plasmodium gallinaceum is an important mosquito-borne disease. Eradication of this disease remains problematic since its competent vectors are diverse and widely distributed across the globe. Several mosquito species were implicated as competent vectors for this parasite. However, studies on vector competence for P. gallinaceum remain limited. In this study, vector competence in the two most predominant mosquito vectors in tropical countries, Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti, was compared. In order to determine their infection rates, Ae. albopictus (>F10), Ae. aegypti (>F10), and Ae. aegypti ([removed] F10) and Ae. aegypti ( > F10) and 40–60% by infected Ae. aegypti ([removed]F10) and Ae. aegypti (>F10) were highly competent vectors for P. gallinaceum infections. These mosquitoes play a crucial role in the transmission cycle of this parasite in nature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85022213503,"Background: The thermoneutral zone (TNZ) is a species-specific range of ambient temperature (T a), at which mammals can maintain a constant body temperature with the lowest metabolic rate. The TNZ for an adult mouse is between 26 and 34 °C. Interestingly, female mice prefer a higher T a than male mice although the underlying mechanism for this sex difference is unknown. Here, we tested whether gonadal hormones are dominant factors controlling temperature preference in male and female mice. Methods: We performed a temperature preference test in which 10-week-old gonadectomized and sham-operated male and female C57BL/6J mice were allowed to choose to reside at the thermoneutral cage of 29 °C or an experimental cage of 26, 29, or 32 °C. Results: All mice preferred a T a higher than 26 °C, especially in the inactive phase. Choosing between 29 and 32 °C, female mice resided more at 32 °C while male mice had no preference between the temperatures. Hence, the preferred T a for female mice was significantly higher (0.9 ± 0.2 °C) than that for male mice. However, gonadectomy did not influence the T a preference. Conclusions: Female mice prefer a warmer environment than male mice, a difference not affected by gonadectomy. This suggests that thermal-sensing mechanisms may be influenced by sex-specific pathways other than gonadal factors or that the thermoregulatory set point has already been determined prior to puberty. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85018624812,"Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the ethylene insertion pathway using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the absence and presence of electron donor (ED) systems on the (1 1 0) MgCl2 surface. The coadsorptions of four different EDs i.e. Si(OEt)mCln (m + n = 4) were investigated. The presence of Si(OEt)4 on the (1 1 0) MgCl2 surface with the preferential bidentate mode was found to have the strongest adsorption energy (ΔEads). The potential energy surface (PES) map indicated that the reaction mechanism of the ethylene insertion into the Ti[sbnd]C bond on the (1 1 0) Mg13Cl26.TiCl3-CH2CH3 surface is pseudo-concerted. As the differences in the intrinsic activation energies (ΔEa) obtained from all systems are so small, this energy cannot be used to fully explain the significant changes in the rates of the ethylene insertion reaction observed when an ED is employed. Here, the apparent activation energy (ΔΔEaa) was calculated using the PBE functional and the 6-31G(d, p) basis set for C, H, O, Mg and Cl, and the LANL2DZ basis set with an ECP function for the Ti atom. All EDs presented in this work in the ethylene insertion reaction can significantly reduce the apparent energy barrier when compared to an absence of any ED system. The obtained ΔΔEaa for the four ED complexes were found to decrease in the following order: SiOEtCl3 > Si(OEt)2Cl2 > Si(OEt)3Cl > Si(OEt)4. The obtained data lead to the conclusion that Si(OEt)4 is the most suitable ED to increase the productivity of PE in the presence of alkoxysilane. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85044572579,"The associations between proteins and diseases are crucial information for investigating pathological mechanisms. However, the number of known and reliable protein-disease associations is quite small. In this study, an analysis framework to infer associations between proteins and diseases was developed based on a large data set of a human protein-protein interaction network integrating an effective network search, namely, the reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) search. The RkNN search was used to identify an impact of a protein on other proteins. Then, associations between proteins and diseases were inferred statistically. The method using the RkNN search yielded a much higher precision than a random selection, standard nearest neighbor search, or when applying the method to a random protein-protein interaction network. All protein-disease pair candidates were verified by a literature search. Supporting evidence for 596 pairs was identified. In addition, cluster analysis of these candidates revealed 10 promising groups of diseases to be further investigated experimentally. This method can be used to identify novel associations to better understand complex relationships between proteins and diseases. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-85018318868,"The main objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of molecular structure of surfactant on surface properties and foam characteristics and to correlate surface tension to foam properties. Two series of methyl ester sulfonate with different alkyl chain lengths (MESx, x = 14, 16, and 18) and polyoxyethylated dodecyl alcohol with different head group sizes (C12EOn, n = 3, 5, 7, and 9) were measured for equilibrium and dynamic surface tension as well as foamability and foam stability. The equilibrium experimental data were well fitted with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The dynamic surface tension data were used to calculate diffusivity values of all studied surfactants by using Word-Tordai equation. The longer the alkyl group of MESx, the lower the diffusivity value. The larger the EO head group size, higher the diffusivity. For both studied surfactant groups, the higher the maximum rate of surface tension reduction, the higher the diffusivity and foaming properties in terms of foamability and foam stability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Jets are reconstructed with three different distance parameters (R=0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) for transverse momentum (pT) greater than 70GeV/c and pseudorapidity |η|<2. Next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamic calculations with nonperturbative corrections are found to overpredict jet production cross sections in pp for small distance parameters. The jet nuclear modification factors for PbPb compared to pp collisions, show a steady decrease from peripheral to central events, along with a weak dependence on the jet pT.

No evidence of an excess of events relative to the standard model expectations is observed. For a W′ boson described by the sequential standard model, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction and lower limits are established on the new boson mass. Masses below 4.1 TeV are excluded combining electron and muon decay channels, significantly improving upon the results obtained with the 8 TeV data. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the W′ production cross section and branching fraction are also derived in combination with the 8 TeV data.

It has therefore been used to investigate the structure and self-diffusion of carbon dioxide molecules in the MIL which is a candidate for membrane or adsorption application. The structure of the adsorbed phase shows different regions of high concentration. The highest particle concentration was found in the central regions of the channels. The self-diffusion coefficient slightly increases with the loading for low concentration of guest molecules while for higher concentrations it decreases because of mutual hindrance of guest molecules. © 2017

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 166μb−1 and 5.4pb−1 for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively. Differential production cross sections are reported as functions of ϒ rapidity y up to 2.4, and transverse momentum pT up to 20GeV/c. A strong centrality-dependent suppression is observed in PbPb relative to pp collisions, by factors of up to ≈2 and 8, for the ϒ(1S) and ϒ(2S) states, respectively. No significant dependence of this suppression is observed as a function of y or pT. The ϒ(3S) state is not observed in PbPb collisions, which corresponds to a suppression for the centrality-integrated data by at least a factor of ≈7 at a 95% confidence level. The observed suppression is in agreement with theoretical scenarios modeling the sequential melting of quarkonium states in a quark gluon plasma. © 2017 The Author(s)"

2-s2.0-85017359274,"Herein, we present a shape evolution of 3D flower-like gold microstructures (3D-FLGMSs) from gold nanosheets induced by H2O2 with the presence of starch. A systematic investigation of the influence of the parameters on the size, morphology and structural evolution of 3D-FLGMSs was presented. Under the starch-stabilized environment, H2O2 plays a key role on the formation of 3D-FLGMSs as it promotes a rapid generation of small nanosheets with starch-bound {111} facet at the very early stage. At a high concentration of H2O2, the nanosheets undergo oriented attachment and transform into a large primary gold nanosheets with imperfect facet-binding. The oriented attachment (OA) and subsequent epitaxial growth of nanopetals from the imperfects turns the primary nanosheets into 3D-FLGMSs with lateral size as large as 30μm within 120min. Without starch, quasi-microspheres of gold with diameters of 5–7μm are the sole product. In addition, the 3D-FLGMSs can be employed as SERS substrates which allow the detection limit of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) at the concentration as low as 0.1μM.

2-s2.0-85018181669,"Objectives: The Pan-Asian REVIVE survey aimed to examine women’s experiences with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and their interactions with health-care professionals (HCPs). Methods: Self-completed surveys were administered face-to-face to 5992 women (aged 45–75 years) in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Results: Of 638 postmenopausal women with GSM symptoms, only 35% were aware of the GSM condition, most of whom first heard of GSM through their physician (32%). The most common symptoms were vaginal dryness (57%) and irritation (43%). GSM had the greatest impact on sexual enjoyment (65%) and intimacy (61%). Only 25% had discussed their GSM symptoms with a HCP, and such discussions were mostly patient-initiated (64%) rather than HCP-initiated (24%). Only 21% had been clinically diagnosed with GSM and only 24% had ever used treatment for their symptoms. Three-quarters of those who had used treatment for GSM had discussed their symptoms with a HCP compared to only 9% of those who were treatment-naïve. Conclusion: GSM is underdiagnosed and undertreated in Asia. As discussion of GSM with HCPs appears to be a factor influencing women’s awareness and treatment status, a more active role by HCPs to facilitate early discussions on GSM and its treatment options is needed. © 2017 International Menopause Society."
2-s2.0-85016103239,"Objective: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Asia show distinctive differences from those in the western world. The gastrointestinal endocrine cells appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS. The present study aimed at studying the density of chromogranin A (CgA) cells in the large intestine of Thai and Norwegian IBS patients. Methods: Thirty Thai IBS patients and 20 control subjects, and 47 Norwegian IBS patients and 20 control subjects were included. A standard colonoscopy was performed in both the patients and controls, and biopsy samples were taken from the colon and the rectum. The biopsy samples were stained with hematoxylin–eosin and immunostained for CgA. The density of CgA cells was determined by computerized image analysis. Results: In the colon and rectum, the CgA cell densities were far higher in both IBS and healthy Thai subjects than in Norwegians. The colonic CgA cell density was lower in Norwegian IBS patients than in controls, but did not differ between Thai IBS patients and controls. In the rectum, the CgA cell densities in both Thai and Norwegian patients did not differ from those of controls. Conclusions: The higher densities of CgA cells in Thai subjects than Norwegians may be explained by a higher exposure to infections at childhood and the development of a broad immune tolerance, by differences in the intestinal microbiota, and/or differing diet habits. The normal CgA cell density in Thai IBS patients in contrast to that of Norwegians may be due to differences in pathophysiology. © 2017 The Author(s).

2-s2.0-85019200065,"A series of Mg–Al hydrotalcites (HTCs) calcined at different temperatures were evaluated for their suitability as solid base catalysts for the selective synthesis of trimethylolpropane triesters (TMPTEs) via transesterification of trimethylolpropane (TMP) with a mixture of C8–C10 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The effect of potassium fluoride (KF) loading of the calcined HTCs on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of the materials attained was ascertained. Using a 5 wt% catalyst loading and a FAME:TMP molar ratio of 3.5:1 at 170°C for 8 h, the Mg–Al mixed oxide obtained by calcining HTC at 500°C (HTC-500) gave the highest TMPTE selectivity and FAME conversion. Impregnating HTC-500 with 10 wt% KF (KF/HTC-500) generated strongly basic KMgF3, KOH, K2O, and coordinatively unsaturated F− sites. The FAME conversion and TMPTE yield obtained over different HTC and KF/HTC-500 catalysts depended on their total basicity, where a basic strength of 15 < H_ < 18.4 was required for optimal TMPTE selectivity. The KF/HTC-500 calcined at 500°C was the most suitable catalyst and showed a superior performance to NaOCH3, a common homogeneous base for the polyol ester production. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

A total of 144 male quail were divided into nine equal groups (A–I). Experimental feeds were offered to these groups containing different combinations of Cd chloride (Cd1: 150 and Cd2: 300 mg/kg feed), SL (250 mg/kg of feed), and MT (10 g/kg of feed). The duration of the experiment was 60 days. The physical parameters studied included feed intake and body weight. Hematobiochemical parameters included total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine, urea, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, and group means were compared by Duncan’s multiple range test. The body weight decreased significantly in Cd-treated groups while SL and MT ameliorated the toxic effects of Cd as compared to control group. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and hematocrit (Hct) values were decreased significantly in Cd2-treated group, while Hb and Hct decreased nonsignificantly in Cd1-treated group compared with control. Similar hematological findings were observed, when Cd was used in combinations with SL and MT. Urea, creatinine, and AST increased significantly, while ALT increased nonsignificantly in Cd-treated groups as compared to control group, while total protein, albumin, and globulin decreased significantly in Cd-treated groups as compared to control group. The SL and MT completely ameliorated these toxic effects at low dose of Cd; however, amelioration was partial at higher doses of Cd.

2-s2.0-85020703743,"Dolomite collected from Surat Thani Province in Thailand was investigated for use as a sorbent for the removal of divalent heavy metal cations from an aqueous solution. The sorbent had a surface area of 2.46 m2/g and a pH of zero point charge (pHzpc) of 9.2. Batch sorption was used to examine the effect of the pH (pH 3–7) on the sorption capacity of Cd2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+, alone or together as an equimolar mixture at various concentrations. Alone, each heavy metal cation was adsorbed faster at a higher pH, where the sorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ fitted a Langmuir isotherm, but Zn2+ sorption best fitted a Freundlich isotherm. Under equimolar competitive sorption, the sorption capacity of each cation was decreased by 75.8% (0.29–0.07 mM/g), 82.8% (0.53–0.09 mM/g), and 95.7% (0.84–0.04 mM/g) for Cd2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+, respectively, compared to that with the respective single cation. Desorption of these heavy metal cations from dolomite was low, with an average desorption level of 0.06–17.4%. Furthermore, since dolomite is readily available and rather cheap, it is potentially suitable for use as an efficient sorbent to sorb Cd2+ and Pb2+, and perhaps Zn2+, from contaminated water. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Thai offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of lexical tone processing during visual-word recognition, as tone is explicitly expressed in its script. We used colour words and their orthographic neighbours as stimuli to investigate facilitation (Experiment 1) and interference (Experiment 2) Stroop effects. Five experimental conditions were created: (a) the colour word (e.g., ขาว /khã:w/ [white]), (b) tone different word (e.g., ข่าว /khà:w/[news]), (c) initial consonant phonologically same word (e.g., คาว /kha:w/ [fishy]), where the initial consonant of the word was phonologically the same but orthographically different, (d) initial consonant different, tone same word (e.g., หาว /hã:w/ yawn), where the initial consonant was orthographically different but the tone of the word was the same, and (e) initial consonant different, tone different word (e.g., กาว /ka:w/ glue), where the initial consonant was orthographically different, and the tone was different. In order to examine whether tone information per se had a facilitative effect, we also included a colour congruent word condition where the segmental (S) information was different but the tone (T) matched the colour word (S–T+) in Experiment 2. Facilitation/interference effects were found for all five conditions when compared with a neutral control word. Results of the critical comparisons revealed that tone information comes into play at a later stage in lexical processing, and orthographic information contributes more than phonological information. © 2017, © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society."

The present study explored the preparation and characterization of pure silk fibroin (SF) filters and TiO2-coated SF filters for indoor air purification using waste silk cocoons generated from silk textile processing. Methodology: Silk fibroin (SF) filter samples were characterized mainly by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mechanical analyses. Results: The SEM results indicated that TiO2 particles adhered well onto the silk fibroin filters. Compared to pure SF filters, the mechanical and Co thermal properties of TiO2 SF filters were improved due to the conformational transition of silk fibroin to silk II structure. The percentage of catalyst (TiO2) doses varied from 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 % (wt.cat.-1 vol.sol.). The results derived from the kinetic model revealed that the photocatalytic rate followed the first order reaction. The highest removal efficiency of 68.21% was obtained at initial formaldehyde concentration of about 5.00 ppm and TiO2-coated SF filters of 5.0 % TiO2 wt.vol-1.sol.. The successful preparation of TiO2-coated SF filters from waste silk cocoons provide a promising opportunity to widen potential applications of SF in the biomaterial field. Interpretation: The successful preparation of TiO2-coated SF filters from waste silk cocoons not only provides a promising opportunity to widen potential application of SF in indoor air purification but also enhances a waste minimization from silk textile processing. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)"

2-s2.0-85039839552,"Background: Increased level of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 correlates with the severity of periodonti-tis. Yet, a possible role of IL-12 in periodontal disease has not been clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate whether IL-12 affects expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), a potent osteoclast-stimulating factor, by human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells. Methods: To determine the effect of IL-12, hPDL cells were incubated with recombinant human IL-12 (p70) in a dose-(0 to 10 ng/mL) and time-dependent manner. Expression of RANKL was evaluated at mRNA and protein levels. Underlying signaling pathways of IL-12 were deter-mined by using specific inhibitors. Results: Under the influence of IL-12, hPDL cells expressed significantly higher levels of RANKL. Expression was mediated by signal transducer and activator of tran-scription 4 and NF-kB signaling pathways. Conditioned me-dium of IL-12–incubated cells proved to contain molecule(s) that induced RANKL expression. Addition of suramin (G protein–coupled receptor inhibitor) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (calcium chelator) suggested existence of intermediate molecule(s) that could activate heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a calcium-dependent pathway. Conclusions: Expression of RANKL by hPDL cells significantly increased after IL-12 treatment. Therefore, this study supports a close interrelationship between immune and skeletal systems and suggests an osteolytic role of IL-12 in pathogenesis of periodontal disease. © 2022 American Academy of Periodontology."

The poly(2,2 -dimethyl-3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Me2) and polyaniline (PANI) also were electroactives and had good adhesion towards LSGO substrate. Our results primarily indicated that the PLA/LSGO/PProDOT-Me2 device offered an optical modulation, in which the color of the device switched from dark blue to a fully transparent state under the applied potential at 1 V within 5 s. In addition, the thin film of PANI had good stability and reversibility. The PBS/LSGO/PANI device had four different colors (yellow, green, blue and violet). This novel configuration presented an easy, expeditious and green way of preparing ECD. It was fabricated using a single-layer polymer. The LSGO in the flexible ECD demonstrated a potential for replacing indium tin oxide (ITO) in flexible electrochromic windows. © 2017, National Institute of Optoelectronics. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85041341419,"Thymidylate synthase (TS), a homodimer with two active sites near the dimer interface, plays a central role in DNA biosynthesis. Each active site is located on each subunit but shares a number of amino acid residues for catalytic activity. As TS is highly invariant across species, this has raised problems in designing inhibitors selective against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) TS, but not against the human (h) counterpart. However, there exists differences in amino acids at the TS interface of P. falciparum and human enzyme, which are critical for dimerization in each species. Here, we employed in vivo genetic complementation and 6-[3H]- FdUMP binding assays of transformants from TS-deficient Escherichia coli with a variety of pairs of inactive PfTS(R470) and inactive hTS(C195) mutants, and vice versa, to demonstrate none of the combinations formed active cross-species TS heterodimers. Visualization by structural superposition of TS from the two species revealed incompatible interface amino acids stemming from residues of different porality. Key residues at hTS dimer interface (Q62, Q211 and T251) and their equivalence in PfTS (I357, I506 and V546) could not be interchanged to generate active TS cross-species heterodimers using the co-transformation complementation assay. These results demonstrate that the TS interface of P. falciparum is unique and completely different from that of the human enzyme, suggesting that this domain provides a target for development of novel antimalarials. © 2017, SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

2-s2.0-85034973772,"Rice husk (RH) and rice husk ash (RHA) from Chipattana rice mill were studied in order to investigate the physical properties and methylene blue (MB) dye adsorption potential of RH compared with RHA residuals after gasification process. The structural observation using SEM expressed the enhancement of RHA porosity after underwent gasification process, in which coincided with the BET analysis. The BET specific surface area exhibited RH and RHA were 2.56 and 149.66 m2/g. The average pore diameter of RH was 3-fold greater than that of RHA which are 7.0 and 2.7 nm. However, the RH performed as a better adsorbent for MB dye removal with the efficiency at equilibrium 98.95%, while RHA was 92.70%. The study of concentration effect presented the adsorbed amount MB increased with the increase of MB initial concentration. The kinetic studies agreed with pseudo-second-order, while, the sorption process of RH corresponded to chemisorption process, but, RHA rather depended on the physicochemical mechanism. From isotherm study, RH and RHA adsorbents were well-fitted to Langmuir model; however, the sorption process of RH could possibly be influenced by an intraparticle diffusion mechanism. The results revealed a good potential to utilize RH and RHA residuals from Chaipattana Rice Mill Demonstration Center for dye removal without further modification process. © 2017, Mahidol University.

2-s2.0-85028923880,"Background: The concept of customer engagement and devotion has been applied in various service businesses to keep the customers with business However, a limited number of studies were performed to examine the context of customer engagement and devotion in pharmacy business which focus on the impact of customer perceptions about pharmacists, perceived quality of pharmacy structure, medication price strategy on pharmacy engagement and pharmacy customer devotion in a pharmacy providing pharmaceutical care to the customers. Objective: This study aimed to assess a conceptual model depicting the relationships among customer perceptions about pharmacists, pharmacy quality structure, medication price, customer engagement, and customer devotion. And also aimed to assess and measure if there is a direct or indirect relationship between these factors. Methods: A quantitative study was conducted by using self-administered questionnaires. Two hundred and fifty three customers who regularly visited the pharmacy were randomly recruited from a purposively selected 30 community pharmacies in Bangkok. The survey was completed during February to April 2016. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the direct and indirect relationships between constructs. Results: A total of 253/300 questionnaires were returned for analysis, and the response rate was 84%. Only perceptions about pharmacist in customers receiving professional pharmacy services was statically significant regarding relationship with pharmacy engagement (beta=0.45). Concurrently, the model from empirical data fit with the hypothetical model (p-value = 0.06, adjusted chi-square (CMIN/DF)=1.16, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI)=0.93, Comparatively Fit Index (CFI)=0.99, and Root Mean Square Error Approximation (RMSEA)=0.03). Conclusion: The study confirmed the indirect positive influence of customer perceptions about pharmacist on pharmacy customer devotion in providing pharmacy services via pharmacy engagement It was customer perceptions about pharmacist that influenced customer retention, positive word of mouth and constructive advice to pharmacies, not quality of pharmacy structure and medication price. To create a long term impact on community pharmacy business, pharmacist is the key success factor. © 2017 Grupo de Investigacion en Atencion Farmaceutica. All Rights Resreved."

The resultant SybilVote formulas produce outputs that are consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation and more accurate than the existing formula based on the multinomial distribution tail estimate. The computational complexity of SybilVote exact formulas is O((n + Sk, where n, k, and S are the number of real users, choices, and Sybil users, respectively. The accurate approximation formula of SybilVote is also presented with O(k) complexity by using a normal distribution approximation available when n and k are large in a large-population user voting condition.

2-s2.0-85027155837,"A Gram-stain-positive, lactic acid-producing bacterium designed strain MK21-7T, was isolated from tree bark collected from the north east of Thailand. This strain was a facultatively anaerobic spore-forming rod that was catalase-negative. It contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan and had seven isoprene units (MK-7) as the predominant menaquinone. Major fatty acids of MK21-7T were anteiso-C17 : 0, iso-C16 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and C18 : 1ω9c. Polar lipids were phosphatidglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unknown phospholipid, three unknown glycolipids and an unknown lipid. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that it represented a member of the genus Sporolactobacillus. MK21-7T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Sporolactobacillus terrae NBRC 101527T with 98.4% similarity and exhibited 97.6% similarity with Sporolactobacillus kofuensis NRIC 0334T, 97.5% with Sporolactobacillus laevolacticus NRIC 0361T, 97.3% with Sporolactobacillus nakayamae subsp. nakayamae NRIC 0347T and 97.1% with Sporolactobacillus nakayamae subsp. racemicus NBRC 101524T. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship based on 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequencing revealed that the position of MK21-7T was clearly separated from all related species of the genus Sporolactobacillus. It had low DNA–DNA relatedness (22.8–57.2 %) with S. terrae NBRC 101527T and related type strains. The DNA G+C content was 43.1 mol%. On the basis of the results of the phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic studies, MK21-7T should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Sporolactobacillus for which the name Sporolactobacillus shoreicorticis sp. nov. is proposed.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with dental caries in permanent dentition of Thai schoolchildren. We conducted a cross section study to evaluate the microbial and behavioral factors associated with caries by comparing children with and without caries. We randomly selected study subjects to determine their surface-specific dental caries counts using the decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS) index: socio-demographic data, snacking and oral care behaviors were determined using a self-administered questionnaire. The saliva of each subject was examined and tested for buffer capacity and level of salivary cariogenic bacteria [Streptococcus mutans (SM) and Lactobacilli (LB)]. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the potential determinants of the DMFS score. A total of 139 subjects were included in the study. The mean [± standard deviation (SD)] age of subjects was 13.4 (± 0.93) years. The study subjects had different brushing and snacking behaviors. The average (±SD) DMFS score was 7.65 (± 5.46). The factors significantly associated with caries were buffering capacity, level of salivary cariogenic bacteria and some oral care behaviors (brushing after lunch, brushing before bed and using fluoride toothpaste) (p <0.001). Caries prevention education in the study population should include education about quality of tooth brushing.

2-s2.0-85028467481,"The pulmonary neuroendocrine system includes pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) that are distributed throughout respiratory epithelium and regulate lung growth and maturation antenatally. Abnormalities in this system have been linked to many hypoxia-associated pediatric pulmonary disorders. Hemoglobin (Hb) Bart disease is a severe form of a-thalassemia resulting in marked intrauterine hypoxia with hydrops fetalis (HF) and usually death in utero. Affected fetuses can serve as a naturally occurring human model for the effects of intrauterine hypoxia, and we postulated that these effects should include changes in the pulmonary neuroendocrine system. Bombesin immunostaining was used to assess PNECs and NEBs in stillborn fetuses with Hb Bart HF (n=16) and with HF from other causes (n=14) in comparison to non-HF controls. Hb Bart HF showed a significant increase in the proportion of PNECs in respiratory epithelium (P = .002), mean number of NEB nuclei (P=.03), and mean size of NEBs (P=.002), compared to normal non-HF controls. Significant differences were not observed between HF due to other causes and non-HF controls with normal lungs. Non-HF controls with pulmonary hypoplasia showed significant increases in PNECs compared to HF cases not due to Hb Bart HF, implying HF alone does not cause such increases. In contrast, no significant differences were noted between non-HF controls with pulmonary hypoplasia and Hb Bart cases. Hb Bart HF may provide a useful model for studying the pulmonary neuroendocrine system under chronic intrauterine hypoxia. © 2017, Society for Pediatric Pathology All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85026540368,"An improvement in the method of automatic vehicle classification is investigated. The challenges are to correctly classify vehicles regardless of changes in illumination, differences in points of view of the camera, and variations in the types of vehicles. Our proposed appearance-based feature extraction algorithm is called linked visual words (LVWs) and is based on the existing technique bag-of-visual word (BoVW) with the addition of spatial information to improve accuracy of classification. In addition, to prevent over-fitting due to a large number of LVWs, four common sampling techniques with LVWs are investigated. Our results suggest that the sampling of LVWs using TF-IDF with grouping improved the accuracy of classification for the test dataset. In summary, the proposed system is able to classify nine types of vehicles and work with surveillance cameras in real-world scenarios. The classification accuracy of the proposed system is 5.58% and 4.27% higher on average for three datasets when compared with BoVW + SVM and Lenet-5, respectively. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T."
2-s2.0-85027855818,"Timely recognition of patients at risk or with possible acute kidney injury (AKI) is essential for early intervention to minimize further damage and improve outcome. Initial management of patients with suspected and persistent AKI should include thorough clinical assessment of all patients with AKI to identify reversible factors, including fluid volume status, potential nephrotoxins, and an assessment of the underlying health of the kidney. Based on these assessments, early interventions to provide appropriate and adequate fluid resuscitation while avoiding fluid overload, removal of nephrotoxins, and adjustment of drug doses according to the level of kidney function derangement are important. The judicious use of diuretics for fluid overload and/or in cardiac decompensated patients and introduction of early enteral nutritional support need to be considered to improve outcomes in AKI. Although these basic principles are well recognized, their application in clinical practice in low resource settings is often limited due to lack of education, availability of resources, and lack of trained personnel, which limits access to care. We report the consensus recommendations of the 18th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting in Hyderabad, India, on strategies to evaluate patients with suspected AKI and initiate measures for prevention and management to improve outcomes, particularly in low resource settings. These recomendations provide a framework for caregivers, who are often primary care physicians, nurses, and other allied healthcare personnel, to manage patients with AKI in resource poor countries. © 2017 International Society of Nephrology"

2-s2.0-85026477348,"Objective: The present study investigates the impact of quality of care (QoC) and other factors on chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage progression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods: This study employed a retrospective cohort from a nationwide Diabetes and Hypertension study involving 595 Thai hospitals. T2DM patients who were observed at least 2 times in the 3 years follow-up (between 2011–2013) were included in our study. Ordinal logistic mixed effect regression modeling was used to investigate the association between the QoC and other factors with CKD stage progression. Results: After adjusting for covariates, we found that the achievement of the HbA1c clinical targets (≤7%) was the only QoC indicator protective against the CKD stage progression (adjusted OR = 0.76; 95%CI = 0.59–0.98; p<0.05). In terms of other covariates, age, occupation, type of health insurance, region of residence, HDL-C, triglyceride, hypertension and insulin sensitizer were also strongly associated with CKD stage progression. Conclusions: This cohort study demonstrates the achievement of the HbA1c clinical target (≤7%) is the only QoC indicator protective against progression of CKD stage. Neither of the other clinical targets (BP and LDL-C) nor any process of care targets could be shown to be associated with CKD stage progression. Therefore, close monitoring of blood sugar control is important to slow CKD progression, but long-term prospective cohorts are needed to gain better insights into the impact of QoC indicators on CKD progression. © 2017 Sonthon et al.

To investigate whether shedding of certain human enterovirus (EV) is more frequently detected in the stool of individuals with AGE of unknown etiology than individuals without AGE symptoms, we tested fecal samples collected from 2,692 individuals with diarrhea between January 2010 and December 2016. Samples were tested for rotavirus, norovirus, and EV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and adenovirus by PCR. EV-positive samples were subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify EV species and types. Findings were compared to EV found in 1,310 fecal samples from individuals without AGE who were diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). While the majority of viruses identified in AGE consisted of human rotavirus (22.7%), norovirus (11.4%) and adenovirus (9.3%), we identified EV (6.2%) belonging mainly to species B, C, and rhinovirus. In contrast, >92% of EV found without AGE symptoms belonged to species A. Although AGE symptoms are not often attributed to EV infection, EV was associated with diarrhea of unknown etiology at least in 3.4% of AGE cases. While CV-A6 was most likely to be found in stools of HFMD patients, rhinovirus A and C were the two most common EV species associated with AGE. Elucidating group-specific EV infection in diseases with and without AGE will be useful in assisting identification, clinical management, and the surveillance of EV infection in the community. © 2017 Chansaenroj et al.

The soil samples demonstrated heavy metal concentrations in the following order: Fe > Mn >Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb (Cd was not detected), and the average concentrations of each metal in soil from the dumpsite area were higher than those in the surrounding area. The average concentrations of Mn in the soils exceeded the screening level for higher plant protection of the USEPA’s Eco-SSL while the average Zn and Cu concentrations in the soil samples from the dumpsite exceeded the level for good soil and safety to life recommended by LDD. The rice exhibited metal concentrations in the following order: root > straw > grain. A carcinogenic human health risk assessment (RTotal) indicated that the values from the soil samples and the rice were at safe levels. The sum of noncarcinogenic hazard values (Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) indicated that exposure to the soils around the dumpsite area may pose adverse health effects (HI < 1) while exposure to the soils in the dumpsite area carries a high risk of causing adverse health effects both in children (HI = 10.5) and adults (HI = 2.18).

2-s2.0-85026420414,"Objectives: This study aimed to identify the barriers female sex workers (FSWs) in Bangladesh face with regard to accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care, and assess the satisfaction with the healthcare received. Methods: Data were collected from coverage areas of four community-based drop-in-centers (DICs) in Dhaka where sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunovirus (HIV) prevention interventions have been implemented for FSWs. A total of 731 FSWs aged 15–49 years were surveyed. In addition, in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with 14 FSWs and 9 service providers. Respondent satisfaction was measured based on recorded scores on dignity, privacy, autonomy, confidentiality, prompt attention, access to social support networks during care, basic amenities, and choice of institution/care provider. Results: Of 731 FSWs, 353 (51%) reported facing barriers when seeking sexual and reproductive healthcare. Financial problems (72%), shame about receiving care (52.3%), unwillingness of service providers to provide care (39.9%), unfriendly behavior of the provider (24.4%), and distance to care (16.9%) were mentioned as barriers. Only one-third of the respondents reported an overall satisfaction score of more than fifty percent (a score of between 9 and16) with formal healthcare. Inadequacy or lack of SRH services and referral problems (e.g., financial charge at referral centers, unsustainable referral provision, or unknown location of referral) were reported by the qualitative FSWs as the major barriers to accessing and utilizing SRH care. Conclusions: These findings are useful for program implementers and policy makers to take the necessary steps to reduce or remove the barriers in the health system that are preventing FSWs from accessing SRH care, and ultimately meet the unmet healthcare needs of FSWs. © 2017 Wahed et al.

Thirty-two sediment samples in the top layers (0-10 cm) were analyzed to assess biochemical properties, sulfate and total sulfide contents. With an average±SD value of 0.62±0.36 mg/g, the total sulfide content from the study site was high compared to the southern part of Thailand. The distribution of sulfate content exhibited high values in nearby land area which gradually reduced in seaward discharges/runoff, whereas high concentrations of total sulfide were highlighted around the center of the study site and vertically accumulated in the top few centimeters of soil and decreased with depth. The most pronounced factor affecting the amount of sulfate and total sulfide content was organic matter, while pH, organic carbon, potassium, salinity, and sediment-mangrove conditions correlated with sulfate and sulfide at different levels. Total sulfides concentration can be considered as indicator of over nutrient-rich sediments for assessing environmental quality perhaps the die-back of mangroves.

This cosmic epoch is hence best suited for investigating the effects of radiative feedback from active galactic nucleus (AGN). Observational efforts are under way to quantify the impact of the AGN feedback, if any, on their host galaxies. Here, we present a study of the molecular gas content of AGN hosts at z ~ 1.5 using CO[2-1] line emission observed with Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) for a sample of 10 AGNs. We compare this with a sample of galaxies without an AGN matched in redshift, stellar mass and star formation rate. We detect CO in three AGNs with LCO ~ 6.3-25.1 × 109 L⊙, which translates to a molecular hydrogen gas mass of 2.5-10 × 1010M⊙ assuming conventional conversion factor of αCO ~ 3.6.

Several attempts at applying the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to extract roads from remote sensing images have been made; however, the accuracy is still limited. In this paper, we present an enhanced DCNN framework specifically tailored for road extraction of remote sensing images by applying landscape metrics (LMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). To improve the DCNN, a modern activation function called the exponential linear unit (ELU), is employed in our network, resulting in a higher number of, and yet more accurate, extracted roads. To further reduce falsely classified road objects, a solution based on an adoption of LMs is proposed. Finally, to sharpen the extracted roads, a CRF method is added to our framework.

2-s2.0-85022039832,"The government of Thailand attempts to alleviate rice farmers’ poverty through several public programs. One of the government's assistance programs is support for rice production. The “1,000 baht per rai program” aims to redistribute public money to help poor rice farmers reduce their production and cultivation costs. In implementation, however, this program suffers from inequality in granting access to the government's assistance program. This paper aims to explain the pattern of inequality in this government assistance program for rice farmers in rural Thailand. Conducting field research in the northern, southern, and central regions, the study found that rich rice farmers and landlords had more opportunity to access the government's assistance program than poor rice farmers and tenants. This has contributed to the state of inequality among rice farmers. The government should revise how the program is implemented and should limit this inequality among the beneficiaries. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization"
2-s2.0-85023773642,"Curcuma aff. amada is used for treatment of poisoning, detoxification and anti-inflammation in Thai folk medicine. However, there is no scientific evidence supporting the potential antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of this plant. To investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the ethanolic extract of Curcuma aff. amada rhizome (CAE) and to examine the mechanisms of actions underlying these effects, the antinociceptive effect of CAE was assessed in mice using hot-plate, acetic-acid induced writhing and formalin tests. The anti-inflammatory effect of CAE was investigated by evaluation of carrageenan-induced paw edema, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced paw edema, arachidonic acid-induced paw edema, and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation. To investigate the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action, paw tissues were examined histologically. Oral administration of CAE (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly increased hot-plate latencies and this effect was reversed by naloxone, indicating involvement of opioid receptors. CAE (12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced acetic acid-induced writhing and caused significant inhibition of formalin-induced paw licking in both phases. In anti-inflammatory tests, CAE at doses of 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly suppressed carrageenan-induced paw edema at 4, 5 and 6 h after carrageenan injection and showed significant activity against PGE2-induced paw edema. CAE failed to inhibit paw edema induced by arachidonic acid. Histological studies showed that all doses of CAE decreased infiltration of neutrophils induced by carrageenan. CAE at 200 mg/kg also inhibited cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation in mice. Taken together, these results show that CAE possesses both central and peripheral antinociceptive activities and has anti-inflammatory effects against acute and chronic inflammation with no obvious acute toxic effects. These data support the ethnopharmacological use of this extract for treatment of pain and inflammatory disorders. However, further evaluation of the safety profile of the extract is needed. © 2017, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85023613471,"Purpose Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is an emerging advanced radiation technique. Although dosimetric studies demonstrate the superiority of IMPT for improving target conformity and reducing unnecessary dose to critical normal tissues, clinical experience is limited. We aim to describe our preliminary experience implementing IMPT concurrently with chemotherapy in esophageal carcinoma (EC). Methods and materials From May 2011 through February 2016, 19 patients with EC (median age, 73 years) were treated with IMPT using 180 to 250 MV protons with a median dose of 50.4 Gy relative biological effectiveness in 28 fractions concurrently with chemotherapy. Beam arrangement was most commonly in the posteroanterior and bilateral posterior oblique beams. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess survival outcomes. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Results Single-field and multifield optimization was performed in 13 and 6 patients, respectively. The average gross tumor volume was 69.1 cm3; mean lung and heart dose delivered were 4.94 and 7.86 Gy, respectively; and the maximal spinal cord dose was 32.81 Gy. Clinical complete response was achieved in 84%. Only 4 patients underwent surgery. The most common grade 3 acute toxicities were esophagitis and fatigue (3 patients). Grade 3 esophageal stricture occurred in 1 patient. With a median follow-up time of 17 months, overall survival was 39.2 months, with 1-year overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates of 100%, 88.8%, and 72.9%, respectively. Locoregional and distant failures occurred in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. Conclusions IMPT is an effective treatment for EC, with high tumor response, good local control, and acceptable acute toxicity. © 2017 The Authors"
2-s2.0-85021846732,"Background: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a gold standard for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules. Recently introduced the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) has attempted to standardize reporting and cytological criteria in aspiration smears. This reporting format suggested six diagnostic categories, briefly defined as follows: 1) non-diagnostic, 2) benign, 3) atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), 4) follicular neoplasm, 5) suspicious for malignancy, and 6) malignant. Previous experience with thyroid FNA from Thailand was reported in several local publications, and none of these employed TBSRTC. Objective: To investigate the distribution of thyroid cytological diagnoses according to TBSRTC, to correlate FNA findings with the results of the histopathological examination, and to compare our results with available studies from Thailand. Material and Method: We reviewed all thyroid FNA reports between 2009 and 2015 performed at the KCMH. The FNA results were classified according to TBSRTC. Histopathology reports for operated cases were used to correlate cytology and final histopathology. Results: Two thousand seven hundred sixty two FNA of thyroid nodules from 2,004 patients were reviewed. The rate of non-diagnostic, benign, AUS, follicular neoplasm, suspected for malignancy, and malignant cases was 47.6%, 40.8%, 3.9%, 2.6%, 1.9%, and 3.2% respectively. Very high rate of non-diagnostic samples was likely attributed to performer’s skills, high prevalence of cystic nodules, and variations in microscopic interpretation. Malignancy rate in 457 operated thyroid nodules was 19.2%, 14%, 37.9%, 20.9%, 81.5%, and 93.6% for categories 1 to 6, respectively. Conclusion: The Bethesda system is recommended as a uniform system for reporting thyroid cytopathology, facilitating communication between pathologists and clinicians, leading to more consistent management algorithms. Additional efforts are needed to reduce the rate of non-diagnostic thyroid biopsies in the KCMH. There is substantial proportion of undetermined nodules (categories 3 to 5) that needs further stratification with ancillary techniques. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85021908629,"A search is presented for extra spatial dimensions, quantum black holes, and quark contact interactions in measurements of dijet angular distributions in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb−1. The distributions are found to be in agreement with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics that include electroweak corrections. Limits for different contact interaction models are obtained. In a benchmark model, valid to next-to-leading order in QCD and in which only left-handed quarks participate, quark contact interactions are excluded up to a scale of 11.5 and 14.7 TeV for destructive or constructive interference, respectively. The production of quantum black holes is excluded for masses below 7.8 or 5.3 TeV, depending on the model. The lower limits for the scales of virtual graviton exchange in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali model of extra spatial dimensions are in the range 7.9–11.2 TeV, and are the most stringent set of limits available.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, The Author(s)."

The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fb-1. The measurement is performed in the dilepton e ±μ∓ final state. The t t ¯ cross section is determined as a function of various pairs of observables characterizing the kinematics of the top quark and t t ¯ system. The data are compared to calculations using perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading and approximate next-to-next-to-leading orders. They are also compared to predictions of Monte Carlo event generators that complement fixed-order computations with parton showers, hadronization, and multiple-parton interactions. Overall agreement is observed with the predictions, which is improved when the latest global sets of proton parton distribution functions are used. The inclusion of the measured t t ¯ cross sections in a fit of parametrized parton distribution functions is shown to have significant impact on the gluon distribution. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."
2-s2.0-85021817350,"Objective: To investigate the association between ACE gene (I/D) polymorphism and the presence of macroalbuminuria among Thai patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and Method: A cross-sectional case control study included unrelated 188 Thai subjects with type 2 diabetes. Study subjects having diabetes for at least 10 years with normoalbuminuria and serum creatinine not exceeding 1.2 mg/dL were assigned as a control group (n = 94), and the study group was composed of type 2 diabetic patients who had macroalbuminuria (n = 94). The presence of ACE gene polymorphism was determined by PCR-gel electrophoresis. Results: The distribution of II, ID and DD polymorphism did not significantly differ between study and control groups (II: 20.2%, ID: 40.4%, DD: 39.4%; and II: 25.5%, ID: 43.6%, DD: 30.9%, respectively). There was also no significant difference between allele frequencies of the I allele: 40.4% and 47.3% and the D allele in the study and control group: 59.6% and 52.7%, respectively. Conclusion: A higher but not statistically significant frequency of D allele did not support an association in the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and macroalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes.

2-s2.0-85021195338,"The maturation process of high-affinity antibodies is a result of intricate interactions between B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells occurring in lymphoid germinal centers. HIV infection induces significant chronic immune activation, phenotypic skewing, and inflammation driven by years of continuous viral replication. High levels of viremia as well as immune activation and dysfunction have been demonstrated to have a perturbing impact on the B cell memory compartment and contribute to B cell exhaustion. Counterintuitively, the factors associated with perturbation of the B cell compartment seem to be favorable for the generation of highly affinity-matured Env-specific antibodies in a minority of HIV-infected individuals. Thus, the impact of HIV antigenemia on B cells and Tfh cell interactions warrants further exploration. We therefore studied immunophenotypes of HIV-specific B cells in individuals with differing levels of viral control using HIV Env gp120 probes and characterized the functionality of matched T cells in peripheral blood. While CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells were significantly diminished in HIV progressors, we found that a small subset of gp120-specific interleukin-21 (IL-21)-secreting CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells were significantly associated with gp120-specific B cell frequencies. In contrast, neither bulk CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells nor other HIV antigen specificities were associated with gp120-specific B cell levels. HIV-specific B cells derived from elite controllers displayed greater amounts of gp120-specific B cells in the resting memory subset, whereas HIV-specific B cells in progressors accumulated in tissue-like and activated memory subsets. Furthermore, CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells from elite controllers showed a stronger ex vivo capacity to induce B cell maturation and immunoglobulin class switching than cells from HIV progressors. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology."

In type IIB non-geometric compactifications, the resulting gauged supergravity has ISO(3) × ISO(3) gauge group and admits an N= 4 AdS 4 vacuum dual to an N= 4 superconformal field theory (SCFT) in three dimensions. We study various supersymmetric RG flows from this N= 4 SCFT to N= 4 and N= 1 non-conformal field theories in the IR. The flows preserving N= 4 supersymmetry are driven by relevant operators of dimensions Δ = 1 , 2 or alternatively by one of these relevant operators, dual to the dilaton, and irrelevant operators of dimensions Δ = 4 while the N= 1 flows in addition involve marginal deformations. Most of the flows can be obtained analytically. We also give examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions preserving N= 4 and N= 1 supersymmetries. These solutions should describe two-dimensional conformal defects within the dual N= 4 SCFT. Geometric compactifications of type IIA theory give rise to N= 4 gauged supergravity with ISO(3) ⋉ U(1) 6 gauge group. In this case, the resulting gauged supergravity admits an N= 1 AdS 4 vacuum.

2-s2.0-85021419886,"House dust mite (HDM) protease allergens, through cleavages of critical surface proteins, drastically influence the initiation of the Th2 type immune responses. However, few human protein substrates for HDM proteases have been identified so far, mainly by applying time-consuming target-specific individual studies. Therefore, the identification of substrate repertoires for HDM proteases would represent an unprecedented key step toward a better understanding of the mechanism ofHDMallergic response. In this study, phage display screenings using totally or partially randomized nonameric peptide substrate libraries were performed to characterize the extended substrate specificities (P5–P4ʹ) of the HDM proteases Der p 1, Der p 3 and Der p 6. The bioinformatics interface PoPS (Prediction of Protease Specificity) was then applied to define the proteolytic specificity profile of each protease and to predict new protein substrates within the human cell surface proteome, with a special focus on immune receptors. Specificity profiling showed that the nature of residues in P1 but also downstream the cleavage sites (Pʹ positions) are important for effective cleavages by all three HDM proteases. Strikingly, Der p 1 and Der p 3 display partially overlapping specificities. Analysis with PoPS interface predicted 50 new targets for the HDM proteases, including 21 cell surface receptors whose extracellular domains are potentially cleaved by Der p 1, Der p 3 and/or Der p 6. Twelve protein substrate candidates were confirmed by phage ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). This extensive study of the natural protein substrate specificities of the HDM protease allergens unveils new cell surface target receptors for a better understanding on the role of these proteases in the HDM allergic response and paves the way for the design of specific protease inhibitors for future anti-allergic treatments. © 2017 by the authors.

Methods: Thirty-six women, aged > 18 years, diagnosed as having overactive bladder (OAB) at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, with the symptoms of urgency, frequency with or without urge incontinence for more than 3 months, and at least three episodes of urgency with or without incontinence during the last 3 days prior to the study, were recruited during January 2010–May 2011. All cases received solifenacin 5-mg treatment once a day and were asked to record a 3-day micturition diary and to complete the Thai version of the OABSS, IPSS, and PPBC questionnaires at weeks 0, 4, and 12 after treatment. Results: The OABSS, IPSS, and PPBC scores and all parameters of the 3-day micturition diary had changed significantly by weeks 4 and 12. The OABSS correlated significantly with IPSS score (r = 0.44), PPBC score (r = 0.39), and urgency episodes (r = 0.48).

In this study, association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Activin type IIB receptor (LcActRIIB) and growth-related parameters of Asian seabass Lates calcarifer juveniles were examined by PCR-direct sequencing. Three SNPs (G>Ac.965+g.7, C>A>T c.965+g.33 and G>A c.965+g.189) generating seven composite SNP genotypes (diplotypes) were found in the LcActRIIB gene segment (398 bp). Among three identified SNPs, only a G>Ac.965+g.7 SNP showed significant association with growth traits (average body weight, total length, hepatic weight and hepatosomatic index) of examined fish (P < 0.01). Significant association between diplotypes and growth-related parameters were found. Juveniles exhibiting diplotypes I–V showed greater growth-related parameters than those exhibiting diplotypes VI (P < 0.001; N = 57).

2-s2.0-85020871557,"Terrestrial earthworms in the genera Amynthas Kinberg, 1867 and Metaphire Sims and Easton, 1972 are the most dominant and abundant earthworm species in Southeast Asia. However, the classification into species level of both genera is often confusing because of morphological similarities between species, a high level of morphological variability within species, and an absence of diagnostic characters in the juvenile stages. Therefore, similar morphological species can be erroneously lumped into a single species with several morphotypes or can be indicated as a species complex. In this study, we used a 658 bp DNA fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene for DNA barcoding for species identification and delimitation of terrestrial earthworms in the genera Amynthas and Metaphire collected primarily in Thailand, with additional samples from Laos and Malaysia. In total, 158 sequences from adult earthworms were investigated. Multiple DNA barcoding approaches revealed 77 candidate earthworm species (31 for Metaphire and 46 for Amynthas). Twenty-nine of these molecular operational taxonomic units, or species, corresponded with formerly described species, but the remaining were unknown species and probably new to science. The average K2P distance within species was 1%, whereas the average divergence between species was 20%, with a barcoding gap of around 5–13%, reflecting the obvious barcode gap in these animals. In addition, the possible cryptic speciation of Metaphire houlleti, Amynthas longiculicaulatus and Amynthas arenulus species complexes was supported. No morphological characters have yet been identified that can be used as diagnostic characters within these three species-complexes. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85019366307,"Amylomaltase catalyzes α-1,4 glucosyl transfer reaction to yield linear or cyclic oligosaccharide products. The aim of this work is to investigate functional roles of 410s loop unique to amylomaltase from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgAM). Site-directed mutagenesis of Y418, the residue at the loop tip, was performed. Y418A/S/D/R/W/F - CgAMs were characterized and compared to the wild-type (WT). A significant decrease in starch transglucosylation, disproportionation and cyclization activities was observed. Specificity for G3 substrate in disproportionation reaction was not changed; however, Y418F showed an increase in preference for longer oligosaccharides G5 to G7. The catalytic efficiency of Y418 mutated CgAMs, except for Y418F, was significantly lower (up to 8- and 12- fold for the W and R mutants, respectively) than that of WT. The change was in the kcat, not the Km values which were around 16–20 mM. The profile of large-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD) product was different; the principal product of Y418A/D/S was shifted to the larger size (CD36-CD40) while that of the WT and Y418F peaked at CD29-CD33. The product yield was reduced especially in W and R mutants. Hence Y418 in 410s loop of CgAM not only contributes to transglucosylation activities but also controls the amount and size of LR-CD products through the proposed hydrophobic stacking interaction and the suitable distance of loop channel for substrate entering. This is the first report to show the effect of the loop tip residue on LR-CD product formation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85019918519,"Background and Purpose: New effective recanalization therapies are currently available for acute ischemic stroke; yet a vast majority of stroke patients are left untreated. The lack of early recognition may be because often times, stroke patients present with atypical manifestations that resemble other conditions (which are referred to as ""stroke chameleons""). We set to study the proportion of patients with delayed stroke recognition in a single center. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data over a 9-year period. All adult patients discharged with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were identified and traced for their diagnosis on admission. Those cases with a diagnosis other than ischemic stroke or TIA on admission were identified as possible stroke chameleons and categorized into different groups according to the occurrence of neurological or non-neurological manifestations at presentation. Results: Of 2,303 cases with discharge diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA, 919 (39.9%) were found to be possible stroke chameleons. More than half of these patients (58.4%) presented with neurological manifestations including disorders of the somatic sensation (33%), alteration of consciousness (30%), and disorders of speech/language (11%). The remaining possible stroke chameleons had manifestations pertaining to other organ systems such as cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, systemic infection, trauma, and thromboembolic events elsewhere. Conclusions: In our cohort, a surprisingly large percentage of possible stroke chameleons was observed. It is important to confirm our findings, study the impact on clinical outcome, and develop strategies for early stroke patient recognition. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel."

The effects of the ESR reaction temperature, steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C), space–time (W/F), and Ni loading level on the reaction activity as well as H2 production and CNT-SF characteristics of the Ni-SF catalyst were investigated. The Ni-SF catalyst was highly effective at the simultaneous production of H2 and CNT. The optimized condition of the ESR in terms of the ethanol conversion and H2 yield was achieved at 600 °C, an S/C ratio of 9, and W/F of 18 gcat h mol−1 with a maximum H2 yield of 55%, while the best quality and quantity of the CNT (36%) formed along with a H2 yield of 29% was obtained at an Ni loading of 30 wt%, S/C ratio of 1, and W/F of 9 gcat h mol−1.

Aim: To determine the risk factors for gastric cancer in a population of patients with GIM to guide the appropriate clinical recommendations in a low prevalence area for gastric cancer. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Ninety-one patients with GIM diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 were recruited for surveillance EGD every 6-12 months until a diagnosis of gastric cancer or completion of the planned 5-year follow-up duration. Possible risk factors for gastric cancer were assessed. Results: At initial presentation, 81 of the 91 patients (89%) had complete GIM, whereas the remaining 11% had a study entry diagnosis of incomplete GIM. No cancer developed amongst patients with complete GIM. In contrast, five of the 10 patients exhibiting incomplete GIM (50%) progressed to high-grade dysplasia (n=2) or cancer (n=3). Male gender (P=.027), and incomplete GIM (P=.001) were associated with high-risk histology (dysplasia or cancer) by study end. A trend suggested a possible association with smoking (P=.08). Conclusion: Male patients and those with incomplete GIM are at greatest risk of developing dysplasia or early gastric cancer.

2-s2.0-85019662687,"Abstract: This study focused on the synthesis of hydrocarbon fuel containing a high iso-paraffin and very low oxygen content from palm oil using a mixed acid–base catalyst. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction, carbon dioxide- and ammonia-temperature programmed desorption as well as thermogravimetric analysis. Solid base (MgO, CaO, SiO2, and Na2SiO3) and solid acid (HY, H-beta, HZSM5, and Al2O3) catalysts were individually evaluated for their catalytic activity in a semi-batch reactor in terms of the deoxygenation level of palm oil product. The best acid and alkali catalyst were then selected for mixing at different weight ratios and re-tested for their tandem catalytic performance in terms of the deoxygenation activity. Finally, the reaction temperature (400–460 °C), pressure in a nitrogen or hydrogen gas atmosphere and residence time were optimized. The main components in the liquid product obtained were normal paraffins, iso-paraffins, olefins and aromatics. For the single base catalysts, a liquid yield of higher than 65 wt% was obtained at a 460 °C using MgO catalyst, which also realized an excellent oxygen removal through decarboxylation and decarbonylation. For the single acid catalysts, the zeolite beta catalysts reached a liquid yield of around 55 wt% with high iso-paraffin content. The optimal MgO:beta zeolite weight ratio for the acid–base hybrid catalyst was 3:1, which resulted in a low oxygen content in the products with a high iso-paraffin (35%) content. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien."
2-s2.0-85019121309,"In this work, methyl palmitate or palmitic acid methyl ester, a monoglyceride, was used as both a model solid fat below the melting point and as an oily soil above the melting point. An anionic extended surfactant [branched alcohol propoxylate sulfate sodium salt (C123-(PO)4-SO4Na)] was used to remove methyl palmitate from cotton and from polyester. Above the melting point (~30 °C) of methyl palmitate, the maximum oily soil removal was found to correspond to the lowest dynamic interfacial tension, as is common with liquid soils. Below the melting point, the lower the contact angle of the wash solution against the soil (indicating higher wettability), the higher the solid fat soil detergency. The removed methyl palmitate was found to be mostly in unsolubilized droplets or particles with a small fraction of micellar solubilization for both solid and liquid forms. The presence of surfactant can prevent the agglomeration of detached methyl palmitate particles in both liquid and solid forms, reducing redeposition and enhancing detergency. Below the melting point, the surfactant aids the solution wetting the surfaces, then penetrating the waxy solid, causing detachment as small particles, and dispersion of these particles. Unlike particulate soil detergency, electrostatic forces are not the dominant factor in fatty soil detergency. © 2017, AOCS."
2-s2.0-85018945638,"Introduction This study investigated the effects of acemannan, a polysaccharide from Aloe vera, on human deciduous pulp cells in vitro and the response after vital pulp therapy in dog deciduous teeth. Methods Human primary dental pulpal cells were treated with acemannan in vitro and evaluated for proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, type I collagen, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2), BMP-4, vascular endothelial growth factor, and dentin sialoprotein expression and mineralization. Osteogenesis-related gene expression was analyzed by complementary DNA microarray. Pulpal inflammation was induced in dog teeth for 14 days. The inflamed pulp was removed, retaining the healthy pulp. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: acemannan, mineral trioxide aggregate, and formocresol. Sixty days later, the teeth were extracted and evaluated histopathologically. Results Acemannan significantly increased pulp cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, BMP-2, BMP-4, vascular endothelial growth factor, and dentin sialoprotein expression and mineralization approximately 1.4-, 1.6-, 1.6-, 5.5-, 2.6-, 3.8-, 1.8-, and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with control. In vivo, partial pulpotomy treatment using acemannan generated outcomes similar to mineral trioxide aggregate treatment, resulting in mineralized bridge formation with normal pulp tissue without inflammation or pulp necrosis. In contrast, the formocresol group demonstrated pulp inflammation without mineralized bridge formation. Conclusions Acemannan is biocompatible with the dental pulp. Furthermore, acemannan stimulated dentin regeneration in teeth with reversible pulpitis. © 2017 American Association of Endodontists"
2-s2.0-85020165972,"Purpose To quantify the severity of ocular pain in patients with dry eye disease (DED) and evaluate factors associated with pain severity. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Eighty-four patients with DED were asked to score their severity level of ocular pain using a 10-point scale, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. All patients also had a comprehensive ophthalmic assessment including a detailed history, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, and ocular surface examination. Regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with ocular pain severity. Results The mean OSDI score was 45.6 ± 23.1. At least some degree of ocular pain (score >1) was reported by 88.1% of patients, including mild pain (scores 2–4) in 46.4%, moderate pain (scores 5–7) in 34.5%, and severe pain (scores 8–10) in 7.1% of patients. Ocular pain levels significantly correlated with the OSDI score (rs = 0.49, P <.001). Regression analysis showed that the severity of ocular pain had a significant association with use of antidepressant medications (P =.045) but not with tear breakup time, corneal fluorescein staining, or ocular medications used by patients. In patients without pain, a significant correlation was seen between OSDI and corneal fluorescein staining scores (rs = 0.67, P =.01). However, such a correlation was not observed in those with ocular pain. Conclusions A majority of patients with DED report some degree of ocular pain, which correlates only moderately with the OSDI score. Severity of ocular pain correlates with nonocular comorbidities such as use of antidepressant medications rather than with clinical signs of DED. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85018305585,"The present study reports outbreaks of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), an emerging pathogen causing syncytial hepatitis of tilapia (SHT), in farmed tilapia in Thailand. Occurrence of the virus was confirmed by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence homology to the TiLV from Israel. Diseased fish exhibited typical histopathological features of syncytial giant cells in the liver examined through H&E and semi-thin sections. Presence of intracytoplasmic viral particles was revealed by TEM. In situ hybridization using a specific DIG-labeled probe derived from a partial genome segment 3 of TiLV genome revealed multiple tissues tropism of the virus including liver, kidney, brain, spleen, gills and connective tissue of muscle. An alternative semi-nested RT-PCR protocol has been developed in this study for disease diagnosis. Additionally, comparative genetic analysis revealed genetic variations of Thailand-originated virus to the Israel TiLV strains, sharing 96.28 to 97.52% nucleotide identity and 97.35 to 98.84% amino acid identity. Outbreaks of TiLV in different continents might signal a serious threat to tilapia aquaculture globally. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85018853678,"In this paper, a finite-element-based computational method is proposed for time-dependent structural stability analysis of a concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) arch with uncertain parameters. Specifically, the targeted uncertainty includes the mercurial effects of the creep and shrinkage of the concrete core, which inevitably affect the structural performance of the CFST arch. The structural stability of the composite arch is systematically investigated under the influence of uncertain creep and shrinkage in a time-dependent fashion. The proposed computational scheme efficiently establishes the quantitative long-term stability envelope for CFST arches against uncertain viscoelastic effects. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed time-dependent structural stability analysis for CFST arches, practically motivated numerical examples are thoroughly investigated throughout this work. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."
2-s2.0-85017569167,"A series of novel boron-dipyrromethenes bearing β-benzo-fused rings, or benzo-BODIPYs, and phenyl, thienyl and bithiophenyl meso-substituents was synthesized, and investigated for their photophysical and electrochemical properties. Results from the UV–visible spectrophotometry revealed that the boron-complexation and the presence of the β-benzo-fused rings significantly increase absorptivity of the molecules in the longer wavelength region. Moreover, according to the observed electrochemical and photophyscial properties of these compounds, the extended conjugation system and the presence of thiophene-based meso-substituents in the target benzo-BODIPYs created great impact on the energy levels of the molecular frontier orbitals, resulting in narrowing of the energy gap of the materials. We have also demonstrated the use of density functional theory calculations to evaluate the performance of these compounds as dye sensitizers in solar cells. While all the molecules studied have their frontier orbitals aligned appropriately with respect to the band gap of TiO2, they are found to differ in their charge injection properties when anchored on TiO2, and even more markedly in electron-hole separation and change in dipole moment upon excitation. Upon combining these criteria using a simple model and the experimental results, the bithiophenyl-substituted benzo-BODIPY was suggested as the optimal candidate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85017453495,"This research was aimed to study physico-chemical properties and antioxidant activities of foam-mat dried germinated rice bean (Vigna umbellata) hydrolysate. Germination led to an increase in released phenolic content and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and FRAP) of rice bean hydrolysate. The hydrolysate obtained from germinated rice bean (GRB) and non-germinated rice beans (NGRBs) was foam-mat dried at 60 and 70 °C. Semi-theoretical and empirical model could suitably describe the drying characteristic of foamed bean hydrolysate. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of foam-mat dried samples decreased with increasing air-drying temperature (P ≤ 0.05). Gallic acid, catechol and epicatechin were major phenolic compounds in foam-mat dried samples prepared from both GRB and NGRB. The higher phenolic content and antioxidant activities were found in foam-mat dried hydrolysate of GRB. Electron spin resonance spectrometry revealed that foam-mat dried rice bean hydrolysate showed a strong ability to scavenge free radicals, especially carbon-centred radicals. © 2017 Institute of Food Science and Technology"
2-s2.0-85017371447,"Epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) of c-GaN films was attempted on the [110] mask-stripe-patterned GaAs (001) substrates by MOVPE. Growth features, crystal quality, and generation of hexagonal phase inclusion were investigated as a function of growth time as well as thickness. At a growth temperature of 900 °C and a fill factor of 0.8, smooth (111) sidewalls and (001) top surfaces continued for a longer growth time. This resulted in a large reduction of hexagonal phase inclusion, which was confirmed by X-ray reciprocal space mapping. To quantify the amount of hexagonal phase inclusion in the ELOG c-GaN films with large variation in thickness, the effects of GaN X-ray absorption and of the diffraction geometry were investigated. An amount of hexagonal phase inclusion as low as 3.1% was achieved at a growth time of 30 min (3.5 μm). The amount was found to decrease from 55.5 to 3.1% and 21.1%, when the film thickness increased from 1.4 to 3.5 μm and 12.0 μm, respectively. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim"
2-s2.0-85017130154,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of genetic factors including variants in HLA-B and CYP2C genes and non-genetic factors with phenotype-specific phenytoin (PHT)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Thai patients. Methods: Thirty-six PHT-induced SCAR cases (15 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and 21 drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS)) and 100 PHT-tolerant controls were studied. Variants in HLA-B, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 genes were genotyped. Fisher’s exact test and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to test the association of genetic and non-genetic factors with specific type of SCARs. Results: Multiple logistic regression models showed that genetic and non-genetic factors associated with PHT-induced SCARs were specified to its phenotype. HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*56:02/04, CYP2C19*3, and omeprazole co-medication were strong risk factors of DRESS/DHS (adjusted OR = 13.29, p = 0.0001; adjusted OR = 56.23, p = 0.0007; adjusted OR = 6.75, p = 0.0414; and adjusted OR = 9.21, p = 0.0020, respectively). While CYP2C9*3 and having Chinese ancestry were significant risk factors of SJS (adjusted OR = 10.41, p = 0.0042 and adjusted OR = 5.40, p = 0.0097, respectively). Combined genetic and non-genetic risk factors optimized sensitivity and increased specificity for predicting PHT-induced SCARs. Conclusion: This study showed that distinct genetic markers were associated with phenotype-specific PHT-induced SCARs. Non-genetic factor, omeprazole co-medication, was strongly associated with PHT-induced DRESS/DHS in addition to variants in HLA-B and CYP2C genes. Combined markers may be better predictors for PHT-induced SCARs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-85018591368,"Indoor climate control of thermal comfort for humans in a residential or commercial building is a major component of building energy management. The goal of optimal temperature and humidity control is to ensure indoor comfort with minimal energy consumption. Model-Based Predictive Control (MBPC) is considered to be one of the most suited solutions to achieve this goal due to its ability to use building dynamics, occupancy schedule, and weather conditions for optimal control. The development and verification of MBPC have been discussed in the Part I [1]. Here, to validate that MBPC achieves reduced energy consumption, while simultaneously satisfying comfort conditions, experiments are performed on a quarter scale shelter structure in a climate-controlled environmental chamber. The MBPC method is compared to three other control methods: conventional constant temperature setpoint control, scheduled control using a Honeywell smart thermostat, and scheduled control using Labview. Temperature variations and energy consumptions resulting from the four methods are analyzed. Compared to the three other methods, MBPC yields superior control performance with lowest energy consumption while still maintaining indoor thermal comfort. We also demonstrate that use of MBPC can reduce the number of sensors required for effective local control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85016508942,"Oxyresveratrol is a major active compound in the heartwood of Artocarpus lacucha. It plays an important role in anti-tyrosinase, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and neuroprotective properties. There are many A. lacucha commercial products available on the market for skin whitening and anti-aging effects. To evaluate the quality of raw material from the plant, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against oxyresveratrol was generated in this study. The immunogen was prepared by the Mannich reaction for the conjugation of oxyresveratrol and cationized bovine serum albumin (cBSA). The conjugation of oxyresveratrol–cBSA at a ratio of 1:50 was used for the immunization. The novel MAb (E4) was specific to oxyresveratrol and resveratrol. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the MAb (E4) was developed for the determination of oxyresveratrol. The linear range for the measurement of oxyresveratrol was 63–500 ng/mL and the precision (% relative standard deviation) was found to be <10% with the percentages of recovery from 95.93−103.55%. According to the validation analysis, the established ELISA can be applied for the determination of oxyresvertrol in the heartwood of A. lacucha and samples of the traditional drug Puag-Haad.

2-s2.0-85019219681,"Purpose To determine sensitivity and specificity of laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (LS-IVCM) for detection of filamentous fungi in patients with microbial keratitis and to evaluate the effect of observer's imaging experience on these parameters. Design Retrospective reliability study. Methods This study included 21 patients with filamentous fungal keratitis and 24 patients with bacterial keratitis (as controls). The etiology of infection was confirmed based on the response to specific therapy regardless of culture results. All patients had undergone full-thickness corneal imaging by a LS-IVCM (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 with Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). The images were evaluated for the presence of fungal filaments by 2 experienced observers and 2 inexperienced observers. All observers were masked to the clinical and microbiologic data. Results The mean number of images obtained per eye was 917 ± 353. The average sensitivity of LS-IVCM for detecting fungal filaments was 71.4% ± 0% for the experienced observers and 42.9% ± 6.7% for the inexperienced observers. The average specificity was 89.6% ± 3.0% and 87.5% ± 17.7% for these 2 groups of observers, respectively. Although there was a good agreement between the 2 experienced observers (κ = 0.77), the inexperienced observers showed only a moderate interobserver agreement (κ = 0.51). The LS-IVCM sensitivity was higher in patients with fungal infections who had positive culture or longer duration of the disease. Conclusions Although LS-IVCM has a high specificity for diagnosing filamentous fungal keratitis, its sensitivity is moderate and highly dependent on the level of the observer's experience and training with this imaging modality. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85016183732,"The Lao population mostly relies on out-of-pocket expenditures for health care services. This study aims to determine the role of community-based health insurance in making health care services accessible and in preventing financial catastrophe resulting from personal payment for inpatient services. A cross-sectional study design was applied. Data collection involved 126 insured and 126 uninsured households in identical study sites. Two logistic regression models were used to predict and compare the probability of hospitalization and financial catastrophe that occurred in both insured and uninsured households within the previous year. The findings show that insurance status does not significantly improve accessibility and financial protection against catastrophic expenditure. The reason is relatively simple, as catastrophic health expenditure refers to a total out-of-pocket payment equal to or more than 40% of household income minus subsistence. When household income declines as a result of inability to work due to illness, the 40% threshold is quickly reached. Despite this, results suggest that insured households are not significantly better off under community-based health insurance. However, compared to uninsured households, insured households do have better accessibility and a lower probability of reaching the financial catastrophe threshold. © SAGE Publications."

The aim of this research was to evaluate the ability of free Candida rugosa and Yarrowia lipolytica rM-4A yeast cell cultures, as a single yeast strain and as a co-culture, as well as their crude extracellular enzyme preparations, to reduce the total phenolic compounds, triglycerides and chemical oxygen demand (COD) level in palm oil mill effluent (POME) that contains high amounts total phenolic compounds (9783 mg L−1) and oil and grease (7762 mg L−1). Culture with Y. lipolytica rM-4A effectively reduced the total phenolic content in undiluted POME, resulting in removal of 36% of the total phenolic content after 96 h. The highest removal of triglyceride (98.5%) and COD (60.3%) were observed in undiluted POME treated by the co-culture of C. rugosa and Y. lipolytica for 120 h. Triglyceride was removed rapidly by the extracellular lipase produced by C. rugosa, reaching 93% degradation after 48 h.

2-s2.0-85015369550,"The relative importance of sarcopenia and its individual components as independent predictors of mortality in the dialysis population has not been determined. We estimated whole-body muscle mass using pre-dialysis bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements in 645 ACTIVE/ADIPOSE-enrolled prevalent hemodialysis patients from San Francisco and Atlanta. Low muscle mass was defined as two standard deviations below sex-specific means for young adults from NHANES and indexed to height2, body weight, body surface area, or body mass index. We evaluated the association of sarcopenia (low muscle mass) by four indexing methods, weak hand grip strength, and slow gait speed with mortality. Seventy-eight deaths were observed during a mean follow-up of 1.9 years. Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for covariates. No muscle mass criteria were associated with death, regardless of indexing metrics. In contrast, having weak grip strength or slow walking speed was associated with mortality in the adjusted model. Only gait slowness significantly improved the predictive accuracy for death with an increase in C-statistic from 0.63 to 0.68. However, both gait slowness and hand grip weakness significantly improved the net reclassification index compared to models without performance measures (50.5% for slowness and 33.7% for weakness), whereas models with muscle size did not. Neither sarcopenia nor low muscle mass by itself was a better predictor of mortality than functional limitation alone in patients receiving hemodialysis. Thus, physical performance measures, including slow gait speed and weak hand grip strength, were associated with mortality even after adjustment for muscle size and other confounders. © 2017"

Among the studied oxidizing agents, H2O2 was found to be the best choice in terms of appreciable molecular weight reduction without major change in chemical structure of the degraded products of chitosan. By the combination with SP treatment, dilute solution of H2O2 (4–60 mM) was required for effective degradation of chitosan. The combination of SP treatment and dilute solution of H2O2 (60 mM) resulted in the great reduction of molecular weight of chitosan and water-soluble chitosan was obtained as a major product.

2-s2.0-85014315476,"Melanization mediated by the prophenoloxidase-activating system (proPO) is an important immune response in invertebrates. However, in addition to melanin, the proPO system produces reactive intermediates that are not only harmful to the invading microbes but also to the host cells. Thus, the proPO system must be tightly regulated by several inhibitors. Previously, a melanization inhibition protein from the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon, PmMIP, has been identified and preliminarily characterized. In this study, we investigate the function of PmMIP in the regulation of the proPO system in shrimp. When challenged with the bacterium Vibrio harveyi, the expression of PmMIP transcripts in gills was down-regulated dramatically at 24 h but recovered after 48 h post infection (hpi), while the PmMIP protein level in shrimp plasma was decreased at 6 hpi but recovered at 24 hpi. Double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing of PmMIP suppressed both PmMIP transcriptional and translational levels and resulted in increased hemolymph phenoloxidase and proteinase activities compared to controls injected with GFP dsRNA or NaCl. Furthermore, the recombinant PmMIP protein successfully expressed in Escherichia coli was able to inhibit hemolymph PO activity by 50%. These results suggested that PmMIP was involved in the proPO system by acting as a negative regulator and interfering with hemolymph proteinase activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

There are, however, no firm data regarding these biomarkers in chronic SCZ. Therefore, this study aimed to delineate O&NS biomarkers in patients with chronic SCZ. 125 outpatients with SCZ and 118 controls were enrolled. The markers included lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) and paraoxonase 1 (PON-1) activity. Immune-inflammatory markers known to be altered in SCZ were also measured: leptin, IL-6, soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-Rs) and the chemokines CCL-11 and CCL-3. There were no significant associations between chronic SCZ and the O&NS markers (AOPP, NOx, LOOH) and the anti-oxidants PON-1 and TRAP. Leptin, sTNF-R, CCL-3 and CCL-11 were significantly higher in SCZ. There were significant associations between pro-inflammatory and O&NS biomarkers (leptin/CCL-8 and AOPP; IL-6 and NOx; CCL-3 and LOOH; CCL-3/IL-6/NOx and TRAP). In conclusion, there were significant intercorrelations between inflammatory and O&NS pathways, which play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic SCZ.

The primary endpoint, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from randomization to month 12, was similar for everolimus versus CNI: mean (standard error) 0.3(1.5) mL/min/1.732 versus −1.5(1.5) mL/min/1.732 (p = 0.116). Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at month 12 was more frequent under everolimus versus CNI overall (9.7% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.014) and versus tacrolimus-treated patients (2.6%, p < 0.001) but similar to cyclosporine-treated patients (8.8%, p = 0.755).

2-s2.0-85010723343,"In this paper we compare several types of economic dependency ratios for a selection of European countries. These dependency ratios take into account not only the demographic structure of the population, but also the differences in age-specific economic behaviour such as labour market activity, income and consumption as well as age-specific public transfers. In selected simulations where we combine patterns of age-specific economic behaviour and transfers with population projections, we show that in all countries population ageing would lead to a pronounced increase in dependency ratios if present age-specific patterns were not to change. Our analysis of cross-country differences in economic dependency demonstrates that these differences are driven by both differences in age-specific economic behaviour and in the age composition of the populations. The choice of which dependency ratio to use in a specific policy context is determined by the nature of the question to be answered. The comparison of our various dependency ratios across countries gives insights into which strategies might be effective in mitigating the expected increase in economic dependency due to demographic change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
2-s2.0-84992744410,"Background: There is a paucity of data regarding the safety and efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J). We evaluated adverse events related to PEG-J and determined the clinical impact of PEG-J in those with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Methods: This cohort study included all patients who underwent PEG-J placement in a tertiary-care academic medical center between 2010 and 2012. Main outcome measurements were (1) short- and long-term complications related to PEG-J and (2) changes in weight and hospitalizations during the 12-month period before and after PEG-J in the CP subgroup. Results: Of 102 patients undergoing PEG-J placement, the overall technical success rate was 97 %. During a median follow-up period of 22 months (1–46 months, n = 90), at least one tube malfunction occurred in 52/90 (58 %; 177 episodes) after a median of 53 days (3–350 days), requiring a median of two tube replacements. Short-term (<30 days) tube malfunction occurred in 28/90 (31 %) and delayed in 24/90 (27 %); these included dislodgement (29 %), clogging (26 %) and kinking (14 %). In the CP subgroup (n = 58), mean body weight (kg) (70 vs. 71, p = 0.06) and body mass index (kg/m2, 26 vs. 27, p = 0.05) increased post-PEG-J. Mean number of hospitalizations (5 vs. 2, p < 0.0001) and inpatient days per 12 months (22 vs. 12, p = 0.005) decreased. Conclusions: While we observed no major complications related to PEG-J, half of patients had at least one episode of tube malfunction. In the CP subgroup, jejunal feeding via PEG-J significantly reduced the number of hospitalizations and inpatients days, while improving nutritional parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85013127716,"Four types of swab (cotton, gauze, polyurethane foam (PU foam) and cellulose sponge) were used to recover four food-borne pathogens (Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes) from stainless steel and polyester urethane (old and new) surfaces under wet and dry surface conditions. Characteristics of swabs and swab surfaces were analyzed. The cellulose sponge swab showed the highest bacterial release efficiency, followed by the PU foam, gauze and cotton swabs. The bacterial Gram type affected the efficiency of bacterial recovery on dry surfaces, but the surface type had no apparent effect on the swab efficiency. Swabbing on wet surfaces using PU foam or cellulose sponge yielded a higher efficiency than with gauze or cotton swabs. Swabbing on dry surfaces with cellulose sponge and cotton swabs showed the highest and lowest swab efficiency, respectively. Swabbing on a dry surface decreased the efficiency of all swab types to 30%. For recovery from bacterial biofilms, the swab efficiency was 40% lower than those of wet surfaces. The cellulose sponge and PU foam swabs had a higher percentage recovery of biofilm than gauze and cotton swabs. Thus, the swab type and surface condition can affect the swab efficiency, and choosing the appropriate type of swab for the surface condition will increase the swab efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85006943911,"The embedding of silver nanoparticle (nAg)-containing calcium alginate (CaAlg) beads in gelatin scaffolds was aimed to reduce the burst release and prolong the release of silver (Ag+) ions for a long period of time. The reduced sizes of the nAg-containing CaAlg beads were prepared by an emulsification/external gelation method. The diameter of these beads was ~2 µm. The nAg-containing CaAlg beads were then embedded into gelatin scaffolds by a freeze-drying method for evaluating the potential of these scaffolds as wound dressings. The compressive modulus of these scaffolds embedded with nAg-containing CaAlg beads ranged between 7 and 9 kPa. For release study, the cumulative released amounts of Ag+ ions from the nAg-containing CaAlg beads embedded in gelatin scaffolds were lower than those from the nAg-containing CaAlg beads. Moreover, the nAg-containing CaAlg beads embedded in gelatin scaffolds had great antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. Thus, these scaffolds had potential for sustaining the release and use in wound care applications, especially chronic wound. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2-s2.0-85021666533,"Background: This study was performed to evaluate the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Vitamin E on oxidative stress in the plasma, synovial fluid, and synovial tissue of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Seventy-two patients with late-stage knee osteoarthritis scheduled for total knee arthroplasty were randomized to take oral placebo (Group A) or 400 IU of Vitamin E (Group B) once a day for 2 months before undergoing surgery. The blood levels of endpoints indicating oxidative stress or antioxidant capacity, Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (WOMAC), and adverse effects were compared before and after the intervention between the two groups. At surgery, these redox endpoints and histological findings were compared between the synovial fluid and synovial tissue. Results: In blood samples, the pre-intervention of oxidative stress and antioxidative capacity were not different between Group A and Group B. In post-intervention blood samples, the Malondialdehyde (Group A 1.34 ± 0.10, Group B 1.00 ± 0.09, p < 0.02), Alpha tocopherol (Group A 15.92 ± 1.08, Group B 24.65 ± 1.47, p < 0.01) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (Group A 4.22 ± 0.10, Group B 5.04 ± 0.10, 0 < 0.01) were significantly different between Group A and Group B. In synovial fluid samples, the Malondialdehyde (Group A 1.42 ± 0.12, Group B 1.06 ± 1.08, p 0.01), Alphatocopherol (Group A 4.51, Group B 7.03, p < 0.01), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (Group A, 1.89 ± 0.06, Group B 2.19 ± 0.10) were significantly different between Group A and Group B. The pre-intervention WOMAC score and KSS score were not different between Group A and Group B. The post-intervention WOMAC score was significantly improved in all categories in Group B (Pain: Group A 27.26 ± 0.89, Group B 19.19 ± 1.43, p < 0.01; Stiffness: Group A 8.23 ± 0.79, Group B 5.45 ± 0.73, p 0.01; Function: Group A 94.77 ± 4.22, Group B 72.74 ± 6.55, p < 0.01). The post-intervention KSS score was significantly improved in all categories in Group B (Clinical: Group A 25.31 ± 14.33, Group B 33.52 ± 16.96, p < 0.01; Functional: Group A 41.43 ± 16.11, Group B 51.61 ± 19.60, p 0.02). Significantly fewer synovial tissue cells were stained with nitrotyrosine and hematoxylin-eosin in Group B than in Group A. There were no differences in adverse effects or surgical complications between the groups. Conclusion: Vitamin E is an effective antioxidant that can improve clinical symptoms and reduce oxidative stress conditions in patients with late-stage knee osteoarthritis.

2-s2.0-85012909571,"Two (continuous) random variables X and Y are implicitly dependent if there exist Borel functions α and β such that α∘X=β∘Y almost surely. The copulas of such random variables are exactly the copulas that are factorizable as the ∗-product of a left invertible copula and a right invertible copula. Consequently, every implicit dependence copula assigns full mass to the graph of f(x)=g(y) for some measure-preserving functions f and g but the converse is not true in general. We obtain characterizations of a copula C assigning full mass to the graph of f(x)=g(y) in terms of a partial factorizability of its Markov operator TC and in terms of the non-atomicity of two newly defined associated σ-algebras σC and σC∗, in which case C is called non-atomic. As an application, we give a broad sufficient condition under which a copula with fractal support has an implicit dependence support. Under certain extra conditions, we explicitly compute the left invertible and right invertible factors of the copula with fractal support. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85013093636,"Background: In rectal cancer surgery, proximal ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) with radical lymphadenectomy is the accepted standard of care.1 Our purpose is to describe three different standardized technical approaches for the management of the IMA during D3 lymphadenectomy.2 Methods: Operative videos of three robotic D3 lymphadenectomy procedures for rectal cancer were reviewed and annotated with schematic anatomical descriptions for clarification. Results: There are three methods for the management of the IMA during D3 lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer. Standard high ligation is technically the simplest to perform and provides excellent mesenteric length but relies solely on marginal vessel blood supply from the middle colic artery.3 Low ligation with ascending left colic artery preservation is more complex technically but affords excellent vascular supply due to preservation of IMA blood flow, while potentially limiting mesenteric length.4 The central vascular sparing technique is the most complex to perform but allows excellent mesenteric length due to the presence of two separate points of mesenteric division, while also potentially improving blood supply due to decreased vascular resistance and improved collateralization. With each technique, central ligation of the inferior mesenteric vein above the splenic flexure tributary is performed to release the mesentery. Conclusions: The three methods to manage the IMA vary in their technical complexity, preservation of colonic conduit blood supply, and provision of mesenteric length, with associated advantages and disadvantages. The choice of technique is dependent on anatomical and oncological considerations. © 2017, Society of Surgical Oncology."

The study aim was to explore the influence of socioeconomic factors on activities of daily living and quality of life of Thai seniors. Design and methods: Using randomised cluster sampling, one province was sampled from each of the Central, North, Northeast and South regions, then one subdistrict sampled in each province, and a household survey used to identify the sample of 1678 seniors aged 60 years and over. The Mann-Whitney U-test and binary logistic regression were used to compare and determine the association of socioeconomic variables on quality of life and activities of daily living. Results: The findings showed that sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were significantly related to functional capacity of daily living. Education levels were strongly associated with daily life activities, with 3.55 adjusted ORs for respondents with secondary school education. Gender was important, with females comprising 61% of dependent respondents but only 47% of independent respondents. Seniors with low incomes were more likely to be anxious in the past, present and future and less likely to accept death in the late stage, with 1.40 Adjusted ORs (95%CI: 1.02-1.92), and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.53-0.98), respectively. However, they were more likely to engage in social activities. Conclusions: While socioeconomic factors strongly indicated the functional capacity to live independently, a good quality of life also required other factors leading to happiness and life satisfaction. © R.

2-s2.0-85011968954,"Nanocellulose is a natural polymer containing abundant hydroxyl groups which can create the network of hydrogen bonds between intra- and inter-molecular cellulose chains and also react with many other functional molecules. These interactions are helpful to film formation and surface modification. Silylation is a well-known modification, in which silane is substituted into a molecule for the improvement of desired properties such as hydrophobization, antimicrobial activity, and compatibilization with plastics for composites. However, to our knowledge, there is no study regarding the silane-modified nanocellulose for adhesion improvement even though nanocellulose film has potential for applications as a protective coating, insulation coating, biomedical coating, etc. Therefore, in this work nanofibrillated cellulose in aqueous suspension - obtained from hemp stubs - was used as a coating material. Various silanes containing dissimilar functional groups were employed in order to improve poor adhesion of nanocellulose films on glass and aluminum substrates and also enhance their physical and mechanical properties. It was found that silane containing an amino group provided the optimum increase of adhesion performance when compared with epoxy and methacryloxy groups, in which higher ratio of amino silane tended to give better adhesion on glass and aluminum substrates. Moreover, amino silane was capable of improving surface hardness, elastic modulus, and scratch resistance of coating film and also providing the satisfied results of optical properties and hydrophobic characteristic to nanocellulose film. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84989831761,"Aeration is an important factor in aquaculture systems because it is a vital condition for all organisms that live in water and respire aerobically. Generally, mechanical surface aerators are widely used in Thailand due to their advantage for increasing dissolved oxygen (DO) and for their horizontal mixing of aquaculture ponds with large surface areas. However, these systems still have some drawbacks, primarily the low oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) and energy. Regarding this issue, alternative aeration systems should be studied and applied. Therefore, this research aims to study the aeration mechanism obtained by the diffused-air aeration combined with a liquid-film-forming apparatus (LFFA). The effect of gas flow rates, types, and patterns of aerator installation were investigated in an aquaculture pond of 10 m × 10 m × 1.5 m. The analytical parameters were volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa), OTE, and aeration efficiency (AE). From the results, the ‘4-D’ with partitions was proposed as the suitable pattern for the LFFA installation. The advantage could be obtained from high energy performance with 1.2 kg/kW h of AE. Then, the operation conditions can be applied as a design guideline for this alternative aeration system in the aquaculture ponds. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85022058289,"In this paper, we present numerous small cell base station, i.e. femtocell base station (FCBS), with control-/user-plane coupled and separation architectures based on the number of transceivers and operating frequency bands to serve control-/user-plane traffic. A single transceiver enabled FCBS can operate at either a co-channel microwave of the overlaid macrocell or a millimeter wave band. For multiple transceivers, dual transceivers are considered operating at both bands. FCBSs are deployed in a number of buildings with each floor modeled as 5×5 square-grid apartments. The co-channel interference with FCBSs is avoided using enhanced intercell interference coordination techniques. We propose a static frequency reuse approach and develop an algorithm by avoiding adjacent channel interferences from reusing frequencies in FCBSs. We also develop a resource scheduling algorithm for FCBSs with CUCA and CUSA to evaluate system level performances with a multi-tier network. It is found that a single transceiver co-channel microwave enabled FCBS with CUCA provides the worse, whereas a single or dual transceivers millimeter wave enabled FCBS with CUSA provides the best overall system capacity and FCBSs’ energy efficiency performances. Besides, we show the outperformances of the proposed resource reuse approach over an existing approach in literature in terms of system capacity and fairness among FCBSs with CUCA. Finally, we point out the applicability of a multi-band enabled FCBS and several features and issues of FCBSs with CUCA and CUSA. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85022178153,"Background and Aims. The inhibitory pathways that play a role in spinal modulation include local interneurons and descending control. Clinical data regarding the role of these pathways in acute pain is lacking. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of noradrenaline, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine in parturients with labor pain compared to those without labor pain. Methods. One hundred term uncomplicated pregnant women receiving spinal anesthesia for cesarean section were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. CSF noradrenaline, serotonin, GABA, and glycine levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Labor pain score was assessed by numerical rating scale. Results. Median CSF serotonin concentration in parturients with labor pain was significantly lower than in those without pain (p<0.001). Median CSF glycine level in the labor pain group was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.001). There were no significant differences in median CSF level of noradrenaline or GABA between parturients with and without labor pain. Subsequent analysis showed labor pain scores to be negatively correlated with CSF serotonin (r=-0.217, p=0.04) but positively correlated with CSF glycine (r=0.415, p<0.001). Conclusion. CSF serotonin and glycine were significantly correlated with labor pain scores. These findings suggest that the serotonergic and glycinergic systems may play a role in spinal modulation of visceral pain. © 2017 Pornpan Chalermkitpanit et al."

The properties of biochar prepared from Acacia wood and coconut shell were investigated by different pyrolysis conditions in order to identify the suitable initial biomass of biochar applied for sandy soil amendment. The slow pyrolysis was applied for preparing biochar under different conditions. The temperature was varied from 300, 400 and 500 °C meanwhile the pyrolysis times were varied to 1, 2 and 3 hours. The parameters indicating biochar property are SA, APD, elemental contents of C, H, O and N, pH, CEC, and WHC. The properties of Acacia biochar and coconut shell biochar were compared using paired T-test at 95% confident interval to analyze the significant difference. The results indicated that the types of the initial biomass and the pyrolysis conditions have an impact on the properties of biochar for both physical and chemical. The suitable temperature was 500 °C for 2 hours. The different types of biomass are significantly effect on the SA, C and O contents, pH, CEC and WHC of the prepared biochar (P<0.05). Properties of Acacia wood biochar indicate that it is more suitable than coconut shell biochar to be applied as sandy soil amendment due to its higher SA, higher CEC, and neutral pH.

The model includes a set of partial differential equations of the continuity, mass transfer and energy balance equations. The performance of the OCM using different catalysts was assessed in terms of CH4 conversion, C2 selectivity and C2 yield with respect to key operating parameters, such as feed temperature (973-1173 K), CH4/O2 ratio (3.4–7.5) and gas hour space velocity (GHSV) (18000-30000 h-1). The simulation results indicated that the Na-W-Mn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits the best performance among all of the catalysts. The C2 yield were 20.16% and 20.00% for non-isothermal and isothermal modes respectively which the OCM reactor is operated at a CH4/O2 ratio of 3.4, a feed temperature of 1073 K and a GHSV of 9720 h-1. An increase in the operating temperature increases the CH4 conversion but decreases the C2 selectivity.

Both 3-(N,N-dimethyloctylammonio)propanesulfonate and 3-(N,N-dimethyldodecylammonio)propanesulfonate-stabilized microemulsions containing two short chain length oils, ethyl butyrate and ethyl caprylate, while only 3-(N,N-dimethyldodecylammonio)propanesulfonate formed microemulsions incorporating the longer chain length oils, ethyl palmitate and ethyl oleate, albeit to a very much reduced extent. Significantly the microemulsions containing the short chain length oils, ethyl butyrate and ethyl caprylate solubilised more testosterone propionate than the corresponding micelles. However, an inverse correlation existed between testosterone propionate solubility in the bulk oil and solubilisation in the microemulsions, in that ethyl caprylate containing microemulsions solubilised more testosterone propionate than those containing an equivalent amount of ethyl butyrate, despite the drug being more soluble in ethyl butyrate. These results suggest that drug solubility in bulk oil is a poor indicator of drug solubility in microemulsions containing that oil, and whether or not the addition of oil improves drug solubility is dependent upon on how it is incorporated within the microemulsion. The longer the chain length of the oil, the more likely the oil is to form a core in the microemulsion droplet, resulting in an additional locus of drug solubilisation and the possibility of an enhanced solubilisation capacity. © 2017"

To do this, the NF and RO membranes NF-1 and RO-1 were used, and the isoelectric points of the NF-1 and RO-1 membranes were determined to be at approximate pH of 6.0. The NF-1 membrane’s CBZ rejections at solution pH values of 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 were in a slight range of 92-93%. Additionally, SMX rejections by the NF-1 membrane at the same three solution pH values were 87%, 91%, and 94%, respectively. Meanwhile, the RO-1 membrane’s CBZ rejections at those solution pH values were also in a narrow range of 92-94%, and its SMX rejections were 94%, 97%, and 98%, respectively. Solution pH was found to have no effect on CBZ rejection but it did affect SMX rejection. Mixed pharmaceuticals showed insignificant change in rejections compared with those of single pharmaceutical. The effect of membrane fouling on SMX removal was observed. It was found that when the membranes were fouled by tannic acid (TA) in the presence and absence of calcium chloride (CaCl2), the membrane’s rejection of SMX was improved. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85021935376,"Explosives are commonly used to generate strong impulsive waves for on-land petroleum exploration. For each exploration area in Thailand, a concessionaire shall submit an environmental impact assessment report that commits minimum distances, or setback distances, between an explosive and various types of structures to a regulatory authority. However, the basis for determining the setback distances is not described and or based on surface mine blasting researches. To establish a guideline for exploration contractors in Thailand, ground vibrations were measured from ten exploration sites across the country which can be grouped into three geology conditions, namely sandy ground, clayey ground and sandy ground with rock boulders. Explosives in this study were buried and packed in boreholes at depths of 9 ~ 23 m, having weights of 1 ~ 4 kg and length-to-diameter ratios of 6 ~ 25. The measured data were used for determining the attenuation of particle velocities over distance and the frequency content of vibrations. The geometric damping was found to be the main cause of attenuation while the material damping was negligible. The attenuation in sandy ground with rock boulders was found to be stronger than sandy ground and clayey ground. Since the dominant frequencies of vibration in each ground type varied over wide range, the frequencies at the 2.5th percentile were used for the conservative sake in the vibration assessment according to DIN 4150. Based the proposed formula, the setback distances between residential buildings and a 2-kg explosive are 53, 149 and 221 m for sandy with rock boulders, sandy and clayey grounds, respectively. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

Five top-hit compounds (the ZINC compounds 49888724, 49054741, 49777239, 49793673, and 49780355) were then studied by the SMD simulations based on the hypothesis that a high rupture force relates to a high binding efficiency. The results demonstrated that the ZINC compound 49888724 had a greater maximum rupture force, reflecting a good binding strength and inhibitory potency than known inhibitors and the rest four ZINC compounds. Therefore, our finding indicated that the ZINC compound 49888724 is a potential candidate to be a novel NS5B inhibitor for further design. Besides, the van der Waals interaction could be considered as the main contribution for stabilizing the NS5B-ligand complex. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85021281194,"Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) conversions of sugarcane bagasse (pretreated and untreated, or ""raw"") over HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst were conducted in a fluidized-bed reactor to compare the hydrocarbons yields and selectivities of pretreated and raw biomass materials in order to determine the effect of inorganic matter on the aromatics and olefins yields. The effects of reaction temperature and sweeping gas flow rate (SGFR) on aromatics and olefins yields and selectivities were studied. The results showed that a maximum aromatics yield of 12.41% carbon was obtained during CFP of pretreated sugarcane bagasse at an optimum gas flow rate of 2.5 L min-1 and temperature of 500°C. The highest olefins yield was 10.89% carbon under the same CFP conditions. Benzene and ethylene were the dominant compounds in the aromatics and olefins, respectively. The highest selectivities to benzene and ethylene were 46.44% and 45.45% carbon, respectively. Slightly lower aromatics and olefins yields of 11.77% and 9.9%, respectively, were obtained from CFP of untreated biomass. In the final step, the yields of aromatics and olefins for the raw and treated sugarcane bagasse were compared, and in addition the yields and selectivities at optimum conditions were compared. The results suggest that inorganic matter has an inhibiting effect on hydrocarbons production and also causes catalyst deactivation by blocking the catalyst pores. It is evident that removal of inorganic matter would increase both liquid and hydrocarbons yields during CFP over HZSM-5. Hydrocarbons yields and selectivities were found to depend not only on temperature and SGFR but also on the severity of the treatment process. © 2017 American Chemical Society."

2-s2.0-85020446982,"Endolysosomal processing has a critical influence on immunogenicity as well as immune polarization of protein antigens. In industrialized countries, allergies affect around 25% of the population. For the rational design of protein-based allergy therapeutics for immunotherapy, a good knowledge of T cell-reactive regions on allergens is required. Thus, we sought to analyze endolysosomal degradation patterns of inhalant allergens. Four major allergens from ragweed, birch, as well as house dust mites were produced as recombinant proteins. Endolysosomal proteases were purified by differential centrifugation from dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and combined with allergens for proteolytic processing. Thereafter, endolysosomal proteolysis was monitored by protein gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We found that the overall proteolytic activity of specific endolysosomal fractions differed substantially, whereas the degradation patterns of the four model allergens obtained with the different proteases were extremely similar. Moreover, previously identified T cell epitopes were assigned to endolysosomal peptides and indeed showed a good overlap with known T cell epitopes for all four candidate allergens. Thus, we propose that the degradome assay can be used as a predictor to determine antigenic peptides as potential T cell epitopes, which will help in the rational design of protein-based allergy vaccine candidates. © 2017 by the authors.

2-s2.0-85020279374,"Background: Bangladesh has experienced a sevenfold increase in its contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) in less than forty years from 8% in 1975 to 62% in 2014. However, despite this progress, almost one-third of pregnancies are still unintended which may be attributed to unmet need for family planning and discontinuation and switching of methods after initiation of their use. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review on contraceptive use among married women of reproductive age (MWRA) in Bangladesh. A total of 263 articles were identified through database search and after final screening ten articles were included in this synthesis. Results: Findings showed that method discontinuation and switching, method failure, and method mix may offset achievements in the CPR. Most of the women know of at least one contraceptive method. Oral pill is the most widely used (27%) method, followed by injectables (12.4%), condoms (6.4%), female sterilization (4.6%), male sterilization (1.2%), implants (1.7%), and IUDs (0.6%). There has been a decline in the use of long acting and permanent methods over the last two decades. Within 12 months of initiation, the rate of method discontinuation particularly the short-acting methods remain high at 36%. It is important to recognize the trends as married Bangladeshi women, on average, wanted 1.6 children, but the rate of actual children was 2.3. Conclusions: A renewed commitment from government bodies and independent organizations is needed to implement and monitor family planning strategies in order to ensure the adherence to and provision of the most appropriate contraceptive method for couples. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85017798668,"A search is presented for narrow resonances decaying to dijet final states in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb−1. The dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no significant evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 7.4 TeV, scalar diquarks below 6.9 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 5.5 TeV, excited quarks below 5.4 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.0 TeV, W′ bosons below 2.7 TeV, Z′ bosons below 2.1 TeV and between 2.3 and 2.6 TeV, and RS gravitons below 1.9 TeV. These extend previous limits in the dijet channel. Vector and axial-vector mediators in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter are excluded below 2.0 TeV. The first limits in the dijet channel on dark matter mediators are presented as functions of dark matter mass and are compared to the exclusions of dark matter in direct detection experiments. © 2017 The Author"
2-s2.0-85067933909,"This paper develops a distribution circuit multi-time-scale simulation tool for applications in wind turbine and photovoltaic (PV) integration analysis. The proposed simulation tool developed in MATLAB™ includes several distribution circuit components, such as voltage sources, distribution lines, transformers, loads, capacitor banks, wind turbines and PVs. Each equipment consists of three models for simulations in three different time scales, i.e., steady-state, electromechanical transient and electromagnetic transient models. Therefore, the proposed tool is able to perform a long-term simulation involving power system phenomena spreading across time scales. The test circuits employed to perform multi-time-scale simulation in this paper are modified from the IEEE four-node test feeder. The simulation scenarios include wind speed and solar irradiance ramp up and down; a capacitor bank is energized and de-energized; and a single-line-to-ground fault occurs and clears itself. The simulation results show that the proposed tool is capable of evaluating power system phenomena spread across time scales. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85066010054,"This paper presents a planning framework for integrating energy storage (ES) systems into the distribution system. An ES system is deployed to simultaneously provide multiple benefits, also known as stacked-benefits, for the feeder. The primary and secondary application scenarios for the feeder are identified. The proposed ES deployment approach includes the following steps: (1) size the ES system for primary application; (2) identify optimal ES locations based on both primary and secondary application scenarios; (3) calculate the ES accommodation capacity for each potential location; and (4) develop control methods for ES units and conduct grid impact analysis to demonstrate ES applications. For the selected feeder, the primary application for ES deployment is to provide the N-1 contingency requirement. During normal operating conditions, ES is programmed for multiple secondary applications: voltage management and ancillary services by frequency regulation. A probabilistic approach is presented to obtain the optimal ES size for providing the N-1 contingency requirement. Optimal ES locations are obtained based on secondary application scenarios. Real and reactive power control methods are developed to demonstrate the viability of deploying an ES system for simultaneously providing multiple applications. The simulation results show that ES can successfully provide the stacked-benefits for the distribution circuit. The proposed framework is generic and can be employed for the ES integration analysis of any feeder, with different sets of primary and secondary applications. © 2017 by the authors.

Phuket has consistently been top ranked for coastal tourism, with 12.5 million tourists generating USD 9.04 million (34.62 THB=1USD as of April 30, 2017) revenue in 2015. In order to study the relationship between demographic variables and satisfaction, a survey was given to 1,221 visitors in the departure hall of Phuket International Airport. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to examine the interaction between tourist sociodemographics and tourist satisfaction. The findings showed nationality had the most significant influence on the overall tourist satisfaction with Maikhao beach, Surin-Bangtao beach, and Kata-Karon beach. Education was a significant factor concerning Patong-Kamala beach, and income was directly correlated with tourist satisfaction in the case of Kata-Karon beach. Additional analysis showed that being a first time visitor or repeat visitor, and number of nights spent had significant effects on tourist satisfaction. The findings reveal considerable differences in satisfaction levels between tourists’ profiles and destinations that will be essential in helping tourism decision makers, local government and businesses to comprehensively manage and market to specific tourist segments. © 2017.

2-s2.0-85029042071,"The present work aimed to develop the wastewater treatment process for the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Sedimentation, coagulation, and filtration were applied for treating suspended solid (SS) and nitrate in wastewater from a tilapia pond. The combination in series of sedimentation and dual-media filtration of sand–anthracite was found as the appropriate process for SS separation. The size of media and suspended particles can affect the filtration mechanism as well as filtration time and removal efficiency. SS removal efficiency of 92% with an average particle size of 28 µm in the effluent was obtained from the optimal experimental conditions of sedimentation and dual-media filtration. An overflow rate of 4.1 m/h was obtained as the optimal level, followed with an effective size of sand and anthracite of 0.80 and 2.00 mm, respectively. Moreover, up to 90% of nitrate was successfully removed via bio-filtration (with biofilm) after applying a C:N ratio of 2.1:1 and a filtration rate of 0.20 m/h. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

2-s2.0-85029445324,"Occurrence of azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (ARAF) in the environment is an emerging problem worldwide, likely impacting on patient treatment. Several resistance mutations are thought to have initially arisen through triazole-based fungicide use in agriculture and subsequently being propagated in a similar manner. Here we investigated the prevalence of ARAF in the environment of Thailand and characterized their susceptibility profiles toward clinically used azole compounds along with underlying resistance mutations. Three hundred and eight soil samples were collected and analyzed, out of which 3.25% (n = 10) were positive for ARAF. All isolates obtained were resistant to itraconazole (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml), two showed additional increased MIC values toward posaconazole (MIC = 0.5 μg/ml), and one other toward voriconazole (MIC = 2 μg/ml). Sequencing of the respective cyp51A genes revealed that eight of the isolates carried the TR34/L98H allele and those two with elevated MIC values to posaconazole the G54R substitution. Although a clear correlation between the use of triazole-based fungicides and isolation of ARAF strains from agricultural lands could not be established for Thailand, but this study clearly demonstrates the spread of globally observed ARAF strains to the environment of South East Asia. © The Author 2016.

2-s2.0-85028259570,"A method for the determination of Ni(II) using ion-transfer to a hydroxide medium has been developed by the sequential injection-electrochemical analysis (SIECA), a combination between an automated flow-based analysis and electrochemical techniques with a homemade screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). A sample/standard solution was introduced into an electrochemical flow cell where the Ni(II) in the solution was electrochemically reduced and accumulated on the SPCE. The accumulated Ni was then oxidized to Ni(II) in a hydroxide medium, which led to the formation of nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) and nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) on the SPCE. The electrochemical response associated with Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH was subsequently determined by square-wave voltammetry to account for Ni(II). Under optimal conditions, the proposed method provides a low detection limit of 0.02 mg mL−1. This method was further applied to determine the Ni(II) content of standard-spiked mineral water samples with satisfactory results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The propagation of pathogenic bacteria within the mouth can cause periodontitis. Objectives: In this study, bacterial classifications were performed based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in order to identify potential bacterial species associated with a periodontal disease in Thai patients. Methods: Dental plaques were collected from healthy controls (n = 5; mean age = 48.4 ± 4.5 years) and patients with a chronic periodontitis (n =5; mean age = 47.4 ± 10.1 years). Total DNA was extracted and then amplified by specific primers within a V3/V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. The purified DNA from samples within the same group were pooled together and used to construct DNA libraries with different indexes. High-throughput sequencing with paired-end (250×2) was carried out on a MiSeq platform. Pass-filter sequencing reads (Q≥ 30) were used for bacterial classification. Results: The comparative analysis of healthy controls and patients with a chronic periodontitis revealed that Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were significantly associated with a periodontal disease. Other bacteria such as Treponema denticola, T. medium, Tannerella forsythia, P. endodontalis and Filifactor alocis might be potentially associated with the periodontal disease in Thai patients. Conclusions: Several potential bacteria that might be associated with periodontal disease in Thai patients were identified.

2-s2.0-85026730639,"This study evaluates the effectiveness of a newly developed retrofitting scheme for masonry -infilled non-ductile RC frames experimentally and by numerical simulation. The technique focuses on modifying the load path and yield mechanism of the infilled frame to enhance the ductility. A vertical gap between the column and the infill panel was strategically introduced so that no shear force is directly transferred to the column. Steel brackets and small vertical steel members were then provided to transfer the interactive forces between the RC frame and the masonry panel. Wire meshes and high-strength mortar were provided in areas with high stress concentration and in the panel to further reduce damage. Cyclic load tests on a large-scale specimen of a single-bay, single-story, masonry-infilled RC frame were carried out. Based on those tests, the retrofitting scheme provided significant improvement, especially in terms of ductility enhancement. All retrofitted specimens clearly exhibited much better performances than those stipulated in building standards for masonry-infilled structures. A macro-scale computer model based on a diagonal-strut concept was also developed for predicting the global behavior of the retrofitted masonry-infilled frames. This proposed model was effectively used to evaluate the global responses of the test specimens with acceptable accuracy, especially in terms of strength, stiffness and damage condition. © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd."

On the basis of morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, it was classified among the members of the genus Nonomuraea. It produced tightly closed spiral spore chains on aerial mycelium as well as forming a pseudosporangium. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, ribose, madurose and mannose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, unknown ninhydrin-positive phosphoglycolipids and unknown glycolipid. Menaquiones were MK-9(H4), MK-9(H0), MK-9(H2), MK-10(H4) and MK-9(H6). Predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0, C17 : 010-methyl, C16 : 0, C17 : 1ω8c, C16 : 02-OH and iso-C15 : 0.

2-s2.0-85021976876,"In April 2016, the Kumamoto earthquakes in Japan killed 50 people and injured more than 3,000. Because Japan is a primary tourist destination for Thai citizens, due in part to the current visa relaxation policy, many Thai people were visiting Japan when these earthquakes occurred. However, while a variety of public information related to the imminent danger and disaster response was broadcast and published, foreigners sometimes had little access to or understanding of local notices or instructions because of language barriers. This study researches the evacuation process for Thai citizens – including tourists, students, and residents from Thailand – in the disaster-affected areas during the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. Through prompt collaboration among the relevant organizations, particularly the Royal Thai Embassy in Tokyo, the evacuation of Thai citizens was successfully completed within a few days. Moreover, some other foreigners were also assisted by the Thai embassy. This paper presents an overview of the evacuation process, including the critical role of information and communication technology (ICT) in disseminating information, transmitting rescue requests, and providing emergency communications. The lessons learned from these efforts can be applied in future natural disasters, especially for foreign organizations working in similar capacities overseas. In addition, this study suggests disaster preparedness and response guidelines for tourists when traveling overseas. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85021831398,"This work studies interpolation techniques that can be employed on off-line robust constrained model predictive control (MPC) for a discrete time-varying system with polytopic parametric uncertainty. A sequence of feedback gains is determined by solving off-line a series of optimal control optimization problems. A sequence of nested corresponding polyhedral invariant set is then constructed. At each sampling time, the smallest invariant set containing the current state is determined. If the current invariant set is the innermost set, the pre-computed gain associated with the innermost set is applied. If otherwise, a feedback gain is variable and determined by a linear interpolation of the pre-computed gains. Two interpolation algorithms are investigated. The proposed algorithms are illustrated with case studies of a two-tank system and a four-tank system. The simulation results showed that the proposed interpolation techniques can improve control performance of off-line robust MPC while on-line computation is still tractable. © The authors 2015.

2-s2.0-85021788163,"Contaminated poultry meat is regarded as the main source of human campylobacteriosis. During September 2014 and February 2015, breeder flocks, hatcheries, and broiler farms from two chicken production chains were investigated chronologically. Five commercial breeder flocks (Breeder Flocks 1-5), two hatcheries (Hatcheries A and B), and five broiler flocks (Broiler Flocks 1-5) were sampled in this study. Campylobacter colonization of both breeder and broiler flocks was determined from cloacal swabs and environmental samples (pan feeders, footwear, darkling beetles, flies, feed, and water). The eggs from the breeder flocks were followed to hatcheries. At the hatcheries, early embryonic deaths, egg trays, eggshells, hatchers, and water were investigated. Cloacal swabs were taken from broilers at Days 1, 14, and 28 (all broiler flocks), and either 35 (Broiler Flocks 1 and 2) or 43 (Broiler Flocks 3-5). Thirty-six Campylobacter jejuni and 94 Campylobacter coli isolates collected through two broiler production chains were tested by twofold agar dilution for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Most Campylobacter isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), defined as being resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes (C. jejuni: 100%; C. coli: 98.9%), and exhibited high resistance to enrofloxacin (C. jejuni: 100%; C. coli: 98.9%). The vast majority of C. coli were resistant to tetracycline (97.9%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (81.9%), and doxycycline (79.8%), but only 55.6%, 36.1%, and 50% of C. jejuni isolates revealed resistance to these antimicrobial agents, respectively. A selected subset of 24 C. jejuni and 24 C. coli were characterized for their mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region of the DNA gyrase subunit A gene by nucleotide sequence analysis. The Thr-86-Ile substitution (ACA-ATA in C. jejuni or ACT-ATT in C. coli) was found in all isolates. Moreover, a total of 130 Campylobacter isolates were typed with the use of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the flagellin A gene (flaA-RFLP) to determine their genetic relationships. Ten distinct clusters were recognized by flaA-RFLP typing. The results showed that horizontal transmission was the major route of Campylobacter transmission in this study. In conclusion, the emergence of MDR and high resistance rates to several antimicrobials are major concerns identified in this study. The prudent use of these agents and active surveillance of resistance at the farm level are essential steps to reduce the public health risks identified in this work."
2-s2.0-85021949876,"This study is focusing to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall using water stable isotope technique as well as the surface water-groundwater interactions for the aquifer systems in the Upper Chao Phraya river basin systems. Local precipitation, surface water, and groundwater along the main river courses and their tributaries are directly samples. Massive precipitation isotopic composition database from existing IAEA monitoring network (GNIB) along with local Bangkok precipitation isotopic signature are compared with precipitation from Chiang Mai province to better identify the rainfall isotopic compositions. In addition to the isotopic differentiation of precipitation in the area, its impacts on isotopic characteristics of surface water and groundwater are additionally explored. LMWLs (Local Meteoric Water Line) for local rainfall in Bangkok and Chiang Mai are generated with some seasonal variation due to rain out effect. Surface water is influenced by evaporation at some degree, revealing that rainfall may not be the primary source of surface water. Yom river's isotope values are far more D and 180-enriched compared to Ping's and Nan's, suggesting the mixing of groundwater with river water and/or the source of surface water may come from dry-period precipitation. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in groundwater fall on an evaporation line, and are thus indicative of the effects of high evaporation rates through the top surficial material. The isotopic similarity with the more depleted 6D and 5180 of groundwater samples suggests the potential mixing of groundwater with river water by different mixing processes (54% from river water and 46% from rainfall). The results show correlations in the isotope signature of shallow (< 50 m deep) and deeper aquifer (> 50 m deep) which may be associated with hydraulic connection and/or similar hydrogeological conditions, d-excess stable isotope analyses are beneficial to identify the relative contributions of the wet and dry seasonal sources to the groundwater recharge. The results indicate that groundwater sources are composed of - 71.4% wet seasonal sources and -28.6% dry seasonal sources."
2-s2.0-85021870304,"There has been growing emphasis on quality measures and process analysis techniques that may be implemented in the daily practice of aviation refuelling to improve the overall quality of safety care. The quality assessment and process controls are most effective when used to determine the level of execution proficiency against the standard of aviation fuel quality control and handling. In this article, we have developed the quality assessment tools, control charts and new key indicator to prioritize the quality improvement that should be actionable and specific to guide process improvement efforts successively. Changing from a regular visual check to an automatic visual inspection tool, as well as from a pass/fail criteria to a satisfaction scale from 1 to 10 in the control, produces systematic data. Control charts are an effective way to separate a change in the process, so the user can focus on issues that are more likely to improve quality and safety. Our proposed quality assessment tools, process control and quality improvement prioritization were used to provide continuous feedback on the aviation refuelling service's capability to exceed the standards. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85021405061,"A measurement of electroweak-induced production of Wγ and two jets is performed, where the W boson decays leptonically. The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1 collected by the CMS experiment in s=8 TeV proton-proton collisions produced at the LHC. Candidate events are selected with exactly one muon or electron, missing transverse momentum, one photon, and two jets with large rapidity separation. An excess over the hypothesis of the standard model without electroweak production of Wγ with two jets is observed with a significance of 2.7 standard deviations. The cross section measured in the fiducial region is 10.8 ± 4.1(stat) ± 3.4(syst) ± 0.3(lumi) fb, which is consistent with the standard model electroweak prediction. The total cross section for Wγ in association with two jets in the same fiducial region is measured to be 23.2 ± 4.3(stat) ± 1.7(syst) ± 0.6(lumi) fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction from the combination of electroweak and quantum chromodynamics-induced processes. No deviations are observed from the standard model predictions and experimental limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings fM,0−7/Λ4, fT,0−2/Λ4, and fT,5−7/Λ4 are set at 95% confidence level.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85021636485,"The abundance of Aedes mosquito species enabled widespread transmission of mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) in Southeast Asia. Periodic seroprevalence surveys are therefore necessary to assess the viral burden in the population and the effectiveness of public health interventions. Since the current seroprevalence for CHIKV and DENV in Thailand are unknown, we evaluated evidence of past infection among Thais. Eight-hundred and thirty-five serum samples obtained from individuals living in central and southern Thailand were assessed for anti-CHIKV and anti-DENV IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Overall, 26.8% (224/835) of individuals were seropositive for CHIKV, the majority of whom were also DENV-seropositive (91.1%, 204/224). Approximately half of all adults in their fifth decade of life had attained CHIKV seropositivity. Children under 15 years of age in southern Thailand were significantly more likely to be CHIKV-seropositive compared to those residing in central Thailand. In contrast, 79.2% (661/835) of Thais were DENV-seropositive, 30.9% (204/661) of whom also had antibodies to CHIKV. CHIKV/DENV dual seropositivity among Thais was 24.4% (204/835). The age-standardized seroprevalence for DENV was three times that of CHIKV (80.5% vs. 27.2%). Relatively high CHIKV seroprevalence among adults living in central Thailand revealed an under-recognized CHIKV burden in the region, while the low-to-moderate transmission intensity of DENV (seroprevalence <50% at 9 years) is expected to reduce the impact of DENV vaccination in Thailand. This most recent seroprevalence data provide serological baselines for two of the most common mosquito-borne viruses in this region. © 2017 Vongpunsawad et al.

2-s2.0-85020456674,"Cu(II)/Bi2O3 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized through a simple sol-gel route. The photocatalyst was characterized by synchrotron-based techniques including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and other techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Its photocatalytic activity was evaluated for degradation and mineralization of atrazine in aqueous solutions under different light wavelengths (visible, UVA, UVB and UVC). The toxicity of photocatalytically treated atrazine solution was comprehensively tested by nine different bioassays. Results show that Cu species on the Bi2O3 surface exists in +2 oxidation state, which is coordinated with four O atoms with an average bond length of 1.947 Å. The light wavelength was found to affect the final toxicity of atrazine solution. Irradiation of Cu(II)/Bi2O3 with visible light generally resulted in lower toxicity of atrazine solution although it led to slower degradation and mineralization of atrazine. Therefore, as far as the toxicity reduction is concerned, use of visible light for Cu(II)/Bi2O3 is preferred. Based on the present findings, proper selection of light wavelength could be a suitable option for toxicity reduction of photocatalyically treated organic contaminants in water environment. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Methods: Class V cavities prepared in extracted human molars composed of enamel, cementum and dentin surfaces were sealed using either 4-META/MMA-TBB resin with conditioning periods of 10, 30, 60 seconds with 10% citric acid and 3% ferric chloride mixed aqueous solution (10-3) or Single-Bond 2 adhesives prior to restoration with light-cured resin-composite. Specimens were either immersed in artificial saliva or 0.1 mol/L buffered lactic acid solutions at 37°C for 14 days. After immersion in 0.5% basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours, the extent of dye penetration at the margin was measured. SEM micrography was used to investigate the quality of hybridized dentin when immersed in HCl followed by NaOCl solutions. Results: After lactic acid exposure, dye penetration into the adjacent demineralized cementum/dentin was found to be significantly lower than the leakage distance under 30 and 60 seconds and Single-Bond 2 specimens. Leakage-free margins were found in 10-second conditioning period specimens for both control and after soaking in buffered lactic solution with the stable hybridized dentin after chemical challenge."
2-s2.0-85020284765,"The incorporation of photovoltaic (PV) inverters makes the management of voltage difficult for power system operators. One solution is to consider these inverter-based devices as controllable reactive power (VAr) sources and to coordinate them with other voltage regulating devices in the distribution system. This paper proposes some acceptable approximations to quickly formulate and solve a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem to periodically determine the optimal voltage coordination of a load tap changer, voltage regulators, capacitor banks, and PVs on a smart grid platform. The solution to the optimization problem is aided by an iteration-based algorithm. By using the MATLAB software to carry out the simulation and computation, the method is well verified by comparing its generated result with a trustworthy solution obtained from examining all possible coordinating combinations of voltage regulating devices and PVs in a modified IEEE 34-bus system. The effectiveness and features of the method are clearly illustrated on that test system by considering a time-varying load and PV generation.

Research into these conditions is hampered by a lack of standardization of case reporting and data collection. OBJECTIVE: To establish a standardized case report form to facilitate comparisons and maintain data quality based on an international panel of SJS/TEN experts who performed a Delphi consensus-building exercise. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The elements presented for committee scrutiny were adapted from previous case report forms and from PubMed literature searches of highly cited manuscripts pertaining to SJS/TEN. The expert opinions and experience of the members of the consensus group were included in the discussion. FINDINGS: Overall, 21 out of 29 experts who were invited to participate in the online Delphi exercise agreed to participate. Surveys at each stage were administered via an online survery software tool. For the first 2 Delphi rounds, results were analyzed using the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry method and statements that passed consensus formulated a new case report form. For the third Delphi round, the case report form was presented to the committee, who agreed that it was ""appropriate and useful"" for documenting cases of SJS/TEN, making it more reliable and valuable for future research endeavors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: With the consensus of international experts, a case report form for SJS/TEN has been created to help standardize the collection of patient information in future studies and the documentation of individual cases. © 2017 American Medical Association.

2-s2.0-85020252818,"Recently, planning and designing of smart-grid (SG) neighborhood area network (NAN) communication architecture has drawn wide attention of researchers. In order to establish an SG NAN scheme satisfying the requirement, a quality of service (QoS) metric is a critical demand. However, there are few studies on the implementation of an efficient QoS metric model. In this paper, we propose an innovative QoS metric model for SG NAN design. By exploring the natural characteristics of SG messages in many applications, we choose the reliability and latency of a message as the most important criteria and implement the QoS curve for evaluating the performance of any candidate communication scheme. In addition, we present the evaluation model for QoS metrics of multiple SG services in NAN. Compared to other existing QoS methods, our model is easy to use and helps to reduce the time and cost in the planning and designing of a NAN for SG. Simulation and analysis results indicate good agreement with our proposed QoS model. © 2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

2-s2.0-85020640329,"Fast scanning calorimetry (FSC) was employed to analyze the crystallization kinetics of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) graphene nanocomposites. The emphasis of the present study is the heterogeneous nucleation of the PBS crystals in the presence of graphene nanosheets. Graphene oxide nanosheets were first synthesized and then reduced and homogeneously dispersed into a PBS matrix. The internal structure of neat PBS and of the nanocomposite was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and wide angle X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystallization from the melt and from the glass studied at high cooling and heating rates via FSC appeared to be significantly promoted in the presence of graphene. The presence of secondary crystallization on heating and the higher crystal perfection observed were attributed to the formation of a graphene network inside the PBS matrix. The activation energies of melt and glass crystallization were combined in order to obtain one set of Hoffman-Lauritzen parameters for each system. Finally, the growth rate of PBS crystals appeared to be highly enhanced in the presence of graphene nanosheets. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85020258965,"At present, connections of photovoltaic (PV) systems to low-voltage (LV) distribution systems are growing rapidly because of the compliance with government policies, drop in the prices of PV technologies, and environmental awareness. Unfortunately, the high penetration of solar PV systems, which suffers from the intermittence of sunlight, leads to voltage fluctuation and voltage imbalance, thereby deteriorating the power quality. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a control strategy of the PV inverter to improve the limiting and balancing of voltage profiles in an unbalanced, three-phase, four-wire LV distribution system. The control strategy is based on the real power limitation and the reactive power adjustment through a control scheme function that is embedded in all PV inverters for supporting high penetration of PV systems. However, real power limitation leads to less utilization of solar energy. Then, the concern on PV generation (real power) regarding voltage fluctuation and imbalance is optimally analyzed by multi-objective particle swarm optimization. The optimal solution of the control scheme function is numerically demonstrated in a modified 29-node LV distribution system. © 2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

2-s2.0-85020271702,"AIM: To investigate the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in postoperative biliary atresia (BA) children and the association of bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical parameters in postKasai BA subjects. METHODS: A total of 70 patients with postKasai BA were enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were classified into two groups according to their jaundice status. BMD of the lumbar spine was analyzed using dual energy RESULTS: The prevalence of low bone mass (osteopenia and osteoporosis) in BA patients were 51.4% (36 out of 70). Ten patients (35.7%) in the jaundice group and 8 patients (19.0%) in the non-jaundice group had osteopenia. Sixteen patients (57.1%) in the jaundice group and 2 patients (4.8%) in the no jaundice group had osteoporosis. In addition, lumbar spine BMD Z-score was substantially lower in the jaundice BA patients compared with non-jaundice patients. BA subjects with persistent jaundice had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D than those without jaundice. Further analysis revealed that lumbar spine BMD was correlated with age (r = 0.774, P < 0.001), serum albumin (r = 0.333, P = 0.005), total bilirubin (r = -0.476, P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (r = -0.583, P < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (r = -0.428, P < 0.001), and alkaline phosphatase(r = -0.456, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Low BMD was associated with biochemical parameters reflecting the severity of cholestasis in postKasai BA patients."
2-s2.0-85020454782,"Peritoneal dialysis inevitability results in activation of inflammatory processes and its efficiency is highly variable between patients. An improved method to isolate biomarkers and study pathophysiological mechanisms in peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) is expected to be of much benefit for the development of this treatment approach and help with patient management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released as part of normal cellular processes. Their proteome is expected to reflect both type and health of their cell of origin. Although there is a significant interest in using EVs for ""liquid biopsies"", little is reported of their presence or composition in plentiful dialysis waste fluids, including peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE). Here we determined the presence of EVs in PDE and subsequently characterized their proteome. EVs were first isolated from PDE using differential centrifugation, then a further enrichment using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed. The presence of EVs was demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy, and their particle counts were investigated using nanoparticle tracking analysis and dynamic light scattering. Using tandem mass spectrometry, marker proteins from three types of EVs i.e. apoptotic bodies, ectosomes, and exosomes were identified. The proteomic results demonstrated that the isolation of EVs by differential centrifugation helped enrich for over 2,000 proteins normally masked by abundant proteins in PDE such as albumin and SEC markedly further improved the isolation of low abundant proteins. Gene ontology analysis of all identified proteins showed the marked enrichment of exosome and membrane-associated proteins. Over 3,700 proteins were identified in total, including many proteins with known roles in peritoneal pathophysiology. This study demonstrated the prominence of EVs in PDE and their potential value as a source of biomarkers for peritoneal dialysis patients. © 2017 Pearson et al.

2-s2.0-85019810458,"Background: This retrospective study aimed to report clinical outcomes of high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) and whole pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT) in intermediate- to high-risk localised prostate cancer and to gain a better understanding of how behavioural variability of patients from various ethnic origins affects clinical practice. Materials and methods: In total, 116 localised intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer patients who were treated during 2004-12 were enroled into the study. WPRT was delivered to the full pelvis (50 Gy per conventional fractionation) and two fractions (15 Gy per fraction) of high-dose rate brachytherapy were designed for all patients to the peripheral zone of McNeal. The reported results were biochemical control rate, toxicity profiles and behavioural variations of patients. Results: The median follow-up time was 51 months. The 4-year biochemical control rates, according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology was 93.1%. T stage was the prognostic factor for biochemical control. No significant differences in biochemical control could be identified across ethnic groups (p>0.05). Five patients developed grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Prior knowledge was commonly found among Caucasian patients and urinary functions seemed to be more concerned among Caucasian and Middle East patients than those from other ethnic origins. Conclusions: Clinical outcomes of intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer patients from various ethnic origins were comparable with that of the Caucasian-only population reported previously. A number of detected ethnic-related factors might be beneficial for treatment decision-making for patients with different cultural background and could be utilised to better personalise/optimise cancer care and aftercare. © 2017 Cambridge University Press."

Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between average sleep duration in various age-periods across the adult lifecourse, and risk of lung cancer mortality in Xuanwei, China. An ambidirectional cohort study was conducted in 42,422 farmers from Xuanwei, China. Participants or their surrogates were interviewed in 1992 to assess average sleep hours in the age periods of 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and -71 years, which were categorized as -7, 8 (reference), 9, and -10 hours/day. Vital status was followed until 2011. Sex-specific Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for lung cancer mortality in 1994-2011, adjusted for demographic, anthropometric, medical, and household characteristics. J-shaped relationships were found between average sleep duration and lung cancer mortality. The patterns were consistent across sex, age periods, and fuel usage. Compared with sleeping 8 hours/day on average, -7 hours/day was associated with significantly increased HRs ranging from 1.39 to 1.58 in ages -41 years in men, and 1.29 to 2.47 in ages -51 years in women. Furthermore, sleeping -10 hours/day was associated with significantly increased HRs ranging from 2.44 to 3.27 in ages -41 year in men, and 1.31 to 2.45 in ages -60 years in women. Greater and less than 8 hours/day of sleep in various age-periods may be associated with elevated risk of lung cancer mortality in Xuanwei, China. © 2017 AACR."
2-s2.0-85019571966,"Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) plays a key role in the induction of osteoclast (OC) cell fusion, as well as DC-mediated immune regulation. While DC-STAMP gene expression is upregulated in the gingival tissue with periodontitis, its pathophysiological roles in periodontitis remain unclear. To evaluate the effects of DC-STAMP in periodontitis, anti-DC-STAMP-monoclonal antibody (mAb) was tested in a mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis (n = 6-7/group) where Pasteurella pneumotropica (Pp)-reactive immune response activated T cells to produce receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which, in turn, promotes the periodontal bone loss via upregulation of osteoclastogenesis. DC-STAMP was expressed on the cell surface of mature multinuclear OCs, as well as immature mononuclear OCs, in primary cultures of RANKL-stimulated bone marrow cells. Anti-DC-STAMP-mAb suppressed the emergence of large, but not small, multinuclear OCs, suggesting that DC-STAMP is engaged in the late stage of cell fusion. Anti-DC-STAMP-mAb also inhibited pit formation caused by RANKL-stimulated bone marrow cells. Attachment of ligature to a second maxillary molar induced DC-STAMP messenger RNA and protein, along with elevated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) OCs and alveolar bone loss. As we expected, systemic administration of anti-DC-STAMP-mAb downregulated the ligature-induced alveolar bone loss. Importantly, local injection of anti-DC-STAMP-mAb also suppressed alveolar bone loss and reduced the total number of multinucleated TRAP+ cells in mice that received ligature attachment. Attachment of ligature induced significantly elevated tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and RANKL in the gingival tissue compared with the control site without ligature (P < 0.05), which was unaffected by local injection with either anti-DC-STAMP-mAb or control-mAb. Neither in vivo anti-Pp IgG antibody nor in vitro anti-Pp T-cell response and resultant production of RANKL was affected by anti-DC-STAMP-mAb. This study illustrated the roles of DC-STAMP in promoting local OC cell fusion without affecting adaptive immune responses to oral bacteria. Therefore, it is plausible that a novel therapeutic regimen targeting DC-STAMP could suppress periodontal bone loss. © International & American Associations for Dental Research."

We compared HPV genotypes in anal tissues (Bx) and anal liquid-based cytology fluid (LBC) from HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM. Methods Bx (32 normal, 41 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 22 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)), along with LBC from the same visit, were selected from 61 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative MSM who enrolled into a prospective cohort in Bangkok, Thailand. HPV genotyping was performed on Bx and LBC. Results Any HPV and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) prevalence were 63.2% and 60.0% in Bx and 71.6% and 62.1% in LBC, respectively. HIV-positive MSM had higher rates of HR-HPV genotypes detection (70.5% vs. 47.1%, p=0.03) in LBC than HIV-negative MSM. HPV16 (27%) was the most common HR-HPV found in HSIL tissue. In HIV-positive MSM, the frequency of HR-HPV detection increased with histopathologic grading in both Bx and LBC samples. HSIL was associated with the presence of any HR-HPV(OR 7.6 (95%CI 1.8–31.9); P=0.006) in LBC and in Bx((OR 5.6 (95%CI 1.4–22.7); P=0.02).

2-s2.0-85019026920,"Aims: This study aimed to biotype Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from tilapia farms in Thailand based on molecular biotyping methods and to determine the correlation between the serotype and virulence of bacteria. In addition to a biotyping (serotyping) technique based on multiplex PCR of cps genes, in this study, we developed multiplex PCR typing of Group B streptococcus (GBS) virulence genes to examine three clusters of virulence genes and their correlation with the pathogenicity of S. agalactiae. The epidemiology of S. agalactiae in Thailand was analysed to provide bacterial genetic information towards a future rational vaccine strategy for tilapia culture systems. Methods and Results: Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated from diseased tilapia from different areas of Thailand. A total of 124 S. agalactiae isolates were identified by phenotypic analysis and confirmed by 16S rRNA PCR. Bacterial genotyping was conducted based on (i) molecular serotyping of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene cluster and (ii) virulence gene profiling using multiplex PCR analysis of 14 virulence genes (lmb, scpB, pavA, cspA, spb1, cyl, bca, rib, fbsA, fbsB, cfb, hylB, bac and pbp1A/ponA). Only serotypes Ia and III were found in this study; serotype Ia lacks the lmb, scpB and spb1 genes, whereas serotype III lacks only the bac gene. Virulence tests in juvenile Nile tilapia demonstrated a correlation between the pathogenicity of the bacteria and their virulence gene profile, with serotype III showing higher virulence than serotype Ia. Epidemiological analysis showed an almost equal distribution in all regions of Thailand, except serotype III was found predominantly in the southern areas. Conclusions: Only two serotypes of S. agalactiae were isolated from diseased tilapia in Thailand. Serotype Ia showed fewer virulence genes and lower virulence than serotype III. Both serotypes showed a similar distribution throughout Thailand. Significance and Impact of the Study: We identified two major serotypes of S. agalactiae isolates associated with the outbreak in tilapia culture in Thailand. We developed multiplex PCR assays for 14 virulence genes, which may be used to predict the pathogenicity of the isolates and track future infections. Multiplex PCR typing of the GBS virulence genes was developed and might be further used to predict the pathogenicity of S. agalactiae. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology"

Methods Frozen urine samples obtained at baseline from patients in the TB research cohort with proven culture-positive TB were selected for blinded urine LAM testing. One hundred and nine patients were categorized into four groups: (1) HIV-positive patients with TB; (2) HIV-negative patients with disseminated TB; (3) HIV-negative immunocompromised patients with TB; and (4) patients with diseases other than TB. The sensitivity of urine LAM testing for culture-positive TB, specificity of urine LAM testing for patients without TB, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed. Results The sensitivity of the urine LAM test in group 1 patients with a CD4 T-cell count of >100, ≤100, and ≤50 cells/mm3 was 38.5%, 40.6%, and 45%, respectively. The specificity and PPV of the urine LAM test were >80%. The sensitivity of the test was 20% in group 2 and 12.5% in group 3, and the specificity and PPV were 100% for both groups. A positive urine LAM test result was significantly associated with death. Conclusions This promising diagnostic tool could increase the yield of TB diagnosis and may predict the mortality rate of TB infection, particularly in TB/HIV co-infected patients. © 2017 The Author(s)"

This species, described in the Philippines in the nineteenth century, has an uneasy taxonomic history and appears to be part of a complex of morphologically similar species, which has made its real identity difficult to determine. Comparison of samples of the genus Armina from Thailand with the original description of A. semperi showed that they were different.

2-s2.0-85017138354,"Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia), a classic example of a “flood pulse” system, is the largest freshwater lake in SE Asia, and is reported to have one of the highest freshwater fish productions anywhere. During the dry season (November–April) the lake drains through a tributary to the Mekong River. The flow in the connecting tributary completely reverses during the wet monsoon (May–October), adding huge volumes of water back to the lake, increasing its area about six fold. The lake is likely phosphorus limited and we hypothesized that groundwater discharge, including recirculated lake water, may represent an important source of P and other nutrients. To address this question, we surveyed hundreds of kilometers of the lake for natural 222Rn (radon), temperature, conductivity, GPS coordinates and water depth. All major inorganic nutrients and phosphorus species were evaluated by systematic sampling throughout the lake. Results showed that there were radon hotspots, all at the boundaries between the permanent lake and the floodplain, indicating likely groundwater inputs. A radon mass balance model indicates that the groundwater flow to Tonle Sap Lake is approximately 10 km3/yr, about 25% as large as the floodwaters entering from the Mekong River during the wet monsoon. Our results suggest that the groundwater-derived dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) contribution to Tonle Sap is more than 30% of the average inflows from all natural sources. Since the productivity of the lake appears to be phosphorus limited, this finding suggests that the role of groundwater is significant for Tonle Sap Lake and perhaps for other flood pulse systems worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85017132684,"Metalworking fluids (MWFs) are classified as hazardous substances. Due to the characteristics of the stable oil–water emulsions, it requires more costly and complicate treatment techniques to remove oil from spent MWFs. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a porous network material used to remove contaminants from environment. One of the most prominent of MOFs is HKUST-1 or Cu-BTC. In this study, the Cu-BTCs were prepared by solvothermal method in various conditions and used as absorbent for removing oil micelles in MWF emulsion. The particle size of all synthesized Cu-BTCs ranged from ≈ 80 to 400 nm. The ability of all synthesized Cu-BTCs to remove oil micelle was greater than 95% in 60 min, while the capacity of GAC was obtained the result for only 6.8%. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of oil micelles on Cu-BTCs was 1666.7 mg·g− 1. The highest removal capacity of oil micelles in MWF emulsion is greater than 99% in 24 h by using Cu-BTCs washed with either butanol or ethanol. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85016488321,"Infection with the mosquito transmitted dengue virus (DENV) remains a significant worldwide public health problem. While the majority of infections are asymptomatic, infection can result in a range of symptoms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through repression or degradation of mRNAs. To understand the contribution of miRNAs to DENV 2 replication, we screened a number of candidate miRNAs for variations in expression levels during DENV 2 infection of HepG2 (liver) cells. Seven miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed, and one, miR-21, was differentially expressed at all time points examined. Interestingly, miR-21 was also differentially regulated in DENV 2 infection under conditions of antibody dependent enhancement of infection, and in direct Zika virus infection, but not in DENV 4 infection. The role of miR-21 during DENV infection was further examined by treating HepG2 cells with an anti-miR-21 (AMO-21) before DENV infection. The results showed a significant reduction in DENV 2 production, clearly suggesting that miR-21 plays a key role in DENV 2 replication. To further confirm the role of miR-21 in DENV infection, a peptide nucleic acid-21 (PNA-21) construct with a nucleotide sequence complementary to AMO-21, was co-administered with AMO-21 as an AMO-21/PNA-21 complex followed by DENV 2 infection. The results showed that AMO-21 significantly reduced DENV 2 titer, PNA-21 significantly increased DENV 2 titer and the combined AMO-21/PNA-21 showed no difference from non-treated infection controls. Taken together, the results show that miR-21 promotes DENV 2 replication, and this mechanism could serve as a possible therapeutic intervention point. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85015791870,"The 2011 flood was the worst in Thailand in decades. Many of the impacts occurred in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The floods negatively affected small and medium enterprises (SMEs). One location in which high impacts on SMEs occurred was Bang Bua Thong market in Nonthaburi Province. The aim of this article is to investigate (1) how the 2011 floods affected SMEs in the market, (2) how successfully they have recovered, and (3) what actions they and the state have taken to reduce the vulnerability of SMEs to future floods. We found that the economic health of the market community has deteriorated since 2011 due to the damages caused by the floods, the poor state of the Thai economy, and increased business competition. The poor performance of the mayor during the event significantly contributed to the vulnerability of SMEs. So did the lack of an effective early warning system. Since 2011, the government has only made minor efforts to reduce flood risk. These have focused on building floodwalls to reduce risk to large-scale enterprises, which have redistributed risk to unprotected areas. No changes in land use have occurred, and hence, the drainage capacity of the market has improved little. The study revealed that socioeconomic factors interacted with the 2011 flood to negatively affect SMEs, and that key political economy drivers of vulnerability of SMEs remain unaddressed. The market has not been built back better, and the sociopolitical transformations needed to reduce vulnerability have not occurred. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

2-s2.0-85017410508,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the buccolingual inclination of second mandibular molars between groups with varying sagittal skeletal relationship of maxilla and mandible using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials and methods The sample consisted of 90 adult non-orthodontic treatment patients' CBCT images. They were divided into 3 groups according to sagittal skeletal pattern using Wits appraisal, which were skeletal Class I (13 men and 17 women), skeletal Class II (17 men and 13 women) and skeletal Class III (13 men and 17 women) with an average age of 37.6 years. All subjects had a normal vertical skeletal pattern and had mandibular deviation less than 3 mm. Buccolingual inclination was measured in a radiographic software as the angle between the long axis of lower second molars and a reference line tangent to the lower border of the mandibular body. Results There was a statistically significant difference of second mandibular molar buccolingual inclination between the three groups (p = 0.000), with a decreasing trend of the inclination angle from skeletal Class II to skeletal Class III. Wits appraisal had a moderate positive correlation with mandibular second molar buccolingual inclination (R = 0.648). Conclusion Pretreatment patients with different sagittal skeletal patterns have different buccolingual inclination of mandibular molars.

2-s2.0-85015312296,"Background Low back pain (LBP) is a major problem for office workers. Individuals adopting poor postures during prolonged sitting have a considerably increased risk of experiencing LBP. This study aimed to investigate seat pressure distribution characteristics, i.e., average pressure, peak pressure ratio, frequency of postural shift, and body perceived discomfort (BPD), during 1 hour of sitting among office workers with and without chronic LBP. Methods Forty-six participants (chronic LBP = 23, control = 23) typed a standardized text passage at a computer work station for an hour. A seat pressure mat device was used to collect the seat pressure distribution data. Body discomfort was assessed using the Body Perceived Discomfort scale. Results Office workers with chronic LBP sat significantly more asymmetrically than their healthy counterparts. During 1-hour sitting, all workers appeared to assume slumped sitting postures after 20 minutes of sitting. Healthy workers had significantly more frequent postural shifts than chronic LBP workers during prolonged sitting. Conclusion Different sitting characteristics between healthy and chronic LBP participants during 1 hour of sitting were found, including symmetry of sitting posture and frequency of postural shift. Further research should examine the roles of these sitting characteristics on the development of LBP. © 2017 The Authors"
2-s2.0-85017175515,"Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the number of basis images and the orientation of the skull on the evaluation of cortical alveolar bone in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Study Design Eleven skulls with a total of 59 anterior teeth were selected. CBCT images were acquired by using 4 protocols, by varying the rotation of the tube-detector arm and the orientation of the skull (protocol 1: 360°/0°; protocol 2: 180°/0°; protocol 3: 180°/90°; protocol 4: 180°/180°). Observers evaluated cortical bone as absent, thin, or thick. Direct observation of the skulls was used as the gold standard. Intra- and interobserver agreement, as well as agreement of scoring between the 3 bone thickness classifications, were calculated by using the κ statistic. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the 4 protocols. Results For lingual cortical bone, protocol 1 showed no statistical difference from the gold standard. Higher reliability was found in protocol 3 for absent (κ = 0.80) and thin (κ = 0.47) cortices, whereas for thick cortical bone, protocol 2 was more consistent (κ = 0.60). In buccal cortical bone, protocol 1 obtained the highest agreement for absent cortices (κ = 0.61), whereas protocol 4 was better for thin cortical plates (κ = 0.38) and protocol 2 for thick cortical plates (κ = 0.40). Conclusions No consistent effect of the number of basis images or head orientation for visual detection of alveolar bone was detected, except for lingual cortical bone, for which full rotation scanning showed improved visualization. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85015182940,"Background: We assessed the treatment outcomes on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), and factors associated with switching regimen in HIV-infected children treated through the universal coverage health program (UC) in Thailand. Methods: Children aged <15 years at ART initiation who had been receiving ART for at least 6 months between 2008 and 2014 through UC were included in the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate immunological recovery (IMR), immunological failure, and virological failure (VF). Cox models were used to assess predictors of IMR and VF. Competing risk models were used to assess factors associated with switching to a second-line regimen, with death considered as a competing risk. Results: A total of 4120 children initiated ART at a median (interquartile range) age of 9.3 (5.8-12.0) years. The median duration of ART was 3.7 years with 17,950 person-years of follow-up. Two thousand eight hundred five children achieved IMR, and the probability of IMR increased to 76% by 3 years after ART initiation. Among 1054 children switched to second-line regimens, 84% had VF and 19% had immunological failure. The cumulative rate of switching regimen increased from 4% to 20% from 1 to 3 years after treatment. Children aged ≥12 years at ART initiation, starting with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and baseline CD4% <10% had an increased risk of switching to second-line regimens. Conclusions: Children receiving ART through UC had good treatment outcomes, although a fifth required switching regimen by 3 years. Earlier treatment initiation and avoiding nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor first-line regimens in high-risk children may prevent treatment failure. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-85014488684,"The leaves of Aquilaria crassna (Thymelaeaceae) are recently become an attractive research due to their potential in antioxidative, antibacterial, antipyretic, analgesic, and laxative activities. However, the neuritogenic and neuroprotective effects of A. crassna leaves have never been reported. In this study, three phenolic glycosides were isolated from A. crassna leaves. The isolates were identified as genkwanin 5-O-β-primevoside (1), iriflophenone 3,5-C-β-d-diglucoside (2) and iriflophenone 3-C-β-d-glucoside (3). The neuroprotective and neuritogenic activities of these compounds were evaluated. Compound 1 and 2, at very low concentration (100 ng/mL of compound 1 and 1 ng/mL of compound 2), exhibited the protection of P19-derived neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of the cultured neurons. In addition, a preliminary study on these compounds revealed that there was no correlation between their antioxidative properties and their neuroprotective activities. Practical applications: Agarwood leaves have been used as an ingredient in foods and drinks for health promotion in Asian countries. The results of this study also suggest that Aquilaria crassna leaves are potentially sources of neuritogenic and neuroprotective constituents, which may be developed as functional foods for the prevention of neurodegenerative disorder. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85013626257,"Rhodamine derivatives grafted on polyacrylic acid (PAA) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as a Au3+-selective chemosensor using the rhodamine ring-opening approach. The fluorogenic and chromogenic polymer chemosensors (PAA-Rho1-PAA-Rho4) were constructed via a coupling reaction between PAA and alkylene polyamine groups possessing a different number of donor atoms and chain lengths to yield PAA-Rho1 (84.2%), PAA-Rho2 (80.3%), PAA-Rho3 (91.9%), and PAA-Rho4 (85.1%). Chemical structures and purity of polymeric sensors were characterized by TGA, NMR, SEM and IR. The complexation studies indicate that PAA-Rho3 exhibited the highest selectivity and sensitivity responsive colorimetric and fluorescence Au3+-specific sensor when compared to other metal ions and polymeric sensors. The polymeric sensors are non-fluorescence in the spirolactam form and could be selectively converted into the fluorescence ring-opened amide form in the presence of Au3+, leading to the fluorescence enhancements and colorimetric changes. In addition, the fluorescent conjugated polymer film as the chemosensors were fabricated by chemical modification on ITO substrate, which created new fluorescent film sensors (PAA-Rho3-ITO). Further study showed that the sensing process is reversible by rinsing with EDTA solutions; the lower detection limit was less than that obtained from uncoated polymer film PAA-Rho3, and the response time was less than 40 s. The super sensitive response, good reversibility, and very fast response time, make the fluorescent film sensors a promising Au3+ sensor for environmental and biological applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85008144312,"In order to assess the effects of phosphate, silicate and natural organic matter (NOM) on arsenic removal by ferric chloride, batch coprecipitation experiments were conducted over a wide pH range using synthetic hard and soft groundwaters, similar to those found in northern Vietnam. The efficiency of arsenic removal from synthetic groundwater by coprecipitation with FeCl3 was remarkably decreased by the effects of PO4 3−, SiO4 4− and NOM. The negative effects of SiO4 4− and NOM on arsenic removal were not as strong as that of PO4 3−. Combining PO4 3− and SiO4 4− increased the negative effects on both arsenite (As3+) and arsenate (As5+) removal. The introduction of NOM into the synthetic groundwater containing both PO4 3− and SiO4 4− markedly magnified the negative effects on arsenic removal. In contrast, both Ca2+ and Mg2+ substantially increased the removal of As3+ at pH 8–12 and the removal of As5+ over the entire pH range. In the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, the interaction of NOM with Fe was either removed or the arsenic binding to Fe−NOM colloidal associations and/or dissolved complexes were flocculated. Removal of arsenic using coprecipitation by FeCl3 could not sufficiently reduce arsenic contents in the groundwater (350 μg/L) to meet the WHO guideline for drinking water (10 μg/L), especially when the arsenic-rich groundwater also contains co-occurring solutes such as PO4 3−, SiO4 4− and NOM; therefore, other remediation processes, such as membrane technology, should be introduced or additionally applied after this coprecipitation process, to ensure the safety of drinking water. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, its residues in animal products can pose adverse side effects to consumer. Therefore, detection of the residue in different food matrices must be concerned. In this study, a single chain variable fragment (scFv) that recognizes norfloxacin antibiotic was constructed. The cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of hybridoma cells against norfloxacin. Genes encoding VH and VL regions of monoclonal antibody against norfloxacin (Nor155) were amplified and size of VH and VL fragments was 402 bp and 363 bp, respectively. The scFv of Nor155 was constructed by an addition of (Gly4Ser)3 as a linker between VH and VL regions and subcloned into pPICZαA, an expression vector of Pichia pastoris. The sequence of scFv Nor155 (GenBank No. AJG06891.1) was confirmed by sequencing analysis. The complementarity determining regions (CDR) I, II, and III of VH and VL were specified by Kabat method.

Direct DNA sequencing of α-globin genes can be technically challenging, as α1- and α2-globin genes are nearly indistinguishable. To detect hemoglobin variants (HbXs) on Hb analysis, the entire β- and α-globin genes were directly sequenced using a newly developed sequencing protocol for α-globin genes. An algorithm to distinguish between α- and β-HbXs was constructed and subsequently validated in the independent validation group. Distinctive characteristics that can distinguish 39 α-HbXs from 24 β-HbXs were the presence of unidentifiable variants of HbA2 and/or HbX of <37% on isoelectric focusing and <31% on high-performance liquid chromatography. Another set of 67 HbXs was employed to validate our algorithm. This accurately predicted 33 α-HbXs with 100% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity. Our sequencing protocol for α-globin genes was able to identify 11 rare mutations among all exons of both α-globin genes from 72 subjects. Six of these variants were first discovered in Thais. This is the first well-characterized algorithm for distinguishing unknown Hb variants in a large cohort.

However, the mechanism by which bFGF regulates REX1 expression in stem cells, isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of REX1 expression by bFGF in SHEDs. SHEDs were isolated and characterized. Their mRNA and protein expression levels were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. In some experiments, chemical inhibitors were added to the culture medium to impede specific signaling pathways. Cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous tooth dental pulp tissue expressed mesenchymal stem cell surface markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105). These cells differentiated into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, when appropriately induced. Treating SHEDs with bFGF induced REX1 mRNA expression and this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with FGFR or Akt inhibitors. Cycloheximide pretreatment also inhibited the bFGF-induced REX1 expression, implying the involvement of intermediate molecule(s). Further, the addition of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody attenuated the bFGF-induced REX1 expression by SHEDs. In conclusion, bFGF enhanced REX1 expression by SHEDs via the FGFR and Akt signaling pathways. Moreover, IL-6 participated in the bFGF-induced REX1 expression in SHEDs. J. Cell.

2-s2.0-85007453688,"Background: Filler injections for sunken upper eyelid correction and glabellar augmentation at the orbitoglabellar region need to be performed correctly. Precise knowledge of the emerging sites of all terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery is essential for these procedures to be conducted safely. Methods: The terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery were studied in both periorbital and intraorbital dissections. The aim of this study was to verify the critical positions of the emerging sites at the orbital septum that may act as potential retrograde channels for filler emboli. Results: In the 40 eyes examined, the branches of the ophthalmic artery were found to emerge from four different sites. Two substantial emerging sites were situated on both sides of the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle. These sites were located at the superior part of the medial orbital rim (SMOR) and are alternatively named as the epitrochlear and the subtrochlear emerging sites. The other two sites can be regarded as accessory emerging sites due to the comparably smaller artery. Dissection of the intraorbital region revealed small periosteal branches of the infraorbital artery which coursed anteriorly on the orbital floor to form anastomoses with the lacrimal artery. In other areas of the orbital floor, no branches extended from the infraorbital artery. In front of the lacrimal gland, very minute branches descended and coursed along both margins of the superior tarsus but did not course outside the lateral orbital rim. Conclusion: A danger zone was located at the SMOR, where the ophthalmic branches emerge to form anastomotic channels. Compression at the trochlea guarantees safe injection of filler, reducing the risk of complication. No Level Assigned: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

2-s2.0-85014003896,"The facile preparation of porous carbon monolith electrodes as a supercapacitor was demonstrated using rubber wood wastes treated with NaOH or H3PO4 as starting materials. Different concentrations of treating solutions were used (5 and 10% w/v). The effect of the pore structures of the porous carbon electrodes on their electrochemical performance and which parameters played important roles in the specific capacitance were also studied. The results revealed that the H3PO4-activated samples had microporous characteristics and a specific surface area of 605–693 m2/g, while the NaOH-activated samples exhibited mesoporous characteristics with a developed mesopore volume of 0.27 cm3/g. The specific surface area tended to increase with an increased H3PO4 concentration but decreased with an increased NaOH concentration. As confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometry, oxygenated functional groups (OGF) were detected in all samples. Notwithstanding, a pseudo-Faradaic reaction as a result of OGF occurred only with the reference carbon and H3PO4-activated samples, while NaOH-activated samples with OGF exhibited ideal electrical double-layer capacitor behavior. Measured at 1 mV/s in 1 M H2SO4 solution, a carbon electrode prepared from 10% w/v H3PO4-treated rubber wood exhibited the maximum gravimetric capacitance of 129 F/g, a volumetric capacitance of 104 F/cm3, an energy density of 14.2 Wh/kg, and a power density of 500 W/kg. The results also showed that the mesopore volume and the average pore size rather than the specific surface area played important roles in the specific capacitance, but only when the percentage difference in the specific surface area between the two samples did not exceed 41%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85006355741,"This study uses multi-state cohort component projections and detailed vital statistics data to project the future Taiwanese population by age, sex, and education up to 2050. These are the first education-specific population projections for Taiwan, and they reveal how young highly educated cohorts during the next decades will replace older cohorts with lower levels of educational attainment. The results of the population projections enter our estimation of the future composition of the Taiwanese labor force. Incorporating education as an extra dimension in labor force projections allows us to make inferences about the quality of future labor supply in a rapidly aging Taiwan and the leverage of expanding economic activity across the life course, particularly of women. At present, women’s economic activity above age 25 in Taiwan is significantly lower than men’s and also much lower than women's in Western developed nations. Some of the expected adverse economic consequences of population aging can likely be alleviated by having a more educated and consequently more productive labor force. The overall results and conclusions of our study, though based on the Taiwanese context, apply to other Asian economies with rapidly aging populations and currently comparatively low levels of female labor force participation as well. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
2-s2.0-85007583353,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a high incidence of relapse in pediatric ALL. Although most T-ALL patients exhibit activating mutations in NOTCH1, the cooperating genetic events required to accelerate the onset of leukemia and worsen disease progression are largely unknown. Here, we show that the gene encoding the transcription factor KLF4 is inactivated by DNA methylation in children with T-ALL. In mice, loss of KLF4 accelerated the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL by enhancing the G1-to-S transition in leukemic cells and promoting the expansion of leukemia-initiating cells. Mechanistically, KLF4 represses the gene encoding the kinase MAP2K7. Our results showed that in murine and pediatric T-ALL, loss of KLF4 leads to aberrant activation of MAP2K7 and of the downstream effectors JNK and ATF2. As a proof-of-concept for the development of a targeted therapy, administration of JNK inhibitors reduced the expansion of leukemia cells in cell-based and patient-derived xenograft models. Collectively, these data uncover a novel function for KLF4 in regulating the MAP2K7 pathway in T-ALL cells, which can be targeted to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in T-ALL patients. © 2017 The Author(s)."

2-s2.0-85002125795,"When a feedback system has components described by non-rational transfer functions, a standard practice in designing such a system is to replace the non-rational functions with rational approximants and then carry out the design with the approximants by means of a method that copes with rational systems. In order to ensure that the design carried out with the approximants still provides satisfactory results for the original system, a criterion of approximation should be explicitly taken into account in the design formulation. This paper derives such a criterion for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) feedback systems whose design objective is to ensure that the absolute values of every error and every controller output components always stay within prescribed bounds whenever the inputs satisfy certain bounding conditions. The obtained criterion generalizes a known result which was derived for single-input single-output (SISO) systems; furthermore, for a given rational approximant matrix, it is expressed as a set of inequalities that can be solved in practice. Finally, a controller for a binary distillation column is designed by using the criterion in conjunction with the method of inequalities. The numerical results clearly demonstrate that the usefulness of the criterion in obtaining a design solution for the original system. © 2016, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

2-s2.0-84998854141,"The migratory and proliferative capabilities of the epithelial cell on the surface of gastro-intestinal (GI) tract are important for wound healing. As aspartame is one of the most common artificial sweeteners in use in a variety of food products, knowledge regarding its effect on the wound healing behaviors of epithelial cells in the GI tract is of interest. The present study has revealed for the first time that aspartame at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited intestinal epithelial cell migration determined by both wound healing and Boyden chamber cell migration assays, while it had no effect on the proliferation of the cells. Furthermore, the number of lamellipodia per cell significantly reduced in aspartame-treated cells. In terms of molecular mechanisms, the study found that aspartame suppressed the cellular levels of the migration regulatory proteins namely, integrins, activated FAK, activated Akt, Cav-1, RhoA-GTP, and Rac1-GTP. Altogether, the study reports that aspartame may affect intestinal wound healing capability through suppression of cell migration. Practical applications: Aspartame is an artificial sweetener widely used in various food products. Although many studies regarding the toxicity of aspartame have been conducted, the effects of aspartame on intestinal epithelial cell migration and proliferation have not been much investigated. The results of the present study indicate that aspartame has a significant inhibitory effect on intestinal epithelial cell migration with well-defined underlying mechanisms. The present study provides additional molecular mechanistic information of this substance on epithelial cells and may serve to trigger further investigations that could lead to cautionary recommendations in the use of aspartame in those suffering GI ulcers or other high-risk populations. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-84995451816,"Hyper-elevated immune response of FcGRIIb-/- mice, a lupus model with an inhibitory-signaling defect, can become exhausted (less subsequent immune-response than the first response) with sequential lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Endotoxin tolerance-related modifications of inflammatory response were investigated in FcGRIIb-/- mice in both an in vivo sepsis model and in vitro using cultured macrophages. Serum cytokine concentrations, after the second LPS injection (at 5-fold higher levels than the first dose), did not exceed the first dose levels in either FcGRIIb-/- or wild-type mice. These data indicated an endotoxin-tolerance response in both genetic backgrounds. However, the difference of cytokine levels between the first and second LPS injection was more prominent in FcGRIIb-/- mice. More importantly, CLP-induced sepsis after LPS-preconditioning (two separated doses of LPS administration) was more severe in FcGRIIb-/- mice (as measured by mortality rate, bacteria count in blood, serum cytokines, creatinine, and alanine transaminase). An attenuated response was demonstrated after two sequential LPS stimulations of bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Cytokine production was reduced and lower bacterial killing activity occurred with macrophages from FcGRIIb-/- mice relative to wild-type macrophages. Thus, there is a more prominent effect of endotoxin-tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- macrophages relative to wild-type. In conclusion, repeated-LPS administrations induced quantitatively greater endotoxin-tolerance responses in FcGRIIb-/- mice both in vivo and in vitro. Endotoxin-tolerance in vivo was associated with more severe sepsis, at least in part, due to macrophage-dysfunction. Copyright © 2016 by the Shock Society."

Material and Methods: Human PDL cells were isolated from periodontal tissue and incubated with 0–10 ng/mL of IL-12 for 24 h. The levels of expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), as well as of the stem cell markers, CD73, CD90 and CD105, were assessed by quantitative PCR. The level of IFN-γ protein was measured by ELISA, and IDO activity was measured by activity assay. The participation of IFN-γ in the expression of IDO and HLA-G was analyzed using neutralizing antibody against IFN-γ. Results: IL-12 upregulated the expression of IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-12 induced the expression of the immunomodulatory proteins IDO and HLA-G via an IFN-γ-dependent pathway, as indicated by experiments using an IFN-γ neutralizing antibody. Addition of exogenous IFN-γ upregulated the expression of HLA-G and IDO. Expression of the stem cell markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, as well as the pluripotent markers Nanog homeobox, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box 2, were also upregulated in IL-12-treated hPDL cells. Finally, IL-12 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of the hPDL cells and preserved the self-clonal expansion property of these cells, as assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and the colony-forming unit assay. Conclusion: Expression of IL-12 during periodontitis may play an important role in the control of the inflammatory response via the induction of immunosuppressive molecules by hPDL cells. We hypothesize that this immunomodulatory property of IL-12 will serve as a protective mechanism to preserve a population of stem cells under inflammatory conditions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-85002645155,"The properties and changes of an o/w emulsion(mayonnaise) as affected by the replacement of long-chain fatty acid oil with medium-chain fatty acid oil were studied. Different ratios of coconut oil (CNO) and rice bran oil (RBO) (0:100, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70 and 40:60 (v/v)) were blended as the oil base for the study. The highest replacement of RBO with CNO in an o/w emulsion that could be achieved with minimal change of sensory properties was 30%. The Emulsion Stability Index and oil-phase crystallisation temperatures of mayonnaise with RBO alone and with 30% CNO replacement did not change when stored at 30±2°C for 4 weeks. The droplet size of the mayonnaise containing only RBO increased, possibly due to droplet coalescence. In contrast, the droplet size of the mayonnaise with CNO:RBO=30:70 did not change during storage. © Copyright by Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. © 2017 Author(s)."

This study investigated quantitative imaging capabilities at sites with a variety of experience and equipment and assessed levels of errors in activity quantitation in Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and planar imaging. Participants from 9 countries took part in a comparison in which planar, SPECT and SPECT with X ray computed tomography (SPECT-CT) imaging were used to quantify activities of four epoxy-filled cylinders containing 133Ba, which was chosen as a surrogate for 131I. The sources, with nominal volumes of 2, 4, 6 and 23 mL, were calibrated for 133Ba activity by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, but the activity was initially unknown to the participants. Imaging was performed in a cylindrical phantom filled with water. Two trials were carried out in which the participants first estimated the activities using their local standard protocols, and then repeated the measurements using a standardized acquisition and analysis protocol. Finally, processing of the imaging data from the second trial was repeated by a single centre using a fixed protocol. In the first trial, the activities were underestimated by about 15% with planar imaging. SPECT with Chang's first order attenuation correction (Chang-AC) and SPECT-CT overestimated the activity by about 10%. The second trial showed moderate improvements in accuracy and variability. Planar imaging was subject to methodological errors, e.g., in the use of a transmission scan for attenuation correction. The use of Chang-AC was subject to variability from the definition of phantom contours. The project demonstrated the need for training and standardized protocols to achieve good levels of quantitative accuracy and precision in a multicentre setting. Absolute quantification of simple objects with no background was possible with the strictest protocol to about 6% with planar imaging and SPECT (with Chang-AC) and within 2% for SPECT-CT. © 2016"
2-s2.0-84979300188,"Background: There is limited evidence of medication adherence related to progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine associations between medication adherence and the progression of CKD in outpatients with CKD. Methods: This cohort study recruited 339 Thai patients with stages 3–5 CKD. Patients with a glomerular disease or receiving renal replacement therapy before recruitment were excluded. 295 were followed up regarding their serum creatinine, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol over 12 months. Medication adherence was measured at baseline using the Thai version of the 8-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale®. The primary outcome was the progression of CKD. The progression of CKD was defined as either a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year or initiation of renal replacement therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regressions. Results: Twenty-one percent had poor adherence. Younger patients were more likely to have poor adherence (adjusted OR 2.81, 95 % CI 1.45–5.43). Anti-hypertensive agents were the most frequently reported as not being taken (52 %). Patients with poor adherence were associated with the progression of CKD (adjusted OR 1.96, 95 % CI 1.02–3.76). Those with poor adherence were less likely to control their blood pressure, than moderate-to-high adherence group (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings suggest that CKD patients with poor medication adherence are more likely to have progression of CKD. Health care providers should acknowledge these findings and provide effective strategies to deal with this issue. © 2016, Japanese Society of Nephrology."
2-s2.0-84966681631,"In order to determine the prospective areas of the forthcoming earthquake sources, the b-values of the frequency-magnitude earthquake distributions were analyzed spatially and mapped along the strike-slip fault system at the Thailand-Myanmar border. In order to constrain the relationship between the variation of b and the following hazardous earthquake, the completeness of earthquake catalogue was manipulated into two datasets for (i) 1980-2000 and (ii) 1980-2005 and the b-values mapped. Utilizing the suitable assumption of 30 fixed earthquake events, the following Mw ≥ 5.0 earthquakes illustrate a significant relation between their epicenter and the areas showing relatively low b-values. By utilizing the most recent earthquake data (1980-2015), five areas exhibiting low b-values (implying prospective earthquake sources) can be identified along the strike-slip fault system. Compared with earthquake activities evaluated previously along the strike-slip fault system, the data reveal that these five areas may potentially generate earthquakes up to 7.0Mw within the coming 50 years; the recurrence of the Mw-5.0 earthquake is about 10 years and the probabilities of the Mw-5.0 earthquake are about 40-95%, respectively. Since these prospective hazardous seismic zones are located close to cities, population centers and hydropower dams, an effective mitigation plan should be developed. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company."
2-s2.0-84992739291,"Exposure to compounds with cancer-potentiating effects can contribute to the progression of cancer. Herein we have discovered for the first time that benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a chemical used as sunscreen in various cosmetic products, enhances the ability of lung cancer cells to undergo metastasis. The exposure of the lung cancer cells to BP-3 at non-toxic concentrations significantly increased the number of anoikis resistant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, BP-3 increased the growth rate as well as the number of colonies accessed by anchorage-independent growth assay. We found that the underlying mechanisms of such behaviors were the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of cancer cells, and the increase in caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression. As both mechanistic events mediated anoikis resistance via augmentation of cellular survival signals, our results further revealed that the BP-3 treatment significantly up-regulated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Also, such compounds increased the cellular levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins. As the presence of a substantial level of BP-3 in plasma of the consumers has been reported, this finding may facilitate further investigations that lead to better understanding and evidence concerning the safety of use in cancer patients. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

2-s2.0-84980329240,"This paper presents the analysis of undrained face stability of tunnels in Bangkok subsoils. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses were employed to analyse the 2D plane strain conditions of transverse (2DT) and longitudinal (2DL) sections as well as the full 3D geometry, respectively. The simplified geometry of 2DT corresponds to the circular face of tunnels subjected to a uniform face pressure, while that of 2DL correspond to the plane strain heading applied by a uniform face pressure at the front plane. For the 2D plane strain transverse and longitudinal sections, the tunnel lining was not considered in the analyses. For 3D cases, tunnel linings were included in the analysis and modelled as the rigid plate element with the fully rough surface along their lengths, while the tunnel face was subjected a face pressure. For all cases, the uniform surcharge was applied all over the ground surface. Strength reduction methods in conjunction with 2D and 3D finite element analyses were employed to determine the stability and the factor of safety of this problem. The stability analyses included ranges of tunnel face pressure measured during the tunnelling process. Effects of three-dimensional stability of tunnel face were also presented and discussed in this paper. Results of analyses were verified and compared with existing methods. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-84988911824,"Curcumin is a natural product with many interesting pharmacological properties. However, these are offset by the particularly poor biopharmaceutical properties. The oral bioavailability of curcumin in humans is very low, mainly due to low solubility, poor stability, and extensive metabolism. This has led to multiple approaches to improve bioavailability, including administration of curcumin with metabolism inhibitors, formulation into nanoparticles, modification of the curcumin structure, and development of curcumin prodrugs. In this paper, we focus on the pharmacokinetic outcomes of these approaches. Pharmacokinetic parameters of curcumin after release from prodrugs are dependent on the linker between curcumin and the promoiety, and the release itself may depend on the physiological and enzymatic environment at the site of cleavage. This is an area in which more data are required for rational design of improved linkers. Cytotoxicity of curcumin prodrugs seems to correlate well with cellular uptake in vitro, but the in vivo relevance is uncertain. We conclude that improved experimental and theoretical models of absorption of curcumin prodrugs, development of accurate analytical methods for simultaneous measurement of plasma levels of prodrug and released curcumin, and acquisition of more pharmacokinetic data in animal models for dose prediction in humans are required to facilitate movement of curcumin prodrugs into clinical trials. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

2-s2.0-84937053705,"This study investigates the impact of organization structure on corporate demand for reinsurance. Previous research has shown that the unique corporate groupings in Japan known as the “keiretsu” have relatively low bankruptcy costs, low agency conflicts, low information asymmetry, and low effective taxes. These conditions should mitigate the benefits of reinsurance purchase. This conjecture is tested by examining demand for reinsurance of Japanese non-life insurance companies during 1974–2010. Consistent with the prediction, keiretsu non-life insurers have lower reinsurance purchase than independent non-life insurance companies. The effects of the keiretsu structure also receded when keiretsu groupings' power was weakened after the asset bubble burst and the breakdown of the convoy system in mid 1990s. Consistent with previous studies, Japanese mutual insurers also purchase more reinsurance than stock insurers. © 2015 The Journal of Risk and Insurance"

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore risk factors pulmonary impairment. The exposed workers had higher respirable wood dust exposure (0.902 mg/m3) compared with the unexposed groups (0.185 mg/m3). The exposed group had significantly higher prevalence than the unexposed group for chest tightness (odds ratio (OR) = 2.79) and shortness of breath (OR = 2.27). The ventilatory function values (FEV1 and FVC) were lower for the exposed group compared with the unexposed group (2.41 vs 2.55 L/s and 2.91 vs 3.01 L/s, respectively).

2-s2.0-84984706715,"Separation of nanoscale oil droplets in the cutting-oil emulsion by electrocoagulation–flotation (ECF) was carried out in a bubble column reactor (BCR) and an external-loop airlift reactor (ALR). Under the batch operation, aluminium electrode provided the highest efficiency of 99% and required the shortest separating time compared to iron and graphite electrodes. The separation performance was also affected by the electrode gap and current density due to the amount of produced aluminium ions and turbulence by bubble motions. Additionally, the ECF efficiency obtained from the ALR was similar to that of the BCR. However, the ALR was preferable owing to its lower energy consumption, less electrode sacrifice, and less sludge production. Similar results were acquired under the continuous mode; nevertheless, the highest efficiency of only 85% was achieved from both reactors. It was found that the efficiency declined with increasing flow rates. According to the results suggested by the residence time distribution (RTD), the ALR was more effective at higher flow rates since the plug flow condition can be retained. On the other hand, an increase in flow rate also provoked the bypass flow to the down-comer of the ALR, resulting in the presence of a dead zone and reduction in the treatment efficiency. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85019889916,"Pesticide residues (PRs) in market vegetables have been reported regularly. Greengrocers may be exposed to several sorts of PRs on vegetables through hand contact. Health risk assessment from occupational exposure to PRs on vegetables is particularly concerning. This study was conducted among 91 vegetable vendors at a large fresh market in Bangkok. Hand wipe samples were collected in the dry season to extract and analyze PRs including organophosphates (OPs), pyrethroids (PYs), and carbamates (CAs) by gas chromatography (GC-FPD/GC-μECD) and liquid chromatography (LC–MS). The results showed that all wipe samples contained OPs, PYs, and CAs, mainly chlorpyrifos (0.01–0.14 µg/hands) and cypermethrin (0.42–11.64 µg/hands). The frequently detected PRs were aldicarb (87.2%), carbofuran (69.2%), permethrin (63.7%), and profenofos (60.0%). At 99th percentile values of PR exposure, average daily dose was 2.42 × 10−5 mg/kg/d and hazard index did not exceed the acceptable level (0.287). Glove wearing, hand washing, and work-related factors were significantly associated with PRs on hands after adjusted for gender (p-value < 0.05). Greengrocers may therefore not be at risk from PRs on vegetables and exposure via hands during their work. However, these findings suggest that proper personal hygiene practices among greengrocers should be considered to prevent them from PR exposure and potential health risks. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2-s2.0-84965057105,"According to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, oral bioavailability of drugs is determined by their aqueous solubility and the ability of the dissolved drug molecules to permeate lipophilic biological membranes. Similarly topical bioavailability of ophthalmic drugs is determined by their solubility in the aqueous tear fluid and their ability to permeate the lipophilic cornea. Enabling pharmaceutical excipients such as cyclodextrins can have profound effect on the drug bioavailability. However, to fully appreciate such enabling excipients, the relationship between their effects and the physicochemical properties of the permeating drug needs to be known. In this study, the permeation enhancing effect of γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) on saturated drug solutions containing hydrocortisone (HC), irbesartan (IBS), or telmisartan (TEL) was evaluated using cellophane and fused cellulose-octanol membranes in a conventional Franz diffusion cell system. The flux (J), the flux ratio (JR) and the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) demonstrate that γCD increases drug permeability. However, its efficacy depends on the drug properties. Addition of γCD increased Papp of HC (unionized) and IBS (partially ionized) through the dual membrane but decreased the Papp of TEL (fully ionized) that displays low complexation efficacy.

The effects of BA-a resin content on the thermal, mechanical and multiple-shape memory properties were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, a flexural test and a multiple-shape memory test. The results revealed that the suitable curing conversions of BA-a:PU resin mixtures affect the shape memory behaviors. The BA-a/PU copolymers demonstrated an increase in flexural strength and flexural modulus at various deformation temperatures with an increase in the BA-a mass ratio from 55%-80%, whereas the thermal properties of these binary systems, i.e. glass transition temperature (T g), degradation temperature (T d) and char yield, were also found to increase with an increase in BA-a content. In addition, the two-step bending test was carried out using a universal testing machine to evaluate the multiple-shape memory properties.

While the adsorption can successfully be examined in Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulations using the common approximation of a rigid lattice, the dynamics of methane in ZIF-90 is remarkably influenced by the lattice flexibility. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only show a strong influence of the lattice flexibility on the diffusion of methane but even find a slight structural phase transition of the lattice. This structural change appeared at higher temperatures and was not caused by the content of guest molecules like in most former discoveries of gate opening. For prediction of mixed gas ZIF-90 membrane selectivity, the adsorption and diffusion results show that the high CH4 adsorption selectivity is overcompensated by the high H2 mobility. The comparison of our results for the H2/CH4 membrane selectivity with experimental findings from mixed gas permeation through supported ZIF-90 membranes shows better agreement than other simulations that use a rigid lattice for MD.

However, the properties of the doped titania films depend greatly on the production method, source of doping, type of substrate, etc. The present work describes the use of pulsed direct current (pDC) magnetron sputtering for the deposition of carbon-doped titania coatings, using CO2 as the source of carbon; ratios of O2/CO2 were varied through variations of CO2 flow rates and oxygen flow control setpoints. Additionally, undoped Titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings were prepared under identical deposition conditions for comparison purposes. Coatings were post-deposition annealed at 873 K and analysed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffreaction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic properties of the thin films were evaluated under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light irradiation using methylene blue and stearic acid decomposition tests. Photoinduced hydrophilicity was assessed through measurements of the water contact angle under UV and visible light irradiation. It was found that, though C-doping resulted in improved dye degradation compared to undoped TiO2, the UV-induced photoactivity of Carbon-doped (C-doped) photocatalysts was lower for both model pollutants used. © 2017 by the authors.

It has been found that the natural rubber compound with CBS accelerator shows the fastest sulfur vulcanization rate and the lowest activation energy (Ea) because CBS accelerator produces higher level of basicity of amine species than other sulfenamide accelerators, further forming a complex structure with zinc ion as ligand in sulfur vulcanization. Because of the fastest cure rate of CBS accelerator, natural rubber foam with CBS accelerator shows the smallest bubble size and narrowest bubble size distribution.

2-s2.0-85020652243,"The development of simple fluorescent and colorimetric assays that enable point-of-care DNA and RNA detection has been a topic of significant research because of the utility of such assays in resource limited settings. The most common motifs utilize hybridization to a complementary detection strand coupled with a sensitive reporter molecule. Here, a paper-based colorimetric assay for DNA detection based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-induced nanoparticle aggregation is reported as an alternative to traditional colorimetric approaches. PNA probes are an attractive alternative to DNA and RNA probes because they are chemically and biologically stable, easily synthesized, and hybridize efficiently with the complementary DNA strands. The acpcPNA probe contains a single positive charge from the lysine at C-terminus and causes aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the absence of complementary DNA. In the presence of target DNA, formation of the anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results in dispersion of the AgNPs as a result of electrostatic repulsion, giving rise to a detectable color change. Factors affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of this assay were investigated, including ionic strength, AgNP concentration, PNA concentration, and DNA strand mismatches. The method was used for screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA based on a colorimetric paper-based analytical device developed using the aforementioned principle. The oligonucleotide targets were detected by measuring the color change of AgNPs, giving detection limits of 1.53 (MERS-CoV), 1.27 (MTB), and 1.03 nM (HPV). The acpcPNA probe exhibited high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch, and noncomplementary DNA targets.

The ET rates were obtained with atomic coordinates of the proteins determined by a method of molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and an ET theory using the reported experimental fluorescence decays of the FBPs. The value of the net electrostatic energy (NetES) between the photo-products and ionic groups inside the proteins increased in magnitude upon the dimer formation in every mutated FBP. Dependencies in the logarithmic ET rate (ln Rate) on the donor-acceptor distances (Rc) could not be approximated with simple linear nor parabolic functions in most ET donors, which are ascribed to the relatively greater values of the NetES in the dimers compared to the energy terms of the standard free energy gap (SFEG), solvent reorganization energy (SROE) and the electrostatic energy between the photo-products (ESDA) in total free energy gap (GT) in the ET rates.

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory eye care (PEC) program by comparing eye care knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP), as well as eye strain symptoms in staff computer users at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Thailand. Methods: A participatory approach was held by organizing a meeting of 26 stakeholders to get opinions for developing the PEC program. The developed PEC program consisted of 3-hour training course on eye strain, rest breaks for 30 seconds every 30 minutes of computer use, and 15-minute rest break (in the morning and the afternoon) with integrated eye–neck exercises. Then, a quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the PEC program. A total of 35 staff computer users enrolled in each of intervention and control groups for 8 weeks. Chi-square test and repeated measures analysis of variance were used for comparison of eye strain symptoms and the KAP scores. Results: The intervention was associated with reduction in percentage of eye strain. Significant differences were found between the intervention and the control groups at follow-up 1 (c2=18.529, p-value <0.001) and follow-up 2 (c2=18.651, p-value <0.001). The PEC program likely increased the beneficial effect on KAP scores between the groups and between times (p<0.05).

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 478 participants aged 18-65years residing in Ikolomani Sub-county, Kakamega County was conducted in April 2015. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We defined current drinkers as participants who consumed any alcoholic product in the preceding one month, and hazardous/high-risk drinkers as participants with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 and above. We summarised data using descriptive statistics and used logistic regression to explore for the correlates of each of current alcohol consumption and hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. Results: The sex-standardized prevalence of current alcohol drinkers was 31.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.8%-37.2%). The prevalence was higher in men (54.6%) than in women (8.9%). The mean AUDIT score among current drinkers was 16.9 (SD 8.2) and the sex-standardized prevalence of hazardous/high-risk alcohol drinking was 28.7% (95% CI: 24.1%-34.0%). Traditional brews were the most commonly consumed types of alcohol and most drinkers took alcohol in the homes of alcohol sellers/brewers. In multivariate analyses, the number of drinkers in the family, the number of friends who are drinkers and the attitude towards alcohol intake were positively associated with current alcohol drinking status, and with hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. Women were less likely to be current drinkers and hazardous/high-risk drinkers than were men. Other socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in the study area was higher than the national level estimate of 13.3%. The results suggest that the social environment is the main determinant of alcohol consumption in this setting. These findings imply that interventions to mitigate alcohol consumption in this area will have to target the social networks of the alcohol consumers, change the drinkers' attitude towards alcohol, and tackle the issue of availability of unlicensed homemade brews. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85014088197,"A search for narrow resonances in dielectron and dimuon invariant mass spectra has been performed using data obtained from proton–proton collisions at s=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector. The integrated luminosity for the dielectron sample is 2.7 fb−1 and for the dimuon sample 2.9 fb−1. The sensitivity of the search is increased by combining these data with a previously analyzed set of data obtained at s=8 TeV and corresponding to a luminosity of 20 fb−1. No evidence for non-standard-model physics is found, either in the 13 TeV data set alone, or in the combined data set. Upper limits on the product of production cross section and branching fraction have also been calculated in a model-independent manner to enable interpretation in models predicting a narrow dielectron or dimuon resonance structure. Limits are set on the masses of hypothetical particles that could appear in new-physics scenarios. For the ZSSM ′ particle, which arises in the sequential standard model, and for the superstring inspired Zψ ′ particle, 95% confidence level lower mass limits for the combined data sets and combined channels are found to be 3.37 and 2.82 TeV, respectively. The corresponding limits for the lightest Kaluza–Klein graviton arising in the Randall–Sundrum model of extra dimensions with coupling parameters 0.01 and 0.10 are 1.46 and 3.11 TeV, respectively. These results significantly exceed the limits based on the 8 TeV LHC data. © 2017 The Author"
2-s2.0-85014119789,"Measurements of strange hadron (KS 0, Λ+Λ‾, and Ξ−+Ξ‾+) transverse momentum spectra in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions are presented over a wide range of rapidity and event charged-particle multiplicity. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at s=7TeV, pPb collisions at sNN=5.02TeV, and PbPb collisions at sNN=2.76TeV. The average transverse kinetic energy is found to increase with multiplicity, at a faster rate for heavier strange particle species in all systems. At similar multiplicities, the difference in average transverse kinetic energy between different particle species is observed to be larger for pp and pPb events than for PbPb events. In pPb collisions, the average transverse kinetic energy is found to be slightly larger in the Pb-going direction than in the p-going direction for events with large multiplicity. The spectra are compared to models motivated by hydrodynamics. © 2017 The Author(s)"
2-s2.0-85014010459,"A search for heavy resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a vector boson is presented. The analysis is performed using data samples collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.2–2.5 fb−1. The search is performed in channels in which the vector boson decays into leptonic final states (Z→νν, W→ℓν, and Z→ℓℓ, with ℓ=e,μ), while the Higgs boson decays to collimated b quark pairs detected as a single massive jet. The discriminating power of a jet mass requirement and a b jet tagging algorithm are exploited to suppress the standard model backgrounds. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the background expectation. In the context of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet, a resonance with mass less than 2 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of limits on the parameters of the model, improving on the reach of previous searches. © 2017 The Author"

2-s2.0-85010952378,"Two parthenolide derivatives (PDs) were synthesized by chemical modification of parthenolide with concentrated hydrochloric acid and to evaluate their cytotoxicity to Hep-G2 cells in terms of their active functional groups and polarity. The chemical structures of the PDs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution mass spectroscopy. Two PDs (PD1 and PD2) were fractionated by silica gel column chromatography with a Rf of 0.37 and 0.19, respectively, in a 1:1 (v/v) hexane: ethyl acetate mobile phase, indicating that PD1 was less polar than PD2. Compared to the parent parthenolide, both PD1 and PD2 had lost the active carbon-carbon double bond and epoxide functional groups, but retained the active 14-methyl and α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone groups. Although PD1 and PD2 possessed similar functional groups, they differed in their structural arrangement and consequentially their polarity. PD1 and PD2 exhibited an in vitro IC50 against the Hep-G2 cell line of 41.0 and 94.0 μg/ml, respectively, which was weaker than that for parthenolide (<1 μg/ml). Thus, the ranked polarity of PD2 > PD1 > parthenolide was inversely related to their cytotoxicity against the Hep-G2 cell line (parthenolide > PD1 > PD2). The obtained PDs may be potential novel anticancer substances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85019017161,"Background Whole breast irradiation is an essential treatment after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). However, there are some adverse effects from inhomogeneity and dose to adjacent normal tissues. Objective Aim of this study was to compare dosimetry among standard technique, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), and advanced techniques, electronic compensator (ECOMP), inverse intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Methods Whole breast irradiation treatment plans of patients who had underwent BCS and whole breast irradiation were re-planned with all four techniques. Clinical target volume was contoured according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group atlas for breast only in patients who had negative node or ductal carcinoma in situ and breast with chest wall for patients with positive node. Planning target volume was non-uniformly expanded. Dose prescription was 50 Gy in 25 fractions with 6 MV photon energy. Results In total, 25 patients underwent whole breast irradiation with computed tomography simulation from November 2013 to November 2014 were included. Six patients with positive nodes were re-planned for breast with chest wall irradiation and 19 patients with negative nodes were re-planned for breast only irradiation. Primary outcome, radical dose homogeneity index (HI) of 3D-CRT, ECOMP, IMRT and VMAT were 0·865, 0·889, 0·890 and 0·866, respectively. ECOMP and IMRT showed significant higher HI than 3D-CRT (p-value<0·001). Secondary outcome, conformity index (CI) of advanced technique were significantly better than 3D-CRT. Lung V20, mean ipsilateral lung dose (MILD), mean heart dose (MHD), heart V25, heart V30 of advanced techniques were also lower than 3D-CRT. ECOMP had better mean lung dose (MLD), mean contralateral lung dose (MCLD) and mean contralateral breast dose (MCBD) when compared with 3D-CRT. Monitor units of advanced techniques were significantly higher than 3D-CRT. Conclusions HI of ECOMP and IMRT were significantly higher than 3D-CRT technique. All advanced techniques showed statistically better in CI. Lung V20, MILD, heart V25 and heart V30 of advanced techniques were lower than 3D-CRT. However, only ECOMP showed decreased MLD, MHD, MCLD and MCBD when compared with 3D-CRT. © Cambridge University Press 2017."
2-s2.0-85008319824,"Role of carbon-carbon double (CC) bonds content and their position in ethylene-propylene diene ter-polymer (EPDM), hydrogenated natural rubber (HNR) and natural rubber (NR) on in situ silica formation using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a silica precursor is comparatively investigated. Glass transition temperature (Tg) reflecting rubber chain flexibility is found as an important factor for in situ silica generation via swelling method. Despite of similar solubility parameters, NR has higher TEOS-swelling degree resulting in the higher in situ silica content (30.8 phr) than EPDM (3.50 phr) and HNR (10.4–17.6 phr) due to the higher Tg of EPDM and HNR providing the less chain flexibility to be swollen in TEOS solution. The morphological analysis implies that CC bonds in saturated rubbers may be agglomeration sites for in situ silica particles. For practical applications, saturated rubbers containing in situ silica/NR vulcanizates showed the improvement of mechanical properties and resistance of thermal and ozone degradation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2-s2.0-84982307013,"Thermal conversion of cassava rhizome was performed using a modular downdraft gasifier with the addition of Ni-based catalysts as promising tar eliminating and produced gas upgrading techniques. The activities of a synthesized 5% Ni/dolomite pellet catalyst prepared by impregnation method were investigated in a secondary reactor downstream of the gasifier. High reforming activity of the Ni/dolomite pellet catalyst on tar reduction was achieved. The conversion to H2 and CO was improved via steam reforming of methane and char reaction with CO2. Moreover, the formation of CH4 and CxHy was diminished through the tar or condensable hydrocarbon reformed on the catalyst surface. The carbon and hydrogen conversions of cassava rhizome with prepared catalyst were 83.79% and 61.78%, respectively, at an air flow rate of 1.98 m3/hr. At this condition, tar formation was low, while the lower heating value was 4.39 MJ/m3 and H2 to CO molar ratio was 1.22. Generally, the addition of a catalyst not only enhanced gas production, but also reduced tar and particulate matter generation; thus, its implementation should help lessen the pollution control requirement and cost of operation, while allowing higher quality fuel gas production. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85050039063,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine differences in patient and caregiver ratings of memory function in a community sample of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosed with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Methods: One hundred sixty-five patient-caregiver pairings participated in the study. Patients with PD were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests assessing five of the key cognitive domains as indicated in the PD-MCI Movement Disorders Task Force criteria. Patients and caregivers also completed the Memory Assessment Clinics Self-Rating or Family Scale (MAC-S/MAC-F), and patients were divided into two groups, those with PD-MCI and those without. Results: For patients diagnosed with PD-MCI, both patients and caregivers reported significantly more memory changes compared with patients without PD-MCI on the MAC-S and MAC-F. In contrast, for patients without PD-MCI, patients and caregivers differed significantly in their reporting of memory changes, with scores indicating that patients without PD-MCI felt their memory functioning was worse than what caregivers were reporting. Conclusions: Patients with PD without MCI might be more sensitive to memory changes than their caregivers. Whether the self-appraisal of memory problems is predictive of future cognitive difficulties, including progression to PD-MCI or PD dementia, should be the focus of future research. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society"

The study of context and community capital was conducted using in-depth interviews with 5 key informants obtained by the snowball technique. A transect walk and community mapping were also included. Information on ways to strengthen community capital was obtained using group discussion with purposively selected informants. A participatory process was used to encourage leaders, scholars, and members to explore and analyze the needs for enhancing the community’s existing capitalism in the field of local agricultural wisdom. Data analysis was conducted using a triangulation technique. The relationship and linkages between data groups were analyzed using contents analysis and interpretation. The results from the study showed that Ban Talingdaeng was an old community, situated along the banks of the KwaeYai River. Knowledge, cultural, and natural and environmental forms of capital were important in the village. Activities for strengthening community capital helped to support local agricultural wisdom. A network between school and community was set up using the agricultural areas of the community as a learning resource for youth. The research results revealed that the power of belief, the effective utilization and management of community capital, social network linkages, a positive attitude, team buddy focusing on participation, and the process of experimental learning and knowledge transfer were important factors for strengthening community capital. © 2017, Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute.

The results of data analysis were presented descriptively. It was found that with respect to context, most of the local shadow plays in Songkhla province were clustered in seven districts—Mueang Songkhla, Khuan Niang, Rattaphom, Bang Klam, Hat Yai, Na Mom, and Khlong Hoi Khong. There were two main types of performing styles: 1) that focusing on the performing purposes which could be divided into a master level or an ordinarily entertaining level and 2) that focusing on the quality of the performers which could be divided into high quality, popular, and general levels. Most of the play scripts were based either on the Ramayana, Thai fairy tales, or situational novels. The main characters were jokers and miscellaneous characters. The performance type could be categorized into a five-piece orchestra or a mixed orchestra.

A mixed-method approach—both quantitative and qualitative—was applied. Data were collected from 827 administrators and 168 schools using questionnaires and from 9 specialists using interviews. The research findings revealed that: The current state of school management to enhance a sustainable metropolis had an average score of 3.63, with the schools under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) having the highest average score (x = 3.69). The desirable state of school management to enhance a sustainable metropolis had an average score of 4.28, and the schools under the Office of Basic Education Commission (OBEC) had the highest average score (x = 4.44), indicating that both the current and desirable states of school management manifested operation at a high level. The three priority needs of school management to enhance a sustainable metropolis were: 1) school network, 2) learning places in the community, and 3) the operational process. The school management strategies to enhance a sustainable metropolis contained a set of three main strategies named “Strategies to unite the power for strengthening schools towards a sustainable metropolis” comprising: 1) strengthening management to develop students and staff to become engaged citizens of the metropolis, 2) enhancing the efficiency of school management based on the concept of economy, simplicity, and the most benefit towards development of a sustainable metropolis, and 3) developing a proactive synergetic local community, breaking new ground in learning places and honoring the culture of a sustainable metropolis. The conditions for implementing the above-mentioned strategies covered the following issues: 1) preparation of teachers and staff; 2) administrators as change agents; 3) school administration focusing on resource allocation and teacher development; 4) school environment; 5) well-prepared students, and 6) the availability of programs. © 2017, Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute.

2-s2.0-85027281959,"Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex interplay between peripheral and central inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Objective: To investigate immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways in relation to iron metabolism in peripheral blood of PD patients and healthy controls. Method: We recruited 56 healthy individuals and 56 PD patients in stages 1-3 of Hoehn and Yahr Scale. Plasma haptoglobin (Hp), homocysteine, interleukin 6, soluble interleukin 6 receptor, iron (Fe), ferritin, total iron binding capacity, transferrin (Tf), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), malondialdehyde (MDA) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) were measured. Results: PD was associated with significant changes in Tf (lowered), sTfR, ferritin, Hp, interleukin 6 and MDA (all increased) levels, while there was a trend towards a negative association with PON1. Logistic regression showed that the most significant biomarkers of PD were MDA, sTfR, Hp and ferritin. Moreover, Fe levels were negatively associated with Hp and positively with PON1, total iron binding capacity and Tf, while ferritin and sTfR were positively associated with MDA levels. Conclusion: Our study indicates a state of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in PD patients coupled with alterations in Fe metabolism. Chronic inflammation and oxidative pathways in PD may in part determine changes in iron metabolism. New drug treatments for PD should target inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways and iron metabolism as well. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."
2-s2.0-85027264257,"Objective and Background: To evaluate whether increased levels of high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) observed in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls (HCs) could be influenced by a previous exposure to early life stress (ELS) independently from other explanatory or background variables, including age, body mass index (BMI), and the presence of co-occurring mental disorders. Method: In this case-control study, we included 142 healthy controls and 92 bipolar I and II patients. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was administered in a subset of 30 female patients with BD and 31 female HCs, and plasma hs-CRP was measured in all subjects. Multivariable models adjusted the data for the possible confounding variables. Results: Serum hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with BD compared to HCs. However, after controlling for BMI, these differences were no longer significant. Around 55% of the variance in hs-CRP was explained by cumulative and independent effects of age, BMI and childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse. Conclusion: Our results show that increased hs-CRP levels in BD patients are more related to childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse, age and BMI than to a diagnosis of BD per se. These data suggest that peripheral inflammation may underpin the well-known detrimental effects of childhood maltreatment and obesity in the course of BD. Hs-CRP data are difficult to interpret if they are not adjusted for effects of BMI and age. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."

2-s2.0-85027261029,"Background: Evidence has implicated the translocation of commensal Gram-negative bacteria (Gram-B) due to leaky gut in the pathophysiology of depression and physio-somatic symptoms (e.g. fatigue, pain, irritable bowel syndrome, malaise, etc.). In addition, the leaky gut may contribute to immune-inflammatory activation and oxidative stress. This study investigated whether bacterial translocation is associated with perinatal depression and anxiety scores and with prenatal physio-somatic symptoms and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, including the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. Method: Data were collected in pregnant women at the end of term (T1) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (T2) as well as in non-pregnant controls. We examined the associations between serum IgM/IgA responses to Gram-B at the end of term and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -EPDS) and anxiety (Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory -STAI) symptoms. Results: Levels of C-reactive protein, zinc, haptoglobin, hematocrit and IgA/IgM responses to 9 TRY-CATs were also measured. No significant associations of the IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B with prenatal depression and anxiety were observed. Increased IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B predict higher levels of haptoglobin, hematocrit and TRYCATs, in particular quinolinic acid and the quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid ratio. IgA responses to Gram-B were significantly lowered in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, while IgM responses were significantly elevated in participants with alcohol consumption. Physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term were significantly associated with IgM responses to Klebsiella pneumonia. Postnatal anxiety was significantly predicted by IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translocation, while alcohol use may increase bacterial translocation. The results suggest that end of term mucosa-derived immune responses to Gram-B contribute to immune activation, physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term and postnatal anxiety. Highlights: • Immune responses to Gram - Bacteria associate with physio-somatic symptoms in pregnancy. • IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict anxiety symptoms after delivery. • Pregnancy may have a protective effect against bacterial translocation. • Alcohol use increases leaky gut and bacterial translocation. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."

In the screening phase, pooled sera collected from patients and healthy control in each group were separated by 2D-gel electrophoresis, analyzed for differentially expressed proteins and identified for biomarkers using LC/MS. In the verification phase, the protein candidates were selected for confirmation by western blotting. Results The analysis revealed 35 differentially expressed proteins. Three proteins including haptoglobin, gelsolin, and transthyretin, were selected for verification. The results showed that the levels of haptoglobin in both active and inactive AOID groups were significantly higher than that in the control group, while the levels of gelsolin in the active AOID group were significantly lower than that in the inactive AOID group. The level of transthyretin in the active AOID group was also significantly lower than that in the control group.

2-s2.0-85020118253,"The main purpose of this experiment is to study the effect of batch annealing atmospheres on oxide scales by annealing in air, hydrogen and nitrogen at 1123 K for 72, 90 and 108 ks. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were used to characterize oxide scales after batch annealing process. The morphology and oxide scale of the studied specimens were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscope. Result obtained by GIXRD showed Fe3O4 and spinel FeCr2O4 oxide scales on the as-received hot-rolled specimens. After batch annealing in air, Fe2O3 and (Fe,Cr)2O3 oxide scales were found. Whereas after batch annealing in hydrogen, Fe3O4 and spinel FeCr2O4 oxide scales were found. In addition, after batch annealing in nitrogen, Fe3O4, (Fe,Cr)2O3 and spinel FeCr2O4 oxide scales were seen. Oxide scales after batch annealing in air are thicker than the scales after batch annealing in hydrogen, however thinner than those scales after batch annealing in nitrogen. The oxide scales thickness after batch annealing in hydrogen is quite equivalent to that found in the as-received hot-rolled oxide scales. Cracks were observed perpendicular to the rolling direction. Weight change after batch annealing in air is higher than that after batch annealing in nitrogen and hydrogen, respectively. © Carl Hanser Verlag."
2-s2.0-85020418875,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of HPV 16/18 genotyping test, high risk HPV DNA testing, alone and in conjunction with the liquid-based cytology method in screening for cervical cancer precursors. Methods: A Markov model was used to describe the course of the cases of CIN2+ that had been detected over a 35 year period. Screening programs started at age 30 and were performed at an interval of once every five years. The model compared three strategies of HPV 16/18 genotyping with reflex cytology triage, high-risk HPV testing alone with referral to colposcopy and cytology-based screening with referral to colposcopy. We assumed the rate of patients lost to follow-up for those referred to colposcopy would be 0%. The clinical parameters were estimated using the data from a study conducted by the Thailand National Cancer Institute. Result: Of the three screening strategies evaluated, the high risk HPV DNA testing alone was the most effective for detecting CIN2+ over the 35 year study period. It detected 143 and 510 cases per 100,000 women more than the HPV 16/18 genotyping test and cytology-based strategy, respectively. The HPV genotyping test detected 368 cases per 100,000 women more than the cytology-based approach. In addition, when viewed with five year intervals, there were missed cases totaling approximately half of the detected cases screened by the cytology strategy and 10% of cases detected with screening by the HPV genotyping test. Conclusion: This study strongly indicates that HPV/DNA testing is preferable to cytology-based screening for cervical cancer precursors. However, the balance between the benefits, burdens and cost of each screening program should be considered."
2-s2.0-85019893268,"The high precipitation around Southeast Asia results in abundant freshwater outflow, which transports terrestrial dissolved and particulate material to the world's largest marginal sea, namely, the South China Sea (SCS). To estimate the riverine carbon flux to the SCS, carbonate data from 42 rivers were collected. These results, combined with literature data for 13 rivers, indicate that the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are positively correlated with the cation exchange capacity and the bulk density, except for the Low Discharge category. The highest DIC concentration and flux are in the Low and Medium Discharge categories. Negative correlations exist between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the base saturation in the Low and High Discharge categories and between DOC and bulk density in the Low and Medium Discharge categories. However, the correlation between the DOC concentration and the organic carbon content in the soil is only significant in the Medium Discharge category. Once the negative exponential relationships between the particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) or the particulate organic carbon (POC) and the total suspended matter are determined, these can be used to estimate the PIC and POC carbon fluxes. Of the annual riverine carbon flux, 83.0 ± 8.1 Tg C, 40.14 ± 6.11 Tg is DIC, 25.03 ± 4.54 Tg is DOC, 1.83 ± 0.35 Tg is PIC, and 16.03 ± 2.87 Tg is POC. The total discharge amounts to 6.2–10.3% of the global riverine discharge for a sea covering only 1% of the world's ocean surface area and for watersheds covering only 2.2% of the global land mass. ©2017.

2-s2.0-85019893177,"Food allergy results from failure in oral tolerance that usually occurs in infancy or early childhood. Exposure to peanut and hen's egg via the inflamed and disrupted epithelial barrier in children with severe atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for the development of allergy to these foods and supports the hypothesis that epicutaneous exposure in the absence of oral feeding is an important pathway of allergic IgE sensitization in infants. In recent years, the collective evidence has pointed toward the protective effect of an early feeding with peanut and egg in children with eczema, taking advantage of the pathways underlying oral tolerance to counteract epicutaneous exposure. An addendum to the NIAID food allergy guidelines recommends introduction of peanut into the diet of 4- to 6-month-old infants with severe eczema or egg allergy as an effective strategy to prevent peanut allergy. Strategies aimed at restoring the skin barrier are currently explored as an alternative approach of prevention of eczema and allergic sensitization. Manipulation of the diet via supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics to restore the healthy gut microbiota represents another potential pathway to induction of tolerance in the gut. Oral, epicutaneous, and sublingual routes of food immunotherapy are promising and induce desensitization in the majority of the treated subjects with food allergy but are not proven to restore permanent oral tolerance. Rigorous multicenter randomized clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the optimal timing, dose, duration, as well as the preventive and therapeutic effects of these diverse approaches. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-85019064508,"Isomaltulose, a naturally-occurring isomer of sucrose, is commonly used as an alternative sweetener in foods and beverages. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of isomaltulose together with green tea on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentration, as well as antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects. In a randomized, single-blind, crossover study, 15 healthy subjects (eight women and seven men, ages 23.5 ± 0.7 years, with body mass index of 22.6 ± 0.4 kg/m2) consumed five beverages: (1) 50 g sucrose in 400 mL water, (2) 50 g isomaltulose in 400 mL of water, (3) 400 mL of green tea, (4) 50 g sucrose in 400 mL of green tea, and (5) 50 g isomaltulose in 400 mL of green tea. Incremental area under postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were determined during 120 min of administration. Following the consumption of isomaltulose, the incremental 2-h area under the curve (AUC0-2 h) indicated a higher reduction of postprandial glucose (43.4%) and insulin concentration (42.0%) than the consumption of sucrose. The addition of green tea to isomaltulose produced a greater suppression of postprandial plasma glucose (20.9%) and insulin concentration (37.7%). In accordance with antioxidant capacity, consumption of sucrose (40.0%) and isomaltulose (28.7%) caused the reduction of green tea-induced postprandial increases in FRAP. A reduction in postprandial MDA after drinking green tea was attenuated when consumed with sucrose (34.7%) and isomaltulose (17.2%). In conclusion, green tea could enhance the reduction of postprandial glucose and insulin concentration when consumed with isomaltulose. In comparison with sucrose, isomaltulose demonstrated less alteration of plasma antioxidant capacity after being consumed with green tea. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85019988422,"A measurement of the top quark mass is reported in events containing a single top quark produced via the electroweak t channel. The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb- 1. Top quark candidates are reconstructed from their decay to a W boson and a b quark, with the W boson decaying leptonically to a muon and a neutrino. The final state signature and kinematic properties of single top quark events in the t channel are used to enhance the purity of the sample, suppressing the contribution from top quark pair production. A fit to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quark candidates yields a value of the top quark mass of 172.95±0.77(stat)-0.93+0.97(syst)GeV. This result is in agreement with the current world average, and represents the first measurement of the top quark mass in event topologies not dominated by top quark pair production, therefore contributing to future averages with partially uncorrelated systematic uncertainties and a largely uncorrelated statistical uncertainty. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."
2-s2.0-85018916942,"The objective of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of twenty-nine known isolated compounds from Cratoxylum species including three anthraquinones, four triterpenes, and twenty-two xanthones. All isolated compounds were subjected to antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Cytotoxicity evaluations were performed by MTT assay. The anti-oxidatant activity was performed using DPPH assay. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated from the production of cytokines TNF-α and IL1-β using ELISA assay. Human gingival fibroblasts and monocytes could tolerate both anthraquinones and triterpenes. All isolated anthraquinones showed moderate-to-high antibacterial efficacy while compound A3 also demonstrated moderate anti-inflammatory effect. None of the isolated triterpenes, except for T1, inhibited the expression of TNF-α. A number of isolated xanthones was toxic to HGFs and monocytes. Compound X5, X14 and a 1:1 mixture of X5 and X6 showed comparative anti-inflammatory activity to dexamethasone. Several triterpene and xanthone compounds also expressed antibacterial effect against P. gingivalis. Some isolated xanthones exerted anti-oxidant activity comparable to ascorbic acid. Accordingly, selected pure compounds from plants of Cratoxylum genus might be of benefit in developing medications that are important in treating periodontal diseases."

2-s2.0-85019027567,"Improved awareness of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has contributed to the overall decline in the HCV infection rate in some developing countries including Thailand. Chronic HCV infection in some rural Thai communities, however, presents a challenge in the efforts to treat and manage HCV-related diseases. Published and unpublished studies have suggested an unusually high incidence of HCV infection in a Thai province of Phetchabun compared to elsewhere in Thailand. To determine the magnitude of HCV infection and identify potential factors contributing to the higher rate of HCV infection in this province, we performed a population-based study in Phetchabun (n = 1667) and the neighboring Khon Kaen province (n = 1410) where HCV prevalence is much lower. Individuals between 30 and 64 years old completed detailed questionnaires designed to identify HCV risk factors and provided blood samples for anti-HCV antibody screening. The anti-HCV seropositive rates were 15.5% (259/1667) in Phetchabun and 3.6% (51/1410) in Khon Kaen. Positive samples were subsequently genotyped for HCV core gene sequence and assessed for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibody (HIV Ag/Ab). More individuals in Phetchabun possessed the combined presence of HBsAg (5.0%) and HIV Ag/Ab (0.4%) than those in Khon Kaen (3.9% HBsAg and 0.0% HIV Ag/Ab). While male gender, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and tattoos were significant HCV risk factors in both provinces (p <0.05), education less than high school and agriculturerelated occupation were additionally associated with HCV in Phetchabun. HCV genotypes 6, 3, and 1 were identified in similar frequency in both provinces. We estimated that prevalence of HCV seropositivity and viremic carriers were higher in Phetchabun (143 and 111 per 1000) than in Khon Kaen (34 and 22 per 1000). Finally, we derived a simple risk factorbased scoring system as a useful preclinical tool to screen individuals at risk of chronic HCV infection prior to intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will assist in HCV screening and promote access to anti-viral treatment in high-risk groups. © 2017 Wasitthankasem et al.

Several kinematic variables are employed to suppress the dominant background, multijet production, as well as to discriminate between other standard model and new physics processes. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of new-physics models that yield a stable weakly interacting massive particle. The number of observed candidate events is found to agree with the expected contributions from standard model processes, and the result is interpreted in the mass parameter space of fourteen simplified supersymmetric models that assume the pair production of gluinos or squarks and a range of decay modes. For models that assume gluino pair production, masses up to 1575 and 975GeV are excluded for gluinos and neutralinos, respectively.

2-s2.0-85018407395,"The Wingless/integrase-1 (Wnt) family of protein ligands and their functional antagonists, secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), regulate various biological processes ranging from embryonic development to immunity and inflammation. Wnt5a and sFRP5 comprise a typical ligand/antagonist pair, and the former molecule was recently detected at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level in human periodontitis. The main objective of this study was to investigate the interrelationship of expression of Wnt5a and sFRP5 in human periodontitis (as compared to health) and to determine their roles in inflammation and bone loss in an animal model. We detected both Wnt5a and sFRP5 mRNA in human gingiva, with Wnt5a dominating in diseased and sFRP5 in healthy tissue. Wnt5a and sFRP5 protein colocalized in the gingival epithelium, suggesting epithelial cell expression, which was confirmed in cultured human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs). The HGEC expression of Wnt5a and sFRP5 was differentially regulated by a proinflammatory stimulus (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] from Porphyromonas gingivalis) in a manner consistent with the clinical observations (i.e., LPS upregulated Wnt5a and downregulated sFRP5). In HGECs, exogenously added Wnt5a enhanced whereas sFRP5 inhibited LPS-induced inflammation, as monitored by interleukin 8 production. Consistent with this, local treatment with sFRP5 in mice subjected to ligature-induced periodontitis inhibited inflammation and bone loss, correlating with decreased numbers of osteoclasts in bone tissue sections. As in humans, mouse periodontitis was associated with high expression of Wnt5a and low expression of sFRP5, although this profile was reversed after treatment with sFRP5. In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel reciprocal relationship between sFRP5 and Wnt5a expression in periodontal health and disease, paving the way to clinical investigation of the possibility of using the Wnt5a/sFRP5 ratio as a periodontitis biomarker. Moreover, we showed that sFRP5 blocks experimental periodontal inflammation and bone loss, suggesting a promising platform for the development of a new host modulation therapy in periodontitis. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2017."
2-s2.0-85018430636,"In order to develop geomorphic criteria for distinguishing and locating abandoned channels and meandered belts, in this paper we examined geomorphologic characteristics from the Mun River, one of the main rivers in the Khorat Plateau, northeastern Thailand. Upstream of Mun River originated at southwestern rim of the Khorat Plateau where the river now cuts through sandstone basement. Meandering process shaped meander from upstream ending at low-lying plain about 30 km downstream from the Mun Bon Dam reservoir, and this process displays given values of geomorphic parameters including sinuosity index (SI), channel width (W) and radius of curvature (Rc). Sinuosity index was calculated to express the sinuosity of the channel. The relationship between W and Rc helps to predict channel stability and also comprehend the possibility of cutoff process. As a result, paleo- and recent flow directions of the Mun River are similar from southwest to northeast. Geomorphic parameters from eight river reaches have changed through time since 1974–2015. Two abandoned channel belts were identified, and they own an average channel width of 35 and 16 m, whereas the Mun River nowadays is of 12.7 m. SI values of two abandoned channel belts are categorized as meandering river system. Relationship between meander migration rate and bend curvature suggests that the Mun River possesses low erosion rate between 0.71 and 2.64 m/year since 1974 to the present. This rank of Rc/W ratio suggests stable state of river bank migration. Different migration indicates discontinuous meandering process from individual belt. Lateral migration rate was also decreased after Mun Bon Dam was constructed upstream. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Methods This study was conducted with 1156 adult outpatients continuously taking any medicines at least 3 months from three university hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand, between July 2014 and March 2015. The psychometric properties were assessed in five steps: 1) assessment of dimensional structure, 2) item selection, 3) assessment of practicality, 4) assessment of reliability, and 5) assessment of criterion and known-groups validity. Results The PROMPT-QOL contained 43 items including nine domains, and their five-point Likert scale functioning worked well. Most items fulfilled the item selection criteria. The PROMPT-QOL took an average administration time of 13.4 ± 5.8 minutes. Only two items had missing data of 0.1% to 0.2%. All domains provided good to excellent test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients between 0.67 and 0.83. All domains of the PROMPT-QOL yielded high Cronbach's α values between 0.77 and 0.89, greater than an acceptable level of 0.70, except for the Availability and Accessibility domain (0.58). A multiple regression showed that the Medication Effectiveness domain was the strongest predictor of the overall QOL of the PROMPT-QOL, followed by the Therapeutic Relationships, Psychological Impacts, Convenience, and Availability and Accessibility domains (adjusted R2 ~ 52%). As expected, patients with higher PROMPT-QOL domain scores were associated with being younger, more educated, having a lower number of medicines, patients’ perceptions of better disease control, having no adverse drug reactions, and medicine preference. Conclusions The PROMPT-QOL was practical, reliable, and valid for Thai patients. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85018796565,"Deposition patterns and density calculation of the copper (Cu) electroplating from CuSO4 solution onto stainless steel substrate were studied in order to gain better understanding of the relationship between correlated structures and their properties. Square non-porous stainless steel disks (316L SS), having a dimension of 1×1 cm, with a thickness of 1 mm, were used as the substrate. The electroplating system consisted of a Cu bar as the anode and 25 wt% CuSO4 plating solution. A potential of 2.0 volts was applied for the Cu plating at room temperature. The amount of the deposited Cu was determined by measurement of its weight increment. Layer thickness was obtained from the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrograph analysis. Density estimation of the deposited Cu was calculated from the mass difference and volume of plated layer, as described. Total Cu atoms using Faraday’s equation was used to obtain the theoretical density estimation. The density gradually decreased with the increasing thickness, suggesting that the Cu atoms deposited onto the growing nucleation were less packed at a longer period of plating time. Additionally, the rate of thickness increasing was higher over a longer time. It is believed that void formation was presented in the later state of the coagulation, in which complexity in nucleation growth occurred. © 2017, Walailak University. All right reserved."
2-s2.0-85018395798,"Background Endoglucanase plays a major role in initiating cellulose hydrolysis. Various wild-type strains were searched to produce this enzyme, but mostly low extracellular enzyme activities were obtained. To improve extracellular enzyme production for potential industrial applications, the endoglucanase gene of Bacillus subtilis M015, isolated from Thai higher termite, was expressed in a periplasmic-leaky Escherichia coli. Then, the crude recombinant endoglucanase (EglS) along with a commercial cellulase (Cel) was used for hydrolyzing celluloses and microbial hydrolysis using whole bacterial cells. Results E. coli Glu5 expressing endoglucanase at high levels was successfully constructed. It produced EglS (55 kDa) with extracellular activity of 18.56 U/mg total protein at optimal hydrolytic conditions (pH 4.8 and 50°C). EglS was highly stable (over 80% activity retained) at 40–50°C after 100 h. The addition of EglS significantly improved the initial sugar production rates of Cel on the hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose, and corncob about 5.2-, 1.7-, and 4.0-folds, respectively, compared to those with Cel alone. E. coli Glu5 could secrete EglS with high activity in the presence of glucose (1% w/v) and Tween 80 (5% w/v) with low glucose consumption. Microbial hydrolysis of CMC using E. coli Glu5 yielded 26 mg reducing sugar/g CMC at pH 7.0 and 37°C after 48 h. Conclusions The recombinant endoglucanase activity improved by 17 times compared with that of the native strain and could greatly enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of all studied celluloses when combined with a commercial cellulase. © 2017"

The combined effect of these vitamins and phytochemicals remains unknown, especially in the prevention of diabetes and its complications. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effect of ascorbic acid and gallic acid on fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidation. Results Ascorbic acid (15 μg/mL) and gallic acid (0.1 μg/mL) reduced fructose-induced formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in bovine serum albumin (BSA; 10 mg/mL) by 15.06% and 37.83%, respectively. The combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid demonstrated additive inhibition on the formation of AGEs after 2 weeks of incubation. In addition, synergistic inhibition on the formation of amyloid cross-β structure and protein carbonyl content in fructose-glycated BSA was observed. At the same concentration, the combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid produced a significant additive effect on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity.

2-s2.0-85018343418,"A novel selective agar (RGM medium) has been advocated for the isolation of rapidly growing mycobacteria from the sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The aim of this study was to compare RGM medium to Burkholderia cepacia selective agar (BCSA) and a standard acid-fast bacillus (AFB) culture method for the isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) from patients with CF. The applicability of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS) for the identification of NTM isolated on RGM medium was also assessed. Respiratory samples (n = 869) were collected from 487 CF patients and inoculated directly onto RGM medium and BCSA. Cultures were incubated at 30°C and examined for up to 28 days. A subset of 212 samples (from 172 patients) was also cultured by using a mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) and on Lowenstein- Jensen medium following dual decontamination. By using a combination of all methods, 98 mycobacteria were isolated from 869 samples (11.3%). The sensitivity of RGM medium (96.9%) was significantly higher than that of BCSA (35.7%) for the isolation of mycobacteria (P < 0.0001). The sensitivity of RGM medium was also superior to that of standard AFB culture for the isolation of mycobacteria (92.2% versus 47.1%; P < 0.0001). MALDI-TOF MS was effective for the identification of mycobacteria in RGM medium. RGM medium offers a simple and highly effective tool for the isolation of NTM from patients with CF. Extended incubation of RGM medium for 28 days facilitates the isolation of slow-growing species, including members of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAVC).

Physical and chemical properties were measured to evaluate any possible effect on quality. The best-fitted model for microbial inactivation by DMDC was a first-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.98). The rate constant was highest for E. coli O157:H7 (0.0437) and lowest for S. aureus (0.0152). An increasing in DMDC concentration resulted in a greater population reduction, with E. coli O157:H7 being the most sensitive pathogen. D values with 250 ppm DMDC added juices were slightly higher for Gram negative strains but slightly lower for Gram positive strains, when compared to their respective controls (no DMDC). There were no significant differences in pH, °Brix, total acid, total phenolic compound, flavonoid content, color values (L*, a*, b*) and color difference (▵E) between control and DMDC treated samples (P > 0.05). Results show that addition of DMDC can effectively aid in pathogen reduction which leads to a decrease in heating exposure of the fresh mandarin juice, possibly enhancing its quality. Practical applications: The addition of DMDC can effectively aid in the microbial reduction against target pathogenic microorganisms including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Therefore, DMDC can potentially be used as an additional treatment or in combination with other treatment to improve safety issue without significant effects on physical and chemical properties of fresh mandarin juice industry. Moreover, degradation kinetic studies showed that degradation of tested pathogen by DMDC followed first-order kinetic model and this can be applied for microbial population prediction after DMDC treatment resulting in an improvement the safety of consumers. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

From the morphology, when the amount of chemical blowing agent increases from 3 to 4 phr, the bubble size in the rubber matrix slightly decreases due to the increase of vulcanization reaction rate from the presence of amine fragment species as by-products from the decomposition of azodicarbonamide. The coalescence between bubbles is observed in the specimen with 5 and 6 phr of azodicarbonamide owing to high gas content in the rubber matrix. Moreover, the scorch time slightly reduces and cure rate increases as a function of azodicarbonamide content. The autocatalytic model can be used to explain the curing reaction and mechanism of this natural rubber foam. Furthermore, the activation energy (Ea) directly relates to the bubble size and microvoid structure of natural rubber foam. When compared with the vulcanized natural rubber without adding chemical blowing agent, it is found that the bulk density of natural rubber foam significantly decreases and the volumetric expansion ratio of natural rubber foam increases at high content of chemical blowing agent. Moreover, natural rubber foam at 4 phr of azodicarbonamide exhibits the lowest thermal expansion coefficient due to the smallest bubble size with less coalescence. © SAGE Publications."
2-s2.0-85018269665,"Considering photovoltaic inverters (PVs) as controllable VAr sources pave the way for an effective implementation of conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in distribution systems with multiple voltage regulating devices, this paper proposes some acceptable approximations to formulate a linear least-squares problem for optimizing a CVR implementation on the smart grid platform. The optimization problem is solved by using a built-in solver of the MATLAB software embedded in an iterative-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm is well verified by comparing its generated result with a trustful solution obtained from examining all possibly coordinating combinations of voltage regulating devices and PVs in the simplified Maehongson test system in Thailand. Effectiveness of the algorithm is also illustrated on that test system with a consideration of time-variant load and PV generation. All revealed features exhibit the high ability of applying the proposed method for implementing a closed-loop CVR functionality in distribution systems. © 2016 IEEE."
2-s2.0-85017002844,"Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that measured cytokine and chemokine levels in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to healthy controls (HCs). Method: The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched up until May 30, 2016. Effect sizes were estimated with random-effects models. Result: Eighty-two studies comprising 3212 participants with MDD and 2798 HCs met inclusion criteria. Peripheral levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-10, the soluble IL-2 receptor, C-C chemokine ligand 2, IL-13, IL-18, IL-12, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, and the soluble TNF receptor 2 were elevated in patients with MDD compared to HCs, whereas interferon-gamma levels were lower in MDD (Hedge's g = −0.477, P = 0.043). Levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-5, CCL-3, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were not significantly altered in individuals with MDD compared to HCs. Heterogeneity was large (I2: 51.6–97.7%), and sources of heterogeneity were explored (e.g., age, smoking status, and body mass index). Conclusion: Our results further characterize a cytokine/chemokine profile associated with MDD. Future studies are warranted to further elucidate sources of heterogeneity, as well as biosignature cytokines secreted by other immune cells. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-85016009856,"Introduction Hypoxia is a factor in controlling stem cell stemness. We investigated if cobalt chloride (CoCl2), a chemical agent that mimics hypoxia in vitro, affected human dental pulp cell (hDPC) stemness by examining cell proliferation, stem cell marker expression, and osteogenic differentiation. Methods hDPCs were cultured with or without 25 or 50 μmol/L CoCl2. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to determine cell proliferation. The number of STRO-1+ cells was determined by flow cytometry. The messenger RNA expression of the stem cell markers REX1, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG and the osteogenic-associated genes ALP, COLI, and RUNX2 were evaluated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or real-time polymerase chain reaction. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization assays. Results Although 25 and 50 μmol/L CoCl2 suppressed hDPC proliferation, 50 μmol/L CoCl2 increased the number of STRO-1+ cells. Moreover, CoCl2 dose dependently induced stem cell marker expression. Additionally, CoCl2 treatment suppressed osteogenic-associated gene expression, ALP activity, and calcium deposition. The addition of apigenin, a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor, reversed the inhibitory effect of CoCl2 on ALP activity. Conclusions This study indicated that CoCl2 may enhance hDPC stemness. © 2017 American Association of Endodontists"

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of preoperative radiation (dose > 50 Gy) with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by esophagectomy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: Data of patients with cT2-cT4 or node positive squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who received trimodality treatment between February 2006 and June 2015 were reviewed. Results: Forty-four patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy or three-dimensional radiation therapy. The median radiation dose was 60 Gy. The average volume of the lungs receiving 10 Gy was 48.1%, 20 Gy was 24.5%, and the average mean lung dose was 14 Gy. After chemoradiation, R0 resection was achieved in 31 patients (71%). Patients who received >60 Gy had a higher pathologic complete remission rate than those in the lower dose group (59.1% vs. 36.4%). R0 resection and radiation dose >60 Gy were associated with better overall survival in Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The median follow-up duration was 22.4 months and median survival was 25.6 months. Two-year overall, progression-free survival and locoregional control rates were 55.9%, 28.6%, and 56%, respectively. The most common grade 3–4 toxicities were esophagitis (63.6%) and neutropenia (25%). Grade 3–4 postoperative morbidities included surgical wound infection (2.3%), acute renal failure (2.3%), and anastomosis stricture (2.3%). Conclusion: Trimodality treatment with a high preoperative radiation dose and chemotherapy yielded a good pathologic complete response rate, and long-term survival with low toxicities. © 2017 The Authors.

Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala (CNP) berry fruit has been shown to possess powerful antioxidant properties. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of CNP extract against glutamate-mediated oxidative/ER stress-induced cell death in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. CNP extract was clarified for its radical scavenging activities, total phenolic and anthocyanin contents. The key anthocyanin cyanidin-3-glucoside was used as a marker to standardize the extract used in the study. We found that pretreated cells with CNP extract (0.05–1 μg/ml) prevented neuronal cell death in response to 5 mM glutamate evaluated by cell viability MTT, LDH and apoptosis/necrosis Annexin V/propidium iodide co-staining assays. For mechanistic approach, glutamate-induced cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated ER stress pathways, indicating the increase of ROS and ER stress signature molecules including calpain, caspases-12 and C/EBP homologous proteins (CHOP). CNP extract inhibited ROS production. Moreover, the extract also suppressed the specific-ER stress apoptotic proteins level in glutamate-induced cells by upregulating the gene expression of cellular antioxidant enzymes (SODs, CAT, GPx and GSTs). Taken together, our results provide information about and the molecular mechanism of CNP extract as a promising neuroprotectant and antioxidant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85013930490,"FGF9 has complex and important roles in skeletal development and repair. We have previously observed that Fgf9 expression in osteoblasts (OBs) is regulated by G protein signaling and therefore the present study was done to determine whether OB-derived FGF9 was important in skeletal homeostasis. To directly test this idea, we deleted functional expression of Fgf9 gene in OBs using a 2.3 kb collagen type I promoter-driven Cre transgenic mouse line (Fgf9OB −/−). Both Fgf9 knockout (Fgf9OB −/−) and the Fgf9 floxed littermates (Fgf9fl/fl) mice were fully backcrossed and maintained in an FBV/N background. Three month old Fgf9OB −/− mice displayed a significant decrease in cancellous bone and bone formation in the distal femur and a significant decrease in cortical thickness at the TFJ. Strikingly, female Fgf9OB −/− mice did not display altered bone mass. Continuous treatment of mouse BMSCs with exogenous FGF9 inhibited mouse BMSC mineralization while acute treatment increased the proliferation of progenitors, an effect requiring the activation of Akt1. Our results suggest that mature OBs are an important source of FGF9, positively regulating skeletal homeostasis in male mice. Osteoblast-derived FGF9 may serve a paracrine role to maintain the osteogenic progenitor cell population through activation of Akt signaling. © 2017"

The morphology of nanofibrillated cellulose present in fibrous network with 10–25 nm in diameter and micrometer scale in length and the chemical composition and crystal structure were maintained as cellulose type I. At 600 °C degradation temperature, the residue amount of the obtained nanocellulose was about 55% more that of CP, implying it had higher thermal stability. The used BMIMCl was recovered and reused at least 4 times. The nanocellulose obtained by using the recovered IL also demonstrated the same properties as those from the fresh one. For comparison, another kind of IL of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMOAc) was also used in this study.

2-s2.0-85013162277,"This study focused on rhizospheric yeast capable of degrading a priority pollutant, 4-nitroaniline (4-NA), under drought stress. Candida sp. AVGB4 (AVGB4) inhabiting in soil was isolated and characterized with plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits. 4-NA-dependent growth kinetic and biodegradation kinetics were analyzed and revealed 4-NA complete degradation and tolerance property. AVGB4 proliferation, PGP activities, and 4-NA degradation activity were well maintained under drought stress induced by PEG-6000 incorporation, and could be strengthened in the presence of succinate, an organic compound generally found in plant root exudates. The in vitro experiments proved that AVGB4 significantly enhanced plant growth and increased the shoot and root biomass of Vigna radiata plant in the absence or presence of 4-NA.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency of high-risk epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and the frequency of germline mutation in these patients. Methods: A total of 335 patients with histologically confirmed non-mucinous EOC were included. High-risk patients were defined as patients who had: (i) significant family history of breast/ovarian/colorectal/endometrial cancers; (ii) synchronous breast/endometrial/colorectal cancer; or (iii) high-grade serous carcinoma. Germline mutation was evaluated by Next Generation Sequencing system with the 27-genes panel. Results: A total of 94 patients (28.1%) were high-risk patients, 5.1% had significant family history of cancers, 4.2% had synchronous primary cancers, and 22.1% had high-grade serous carcinoma. Germline mutation was detected in 10 of 35 patients (28.6%). Six germline mutations (17.1%) occurred in homologous recombination (HR) genes; these included three (8.6%) in BRCA1, one (2.9%) in BRCA2, and two (5.7%) in other HR genes (CHEK2 and RAD1C). Three patients (8.6%) had MMR gene mutations (one MLH1 and two MSH2) and one patient (2.9%) had other gene mutation (MUTYH). Of the 10 patients with germline mutation, 40% of patients had no significant family history of cancer. Conclusion: Up to 30% of EOC patients had risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer. Germline mutation was identified in 28.6% of patients (11.4% BRCA mutation, 5.7% other HR genes mutation, 8.6% MMR mutation, and 2.9% mutation in other gene).

The amino acid was used as a building block for a new conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA with an oxetane-containing backbone. The unexpected sensitivity of the oxetane backbone posed considerable synthetic challenges under standard Fmoc-solid-phase peptide synthesis conditions, and a mechanism for acid-catalyzed degradation was proposed. In addition, the DNA- and RNA-binding properties of the oxetane PNA were investigated. The presence of an oxetane ring decreased the stability of the PNA⋅DNA and PNA⋅RNA duplexes when compared to PNA with a cyclobutane-containing backbone, which could be explained by the flattening of the oxetane ring, leading to a suboptimal torsional angle. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85011305866,"Purpose: Nasal naloxone is wanted for bystander administration in opioid overdose and as a needle-free alternative for emergency medical personnel. Epidemiologic studies have indicated a therapeutic effect of bystander administration of low-concentration/high-volume formulations. The objective for this study was to describe the nasal pharmacokinetics of a new high-concentration/low-volume nasal formulation of naloxone. Methods: This was an open, randomized triple crossover trial in healthy, human volunteers (n = 12) where two doses of nasal naloxone (0.8 and 1.6 mg) and one intravenous dose (1.0 mg) were compared. Fifteen serum samples were collected before and until 6 h after naloxone administration. Quantification of naloxone was performed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results: Bioavailability was 0.54 (0.45–0.63) for the 0.8 mg and 0.52 (0.37–0.67) for the 1.6 mg nasal naloxone formulation. Maximum concentration levels (Cmax) were 1.45 ng/ml (1.07–1.84) for 0.8 mg and 2.57 ng/ml (1.49–3.66) for the 1.6 mg. Time to maximum concentrations (Tmax) were reached at 17.9 min (11.4–24.5) and 18.6 min (14.4–22.9) for the 0.8 mg and the 1.6 mg doses, respectively. Conclusion: This nasal naloxone formulation had a rapid, systemic uptake and higher bioavailability than naloxone formulations not designed for IN use. This indicates that an optimized high-concentration/low-volume nasal spray formulation may deliver a therapeutic dose. The 1.6 mg nasal dose provided serum concentrations that surpassed those of 1.0 mg IV after 15–20 min and stayed above for the rest of the study period. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Cadmium was selected as there presentative heavy metal to investigate demolition waste adsorption capacity. The solid-liquid distribution coefficients (Kd) were observed. The adsorption isotherms were applied to investigate adsorption characteristics. Carbon content in the demolition waste materials was low and mainly in inorganic form. Cement paste and lightweight concrete had an alkaline pH with very high acid neutralising capacity (ANC). The surface area and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of these materials were low. Cement paste possessed the highest pH, ANC, CEC and surface area, with the highest Kd; however, its specific surface area and CEC were low compared to activated carbon and organic material. The adsorption isotherms indicated surface heterogeneity with favourable conditions for adsorption and the mean free energy suggested physisorption with multilayer formation. The Kd values of the tested materials were comparable to soil which was not effective in immobilising heavy metal via adsorption mechanisms. However, the high pH and ANC of cement paste and lightweight concrete can improve the heavy metal adsorption capacity of soil and soil ANC that help prevents and controls leaching by heavy metals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85010806735,"Macrophages are present throughout the anterior pituitary gland. However, the features and function of macrophages in the gland are poorly understood. Recent studies have indicated that there are two main macrophage classes: M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated). In this study, we examine whether both M1 and M2 macrophages are present in the anterior pituitary gland of rats. Our findings indicate that macrophages that are positive for CD68 (a pan-macrophage marker) were localized near capillaries in rat anterior pituitary gland. These macrophages were positive for iNOS or mannose receptor (MR), which are markers of M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively. To determine the morphological characteristics of M2 macrophages under pathological conditions, diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated rats were used as an animal model of prolactinoma. After 2 weeks of DES treatment, a number of MR-immunopositive cells were present in the gland. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that MR-immunopositive M2 macrophages had many small vesicles and moderately large vacuoles in cytoplasm. Phagosomes were sometimes present in cytoplasm. Interestingly, M2 macrophages in prolactinoma tissues did not usually exhibit distinct changes or differences during the normal, hyperplasia and adenoma stages. This study is the first to confirm that both M1 and M2 macrophages are present in the anterior pituitary gland of rats. Moreover, the number of M2 macrophages was greatly increased in rats with DES-induced prolactinoma.

2-s2.0-85010894783,"Hypercalcemia can cause renal dysfunction such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), but the mechanisms underlying hypercalcemia-induced NDI are not well understood. To elucidate the early molecular changes responsible for this disorder, we employed mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis of inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD) isolated from parathyroid hormone–treated rats at onset of hypercalcemia-induced NDI. Forty-one proteins, including the water channel aquaporin-2, exhibited significant changes in abundance, most of which were decreased. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that many of the downregulated proteins were associated with cytoskeletal protein binding, regulation of actin filament polymerization, and cell-cell junctions. Targeted LC-MS/MS and immunoblot studies confirmed the downregulation of 16 proteins identified in the initial proteomic analysis and in additional experiments using a vitamin D treatment model of hypercalcemia-induced NDI. Evaluation of transcript levels and estimated half-life of the downregulated proteins suggested enhanced protein degradation as the possible regulatory mechanism. Electron microscopy showed defective intercellular junctions and autophagy in the IMCD cells from both vitamin D– and parathyroid hormone–treated rats. A significant increase in the number of autophagosomes was confirmed by immunofluorescence labeling of LC3. Colocalization of LC3 and Lamp1 with aquaporin-2 and other downregulated proteins was found in both models. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed aquaporin-2 in autophagosomes in IMCD cells from both hypercalcemia models. Finally, parathyroid hormone withdrawal reversed the NDI phenotype, accompanied by termination of aquaporin-2 autophagic degradation and normalization of both nonphoshorylated and S256-phosphorylated aquaporin-2 levels. Thus, enhanced autophagic degradation of proteins plays an important role in the initial mechanism of hypercalcemic-induced NDI. © 2016 International Society of Nephrology"

Although several groups have reported butyrate production under oxygen-limited conditions by a native producer, Clostridium tyrobutylicum, and by a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli, efforts to produce butyrate under aerobic growth conditions have met limited success. Here, we constructed a novel butyrate synthetic pathway that functions under aerobic growth conditions in E. coli, by modifying the 1-butanol synthetic pathway reported previously. The pathway consists of phaA (acetyltransferase) and phaB (NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase) from Ralstonia eutropha, phaJ ((R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase) from Aeromonas caviae, ter (trans-enoyl-CoA reductase) from Treponema denticola, and endogenous thioesterase(s) of E. coli. To evaluate the potential of this pathway for butyrate production, culture conditions, including pH, oxygen supply, and concentration of inorganic nitrogen sources, were optimized in a mini-jar fermentor.

Punicalagin (PC) is a hydrolysable polyphenol derived from Punica granatum and a potent antioxidant. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of PC on glutamate-induced oxidative stress was evaluated in the mouse hippocampal cell line, HT22. PC treatment protected HT22 cells from glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, potentially attenuated glutamate-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restored the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Metabolic alterations after glutamate-induced oxidative stress and the protective effect of PC were evaluated with HPLC and GC-MS profiling methods with multivariate statistical analyses. Alterations in ten metabolites were identified, including amino acids, aspartic acid, asparagine, threonine, anserine, cysteine, tryptophan, lysine, as well as fatty acids palmitic acid, stearic acid, and palmitoleic acid. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed the involvement of multiple affected pathways, such as cysteine and methionine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate and fatty acid oxidation.

Gene expression was then investigated in primary canine chondrocytes. Our results showed that DHA and EPA as well as omega-3 sources could suppress matrix degradation in cytokine-induced cartilage explants by significantly reducing the increase of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (s-GAGs) and preserving uronic acid and hydroxyproline content (except GLM). These agents were not able to reduce IL-1β-induced IL1B and TNFA expression but were able to down-regulate the expression of the catabolic genes MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 and up-regulate the anabolic genes AGG and COL2A1; FO and KO were especially effective.

We mapped T. catappa trees and nut-cracking sites that we encountered along the intertidal zone and forest border on the coasts of Piak Nam Yai Island, Thailand. For each nut-cracking site, we measured the physical properties (i.e., size, weight, use-wear) of hammer stones and anvils. We found that T. catappa trees and nut-cracking sites primarily occurred on the western coast facing the open sea, and cracking sites clusters around the trees. We confirmed previous results that nut cracking tools are among the heaviest tools used by long-tailed macaques; however, we found our sample of T. catappa stone tools lighter than a previously collected sea almond sample that, unlike our sample, was collected immediately after use within the intertidal zone. The difference was likely the result of tidal influences on tool-use sites. We also found that tool accumulations above the intertidal region do not resemble those within them, possibly leading to incomplete assessments of macaque stone tools through archaeological techniques that would use these durable sites. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85006817947,"ECa 233, a standardized extract of Centella asiatica, has been found to exhibit various positive neurological effects and to have a good safety profile. The present study aimed to explore the disposition kinetics of ECa 233, containing madecassoside (53.1%) and asiaticoside (32.3%), in rats. The extract was intravenously or orally administered at doses from 50 to 200 mg/kg. Plasma, tissues, urine, and feces were collected at time points from 0 to 48 h after dosing. The levels of madecassoside and asiaticoside, as well as their postulated triterpenic metabolites, madecassic acid and asiatic acid, in biological samples, were simultaneously measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that all animals had a good tolerability for ECa 233, whereas madecassic and asiatic acids were found in negligible amounts after pharmacokinetic assessment. Madecassoside and asiaticoside demonstrated rather similar absorption and tissue distribution profiles. They were rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum levels within 5-15 min after oral administration, but they had poor oral bioavailability, less than 1%. Both triterpenoids were extensively distributed in the brain, stomach, and skin within 1 h and remained there for at least 4 h after dosing. Madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233 were mainly excreted as an unchanged form after being injected, and exclusively as triterpenic acid metabolites in feces after oral administration. The pharmacokinetic results obtained could provide some guidance for an appropriate dosing regimen of ECa 233 in future studies. This study also provided the first evidence demonstrating the presence of madecassoside and asiaticoside in their target tissues. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.New York."
2-s2.0-84995906304,"Human rhinovirus (RV) most often causes mild upper respiratory tract infection. Although RV is routinely isolated from the respiratory tract, few studies have examined RV in other types of clinical samples. The prevalence of RV was examined in 1,294 stool samples collected mostly from children with acute gastroenteritis residing in Bangkok and Khon Kaen province of Thailand between January 2010 and October 2014. In addition, 591 samples from hand–foot–mouth disease (HFMD) or herpangina patients who do not have gastroenteritis served as a comparison group. Samples were initially screened by semi-nested PCR for the RV 5′UTR through the VP2 capsid region. RV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the VP4/VP2 regions. Among children with acute gastroenteritis, RV was found in 2.3% (30/1,294) of stool samples, which comprised 47% (14/30) RV-A, 17% (5/30) RV-B, and 37% (11/30) RV-C. In the comparison group, 0.8% (5/591) was RV-positive and RV-C (3/5) was the major species found. Interestingly, RV was recovered more often from children with acute gastroenteritis than from those with HFMD or herpangina. As many as 31 RV types were present in the gastroenteritis stools, which were different than the types found in those with HFMD or herpangina. J. Med.

2-s2.0-84962013260,"There is some evidence that lowered tryptophan and an activated tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway play a role in depression, somatoform disorder, and postpartum blues. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between the TRYCAT pathway and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms. We examine the associations between end of term serum IgM and IgA responses to tryptophan and 9 TRYCATs in relation to zinc, C-reactive protein (CRP), and haptoglobin and prenatal physio-somatic (previously known as psychosomatic) symptoms (fatigue, back pain, muscle pain, dyspepsia, obstipation) and prenatal and postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms as measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We included pregnant females with (n = 24) and without depression (n = 25) and 24 non-pregnant females. There were no significant associations between the IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan and TRYCATs and prenatal and postnatal depression/anxiety symptoms, except for lowered IgA responses to anthranilic acid in prenatal depression. A large part of the variance in IgA responses to most TRYCATs was explained by PMS and haptoglobin (positively) and CRP (inversely) levels. The IgA responses to TRYCATs were significantly increased in PMS, in particular picolinic, anthranilic, xanthurenic and kynurenic acid, and 3OH-kynurenine. Variance (62.5%) in physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term was explained by PMS, previous depressions, zinc (inversely), CRP and haptoglobin (both positively), and the IgM responses to quinolinic acid (positively), anthranilic acid, and tryptophan (both negatively). The results suggest that mucosa-derived TRYCAT pathway activation is significantly associated with PMS, but not with perinatal depression/anxiety symptoms. Physio-somatic symptoms in pregnancy have an immune-inflammatory pathophysiology. Induction of the TRYCAT pathway appears to be more related to physio-somatic than to depression symptoms. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85010197129,"Objective To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case. Methods A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test. Results After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 ± 27.0 vs 144.9 ± 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 ± 957.12 vs $7508.60 ± 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups. Conclusion When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85000995879,"Objective: The purpose of this work was to compare fluoride release from three orthodontic adhesives and fluoride penetration into the enamel surface. Materials and methods: A total of 156 extracted human premolar teeth were randomly assigned to three experimental groups and one control group (without bonding) with 39 teeth per group. Brackets were bonded to teeth using Fuji Ortho LC®, Illuminate®, or Light Bond®. The amount of fluoride released (ppm) into artificial saliva was measured by a fluoride ion-selective electrode connected to an ion analyzer on days 1, 3, 7, and 30. Fluoride penetration was investigated after 1, 2, and 3 months; 13 teeth of each group were randomly selected at every period of study and sectioned across the center of the bracket. The surface of the cross-section was studied under the scanning electron microscope, and the fluoride concentration (weight%) at 1, 2, and 3 µm below the outer enamel surface was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Results: On days 1, 3, 7, and 30, the mean cumulative fluoride release from the three orthodontic adhesives were significantly different (p < 0.05). Illuminate® released the greatest fluoride, followed by Fuji Ortho LC® and Light Bond®. After 1, 2, and 3 months, fluoride penetration into enamel was only found from Fuji Ortho LC®. The fluoride concentration decreased with depth but there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) over time at all depths. Conclusions: The in vitro study indicated that fluoride release is a common property of the three fluoride-releasing orthodontic adhesives: Illuminate®, Fuji Ortho LC®, and Light Bond®. However, detectable fluoride penetration is a specific property of Fuji Ortho LC®. Further clinical studies should be undertaken to investigate the benefit of the two adhesives Illuminate® and Fuji Ortho LC® on protection of enamel demineralization. © 2016, Springer Medizin Verlag Berlin."
2-s2.0-85020541218,"Background: Previous studies showed that supplementation of reduced form of glutathione (GSH, 500 mg/d) has a skin-lightening efficacy in humans. This study was designed to evaluate the influences of both GSH and oxidized form (GSSG), at doses lower than 500 mg/d, on improving skin properties. Patients and methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, three-arm study was conducted. Healthy female subjects were equally randomized into three groups and took GSH (250 mg/d), GSSG (250 mg/d), or placebo orally for 12 weeks. At each visit at baseline and for 12 weeks, skin features including melanin index, wrinkles, and other relevant biophysical properties were measured. Blood samples were collected for safety monitoring. Results: In generalized estimating equation analyses, melanin index and ultraviolet spots of all sites including face and arm when given GSH and GSSG tended to be lower than placebo. At some sites evaluated, subjects who received GSH showed a significant reduction in wrinkles compared with those taking placebo. A tendency toward increased skin elasticity was observed in GSH and GSSG compared with placebo. There were no serious adverse effects throughout the study. Conclusion: We showed that oral glutathione, 250 mg/d, in both reduced and oxidized forms effectively influences skin properties. Overall, glutathione in both forms are well tolerated. © 2017 Weschawalit et al."

Sixteen dogs were inoculated each by oral administration of approximately 500 infective larvae of A. ceylanicum. Seventeen days after inoculation, the dogs were weighed and allocated randomly to be treated with afoxolaner plus milbemycin oxime chewable tablets or to remain untreated. Commercial chewable tablets of different strength were combined to deliver doses as close as possible to the minimum effective dose of 2.5 mg afoxolaner plus 0.5 mg milbemycin oxime per kg body weight. Parasites were recovered and counted for determination of efficacy seven days after treatment. All eight dogs that had been left untreated were harboring adult A. ceylanicum (geometric mean, 317.8; range, 210–428) while only one and nine A. ceylanicum were recovered from two of the eight dogs treated with afoxolaner plus milbemycin oxime chewable tablets (geometric mean, 0.5; p < 0.0001). Thus, 99.9% efficacy against induced infection of A. ceylanicum was obtained by the use of oral NexGard Spectra® at the minimum effective dose.

The factors chosen were the reaction temperature, copper content, Mg/(Ce + Mg) weight-percentage and steam to carbon ratios. The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and characterized by means of XRD, BET, H2-TPR, and FESEM. The Ce–Mg bi-promoter catalysts gave higher performance due to magnesium penetration into the cerium structure causing oxygen vacancy defects on the ceria. A response-surface-model was then designed to optimize the condition at a 95% confidence interval for complete methanol conversion to a high H2 yield with a low CO content, and revealed an optimal copper level of 46–50 wt%, Mg/(Ce + Mg) of 16.2–18.0%, temperature of 245–250 °C and S/C ratio of 1.74–1.80.

2-s2.0-84930716880,"Recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPET), obtained mainly from postconsumer bottles, was melt-mixed with either poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) or PBAT plus ultrafine wollastonite (∼5 μm) at different weight ratios on a twin-screw extruder and then injection-molded. Among the five rPET/PBAT blends (10–50 wt% PBAT) evaluated, the 80/20 wt% rPET/PBAT blend exhibited the highest tensile strength and degree of crystallinity, a slight increase in the tensile strain, and a remarkable increase in the melt flow index, but a lower tensile modulus and thermal stability with respect to the neat rPET. This blend was subsequently filled with four loading levels of wollastonite (10–40 wt%), where the tensile properties (modulus, strain at break, and strength) and thermal stability of the blend were all improved by the addition of wollastonite in a dose-dependent manner. Based on differential scanning calorimetry analysis, the crystallinity of rPET in the rPET/PBAT/wollastonite composites decreased in the presence of wollastonite, accompanied with a noticeable increase in the glass transition, cold crystallization, and crystallization temperatures, but only a slight change in the melting temperature was noted compared with those of the neat 80/20 wt% blend. Moreover, the addition of wollastonite at 30 wt% or higher showed a strong reduction in the melt dripping of the composites during combustion. J. VINYL ADDIT.

2-s2.0-85018358314,"Background: A protein that is expressed on capillary endothelial cells, called GPIHBP1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1), binds lipoprotein lipase and shuttles it to its site of action in the capillary lumen. A deficiency in GPIHBP1 prevents lipoprotein lipase from reaching the capillary lumen. Patients with GPIHBP1 deficiency have low plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase, impaired intravascular hydrolysis of triglycerides, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia). During the characterization of a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for GPIHBP1, we encountered two plasma samples (both from patients with chylomicronemia) that contained an interfering substance that made it impossible to measure GPIHBP1. That finding raised the possibility that those samples might contain GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. Methods: Using a combination of immunoassays, Western blot analyses, and immunocytochemical studies, we tested the two plasma samples (as well as samples from other patients with chylomicronemia) for the presence of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. We also tested the ability of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. Results: We identified GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in six patients with chylomicronemia and found that these autoantibodies blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. As in patients with GPIHBP1 deficiency, those with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies had low plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase. Three of the six patients had systemic lupus erythematosus. One of these patients who had GPIHBP1 autoantibodies delivered a baby with plasma containing maternal GPIHBP1 autoantibodies; the infant had severe but transient chylomicronemia. Two of the patients with chylomicronemia and GPIHBP1 autoantibodies had a response to treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Conclusions: In six patients with chylomicronemia, GPIHBP1 autoantibodies blocked the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind and transport lipoprotein lipase, thereby interfering with lipoprotein lipase-mediated processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and causing severe hypertriglyceridemia.

2-s2.0-85014564504,"It is known that in-vehicle carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration tends to increase due to occupant exhalation when the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) air is in recirculation mode. Field experiments were conducted to measure CO2 concentration during typical commute in Bangkok, Thailand. The measured concentrations agreed with the concentration predicted using first-order mass balance equation, in both recirculating and outside air modes. The long-term transient decay of the concentration when the vehicle was parked and the HVAC system was turned off was also studied. This decay was found to follow Fickian diffusion process. The paper also provides useful operational details of the automotive HVAC system and fresh air ventilation exchange between cabin interior and exterior. Implications: Drivers in tropical Asian countries typically use HVAC recirculation mode in their automobiles. This behavior leads to excessive buildup of cabin CO2 concentration levels. The paper describes the CO2 buildup in a typical commute in Bangkok, Thailand. Auto manufacturers can potentially take measures to alleviate such high concentration levels. The paper also discusses the diffusion of CO2 through the vehicle envelope, an area that has never been investigated before. © 2017 A&WMA."

The demographic structure of electrified households and the energy efficiency of electric appliances are considered as the dominant factors affecting electricity demand. Under the base-case scenario, the total electricity demand of Vientiane increased from 593 GWh in 2013 to 965 GWh in 2030. In the energy efficiency scenario, it is revealed that the appliance standard enhancement program can save total electricity demand in 2030 by 147 GWh (−15.2%), where 117 GWh (−12.1%) of which is contributed by the air conditioner and 30 GWh (−3.1%) by the lighting equipment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."
2-s2.0-85018508063,"Purpose: Of the 99% maternal deaths that take place in developing countries, one-fourth is due to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). PPH accounts for one-third of all blood transfusions in Bangladesh where the transfusion process is lengthy as most facilities do not have in-house blood bank facilities. In this context, the location where blood is obtained and the processes of obtaining blood products are not standardized, leading to preventable delays in collecting blood, when it is needed. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an online Blood Information Management Application (BIMA) system for reducing lag time in the blood transfusion process. Patients and methods: The study was conducted in a public medical college hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and in two proximate, licensed blood banks between January 2014 and March 2015, using a before after design. A total of 310 women (143 before and 177 after), who needed emergency blood transfusion during their perinatal period, as determined by a medical professional, were included in the study. A median linear regression model was employed to assess the adjusted effect of BIMA on transfusion time. Results: After the introduction of BIMA, the median duration between the identified need for blood and blood transfusion reduced from 152 to 122 minutes (P<0.05). For PPH specifically, the reduction was from 175 to 113 minutes (P<0.05). After introducing BIMA and after adjusting for criteria such as maternal age, education, parity, duty roster of providers, and reasons for blood transfusion, a 24 minute reduction in the time was observed between the identified need for blood and transfusion (P<0.001). Conclusion: BIMA was effective in reducing delays in blood transfusion for emergency obstetric patients. This pilot study suggests that implementing BIMA is one mechanism that has the potential to streamline blood transfusion systems in Bangladesh. © 2017 Rahman et al."
2-s2.0-85018565544,"Large ring cyclodextrins have become increasingly important for drug delivery applications. In this work, we have performed replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations using both implicit and explicit water solvation models to study the conformational diversity of iota-cyclodextrin containing 14 α-1,4 glycosidic linked d-glucopyranose units (CD14). The new quantifiable calculation methods are proposed to analyze the openness, bending, and twisted conformation of CD14 in terms of circularity, biplanar angle, and one-directional conformation (ODC). CD14 in GB implicit water model (Igb5) was found mostly in an opened conformation with average circularity of 0.39 ± 0.16 and a slight bend with average biplanar angle of 145.5 ± 16.0°. In contrast, CD14 in TIP3P explicit water solvation is significantly twisted with average circularity of 0.16 ± 0.10, while 29.1% are ODCs. In addition, classification of CD14 conformations using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) shows that 85.0% of all CD14 in implicit water at 300 K correspond to the elliptical conformation, in contrast to 82.3% in twisted form in explicit water. GMM clustering also reveals minority conformations of CD14 such as the 8-shape, boat-form, and twisted conformations.

2-s2.0-85017539149,"In this work, we studied the performance enhancement of organic thin-film solar cells (OSCs) originating from the presence of diffraction gratings on the surface of the active layer. Two types of diffraction gratings, periodic gratings (Blu-ray disc recordable: BD-R) and quasi-random gratings (Blu-ray disc: BD), were employed as master templates for grating structures. The grating structures were introduced to the surfaces of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) films, which were the active layers of the solar cells. The addition of the grating structures led to an increase of light absorption in the absorption region of P3HT:PCBM induced by light scattering. Furthermore, the grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance generated additional light absorption peaks. With illumination of non-polarized light at a normal incident angle, the short-circuit current densities of the BD-R and BD solar cells improved by 11.05% and 10.6%, respectively. Efficiency improvements of 19.28% and 3.21% were also observed for the BD-R and BD devices, respectively.

2-s2.0-85012285151,"Background Up-regulation of P-gp is an adaptive survival mechanism of cancer cells from chemotherapy. Three new phytochemicals including two benzophenones, guttiferone K (GK) and oblongifolin C (OC), and a xanthone, isojacaruebin (ISO), are potential anti-cancer agents. However, the capability of these compounds to increase multidrug-resistance (MDR) through P-gp up-regulation in cancer cells has not been reported. Purpose This study was to investigate the effects of GK, OC and ISO on P-gp up-regulation in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2 cells). In addition, the mechanisms underlying their inductive effect were also determined. Methods The inductive effect of GK, OC and ISO on P-gp expression at transcription level was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The reactive oxygen species production was determined by 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay. The protein content of P-gp and involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway was evaluated by western blot analysis. Results GK, OC and ISO (50 µM, 24 h) were able to increase the amount of MDR1 mRNA and protein in Caco-2 cells. The presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly prevented the inductive effect of GK, OC and ISO on MDR1 mRNA level. Moreover, MAPK inhibitors including U0126 (an ERK1/2/MAPK inhibitor) and SB202190 (p38/MAPK inhibitor) suppressed an increase of MDR1 mRNA levels in the cells treated with benzophenones (GK, OC) and xanthone ISO, respectively. These findings were in agreement with the increase of phosphorylated form of either ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) or p38 (p-p38) upon treatment of the cells with these three compounds. In addition, OC and ISO, but not GK, increased mRNA of c-Jun level. Conclusion The benzophenones GK, OC and xanthone ISO are likely MDR inducers through up-regulation of P-gp expression at transcription level. Their molecular mechanisms involve oxidative stress-mediated activation of MAPK signaling pathway. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH"

The double ratio of measured yields of prompt charmonia reconstructed through their decays into muon pairs, (Nψ(2S)/NJ/ψ)PbPb/(Nψ(2S)/NJ/ψ)pp, is determined as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charmonium transverse momentum pT, in two kinematic intervals: |y|<1.6 covering 6.5<pT<30 GeV/c and 1.6<|y|<2.4 covering 3<pT<30 GeV/c. The centrality-integrated double ratios are 0.36±0.08(stat)±0.05(syst) in the first interval and 0.24±0.22(stat)±0.09(syst) in the second. The double ratio is lower than unity in all the measured bins, suggesting that the ψ(2S) yield is more suppressed than the J/ψ yield in the explored phase space. © 2017 CERN."
2-s2.0-85018860581,"Background: There are inconsistent findings on associations between low-to-moderate level of arsenic in water and diabetes risk from previous epidemiological reports. In Ron Phibun subdistrict, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Thailand, a low level of arsenic exposure among population was observed and increased diabetes mellitus (DM) rate was identified. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between determinants (including low-level water arsenic exposure) of DM type 2 risk among residents of three villages of Ron Phibun subdistrict, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province. Materials and methods: Secondary data from two previous community based-studies, conducted in 2000 and 2008, were utilized. Data on independent variables relating to arsenic exposure and sociodemographic characteristics were taken from questionnaires and worksheets for health-risk screening. Water samples collected during household visit were sent for analysis of arsenic level at certified laboratories. Diabetes cases (N=185) were those who had been diagnosed with DM type 2. Two groups of controls, one unmatched to cases (n=200) and one pair matched on age and gender (n=200), were selected for analysis as unmatched and matched case–control studies, respectively. A multiple imputation technique was used to impute missing values of independent variables. Multivariable logistic regression models, with independent variables for arsenic exposure and sociodemographic characteristics, were constructed. The unmatched and matched data sets were analyzed using unconditional and conditional logistic analyses, respectively. Results: Older age, body mass index (BMI), having a history of illness in siblings and parents, and drinking were associated with increased DM type 2 risk. We found no convincing association between DM type 2 risk and water arsenic concentration in either study. Conclusion: We did not observe meaningful association between diabetes risk and the low-to-moderate arsenic levels observed in this study.

Such findings were proved in different lung cancer cell lines (H460, H23, and H292) and it was found that CSC markers (CD133 and ALDH1A1), stem cell-associated transcription factors (Oct4, Nanog, and Sox-2), and the ability to form tumor spheroid were dramatically suppressed by zinc treatments. Zinc was found to activate protein kinase C-α (PKCα) that further phosphorylated and mediated α-catenin degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Zinc was found to increase the β-catenin-ubiquitin complex, which can be inhibited by a specific PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I. Using specific reactive oxygen species detection and antioxidants, we have demonstrated that superoxide anions generated by zinc are a key upstream mechanism for PKCα activation leading to the subsequent suppression of stem cell features of lung cancer. Zinc increased cellular superoxide anions and the addition of superoxide anion scavenger prevented the activation of PKCα and β-catenin degradation. These findings indicate a novel role for zinc regulation in the PKCα/β-catenin pathway and explain an important mechanism for controlling of stem cell program in lung cancer cells. © 2017 the American Physiological Society."
2-s2.0-85008658156,"A new approach for modeling high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS)-type systems during the time-dependent capture and accumulation of magnetic particles by a ferromagnetic wire was developed. This new approach assumes the fluid (slurry) viscosity, comprised of water and magnetic particles, is a function of the magnetic particle concentration in the fluid, with imposed maxima on both the particle concentration and fluid viscosity to avoid unrealistic limits. In 2-D, the unsteady-state Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluid flow and the unsteady-state continuity equations applied separately to the water and magnetic particle phases in the slurry were solved simultaneously, along with the Laplace equations for the magnetic potential applied separately to the slurry and wire, to evaluate the velocities and concentrations around the wire in a narrow channel using COMSOL Multiphysics. The results from this model revealed very realistic magnetically attractive and repulsive zones forming in time around the wire. These collection zones formed their own impermeable viscous phase during accumulation that was also magnetic with its area and magnetism impacting locally both the fluid flow and magnetic fields around the wire. These collection zones increased with an increase in the applied magnetic field. For a given set of conditions, the capture ability peaked and then decreased to zero at infinite time during magnetic particle accumulation in the collection zones. Predictions of the collection efficiency from a steady-state, clean collector, trajectory model could not show this behavior; it also agreed only qualitatively with the dynamic model and then only at the early stages of collection and more so at a higher applied magnetic field. Also, the collection zones decreased in size when the accumulation regions included magnetic particle magnetization (realistic) compared to when they excluded it (unrealistic). Overall, this might be the first time a mathematical model was shown to be capable of realistically predicting the dynamic nature of magnetic particle capture and accumulation around a wire in HGMS-type systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85013378489,"An inclusive search is performed for supersymmetry in final states containing jets and an apparent imbalance in transverse momentum, p→T miss, due to the production of unobserved weakly interacting particles in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.5 fb−1. The dimensionless kinematic variable αT is used to discriminate between events with genuine p→T miss associated with unobserved particles and spurious values of p→T miss arising from jet energy mismeasurements. No excess of event yields above the expected standard model backgrounds is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of constraints on the parameter space of several simplified models of supersymmetry that assume the pair production of top squarks. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of top squark (t˜) decay modes, including the two-body decay t˜→cχ˜1°, where c is a charm quark and χ˜1° is the lightest neutralino, as well as the four-body decay t˜→bff¯′χ˜1°, where b is a bottom quark and f and f¯′ are fermions produced in the decay of an intermediate off-shell W boson. These modes dominate in scenarios in which the top squark and lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass. For these modes, top squarks with masses as large as 260 and 225 GeV are excluded, respectively, for the two- and four-body decays. © 2017 The Author"
2-s2.0-85017431873,"Dynamic PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) used in conjunction with tracer kinetic modeling enables the quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF). However, MBF maps computed using the traditional indirect method (i.e. post-reconstruction voxel-wise fitting of kinetic model to PET time-activity-curves-TACs) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Direct reconstruction of kinetic parameters from raw PET projection data has been shown to offer parametric images with higher SNR compared to the indirect method. The aim of this study was to extend and evaluate the performance of a direct parametric reconstruction method using in vivo dynamic PET MPI data for the purpose of quantifying MBF. Dynamic PET MPI studies were performed on two healthy pigs using a Siemens Biograph mMR scanner. List-mode PET data for each animal were acquired following a bolus injection of ∼7-8 mCi of 18F-flurpiridaz, a myocardial perfusion agent. Fully-3D dynamic PET sinograms were obtained by sorting the coincidence events into 16 temporal frames covering ∼5 min after radiotracer administration. Additionally, eight independent noise realizations of both scans - each containing 1/8th of the total number of events - were generated from the original list-mode data. Dynamic sinograms were then used to compute parametric maps using the conventional indirect method and the proposed direct method. For both methods, a one-tissue compartment model accounting for spillover from the left and right ventricle blood-pools was used to describe the kinetics of 18F-flurpiridaz. An image-derived arterial input function obtained from a TAC taken in the left ventricle cavity was used for tracer kinetic analysis. For the indirect method, frame-by-frame images were estimated using two fully-3D reconstruction techniques: the standard ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithm on one side, and the one-step late maximum a posteriori (OSL-MAP) algorithm on the other side, which incorporates a quadratic penalty function. The parametric images were then calculated using voxel-wise weighted least-square fitting of the reconstructed myocardial PET TACs. For the direct method, parametric images were estimated directly from the dynamic PET sinograms using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) parametric reconstruction algorithm which optimizes an objective function comprised of the Poisson log-likelihood term, the kinetic model and a quadratic penalty function. Maximization of the objective function with respect to each set of parameters was achieved using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm with a specifically developed pre-conditioner. The performance of the direct method was evaluated by comparing voxel- and segment-wise estimates of , the tracer transport rate (ml • min-1 • ml-1), to those obtained using the indirect method applied to both OSEM and OSL-MAP dynamic reconstructions. The proposed direct reconstruction method produced maps with visibly lower noise than the indirect method based on OSEM and OSL-MAP reconstructions. At normal count levels, the direct method was shown to outperform the indirect method based on OSL-MAP in the sense that at matched level of bias, reduced regional noise levels were obtained. At lower count levels, the direct method produced estimates with significantly lower standard deviation across noise realizations than the indirect method based on OSL-MAP at matched bias level. In all cases, the direct method yielded lower noise and standard deviation than the indirect method based on OSEM. Overall, the proposed direct reconstruction offered a better bias-variance tradeoff than the indirect method applied to either OSEM and OSL-MAP. Direct parametric reconstruction as applied to in vivo dynamic PET MPI data is therefore a promising method for producing MBF maps with lower variance. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine."
2-s2.0-85011688958,"A search for the resonant production of high-mass photon pairs is presented. The search focuses on spin-0 and spin-2 resonances with masses between 0.5 and 4.5 TeV, and with widths, relative to the mass, between 1.4×10−4 and 5.6×10−2. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb−1 of proton–proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess is observed relative to the standard model expectation. The results of the search are combined statistically with those previously obtained in 2012 and 2015 at s=8 and 13 TeV, respectively, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 3.3 fb−1, to derive exclusion limits on scalar resonances produced through gluon–gluon fusion, and on Randall–Sundrum gravitons. The lower mass limits for Randall–Sundrum gravitons range from 1.95 to 4.45 TeV for coupling parameters between 0.01 and 0.2. These are the most stringent limits on Randall–Sundrum graviton production to date. © 2017 The Author"
2-s2.0-85016629021,"In 1988, the generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic in Thailand began and in the same year the first HIV-exposed infant in Thailand was born at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok. From the early to mid-1990s, an epidemic wave of HIV-infected women and infants occurred. Heterosexual HIV transmission, as described in the Asian Epidemic Model, was the major mode of spread in Thailand, causing an increasing number of HIV-infected pregnant women. The early and concerted multi-sectoral response of Thai society reduced the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women from 2% in the mid-1990s to 0.6% in 2015 and mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) from an estimated 20–40% to 1.9%. Thus, Thailand became the first Asian country to achieve the World Health Organization’s (WHO) targets for the elimination of MTCT. In this narrative review, the key historic evolutions of the science and policy of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in Thailand that addressed the four prongs of the recommended WHO PMTCT strategy are described, and the lessons learned are discussed. © 2017 The Author(s).

2-s2.0-85017460322,"Diving-related tourism is known to contribute both directly and indirectly to reef degradation around the globe, including Koh Tao, a popular diving destination in the Gulf of Thailand. Of the known publications on reef threats at Koh Tao, only three mention the effects of highly abundant coral predators. The present study combines results of a nine-year long period (2006-2014) of reef surveys to evaluate the abundance and impact of corallivorous Drupella snails and Acanthaster sea stars in this area. It also provides the first record of their simultaneous outbreaks on Koh Tao’s reefs. The results are compared to those of other studies in order to evaluate how coral predation has influenced declines in reef health. The findings suggest that the combined effect of these corallivores has contributed substantially to coral degradation over the last decade and indicate that future assessments of reef decline in areas impacted by heavy tourism also need to address the effect of coral predation. © National University of Singapore."

A prospective cohort study was conducted. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography cervical length assessments were performed in 160 pregnant women between 16 and 23 + 6 weeks of gestation. Transabdominal ultrasonography cervical length assessment was positively correlated with the transvaginal ultrasonography cervical length assessment. Mean ± standard deviation of the cervical length was significantly different between transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography (36.4 ± 5.4 vs. 41.2 ± 5.4 mm, p <.001). Transabdominal cervical length was shorter than the transvaginal cervical length with a mean difference of 4.8 mm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for predicting preterm birth when the transabdominal cervical length was ≤35 mm, were 50%, 52.1%, 9.1%, and 91.6%, respectively. In conclusion, transabdominal ultrasonography cervical length assessment is positively correlated with the transvaginal ultrasonography cervical length assessment. Transabdominal cervical length assessment was not a good predictor of preterm birth. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85019699633,"Boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have exemplary electrochemical properties; however, widespread use of high-quality BDD has previously been limited by material cost and availability. In the present article, we report the use of a BDD paste electrode (BDDPE) coupled with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) to create a low-cost, high-performance electrochemical sensor. The BDDPEs are easy to prepare from a mixture of BDD powder and mineral oil and can be easily stencil-printed into a variety of electrode geometries. We demonstrate the utility and applicability of BDDPEs through measurements of biological species (norepinephrine and serotonin) and heavy metals (Pb and Cd) using μPADs. Compared to traditional carbon paste electrodes (CPE), BDDPEs exhibit a wider potential window, lower capacitive current, and are able to circumvent the fouling of serotonin. These results demonstrate the capability of BDDPEs as point-of-care sensors when coupled with μPADs. © 2017 American Chemical Society."

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (control; n = 6) was given distilled water (DW). Group 2 (IMN; n = 6) was given indomethacin (IMN) 150 mg/kg dissolved in 5% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3-) 1 mL/rat via intragastric tube at time 0 and 4 h. Group 3 (genistein; n = 6) was given genistein 100 mg/kg dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus IMN 150 mg/kg at time described as group 2. Four hours after the second dose, the stomach was removed to examine iNOS western blot expression, malondialdehyde (MDA), and histopathologic examination. Serum was collected to determine TNF-alpha and prostaglandin E2(PGE2) levels using ELISA technique. Results: Tissue MDA and serum TNF-alpha were significantly increased in the IMN group, as compared to the control group (9.70 ± 0.40 vs. 1.56 ± 0.14 nmol/mg protein, P = 0.000; 210.28 ± 0.98 vs. 126.4 ± 0.13 pg/mL, P = 0.000, respectively) and decreased in the genistein group when compared to the IMN group (2.87 ± 0.37 vs. 9.70 ± 0.40 nmol/mg protein, P = 0.000; 156.59 ± 0.10 vs. 210.28 ± 0.98 pg/mL, P = 0.000, respectively). Serum PGE2level in IMN group was decreased significantly compared with control group (152.83 ± 0.10 vs. 303.33 ± 2.16 pg/mL, P = 0.000) and increased in the genistein group compared to the IMN group (247.65 ± 0.01 vs. 152.83 ± 0.10 pg/mL, P = 0.000). Expression of tissue iNOS was increased in the IMN group and improved in genistein groups. Most of the rats in the IMN group developed moderate to severe gastric erosion and ulcers.

Compared to temperate zones, baseline information on Campylobacter in tropical regions is limited. Thus, the objectives of the present study were 1) to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in Thai broiler flocks and 2) to investigate the association between climatic factors (i.e., rainfall, ambient temperature, and relative humidity) and Campylobacter colonization status of broiler flocks in Thailand. A total of 442 commercial broiler flocks reared in the central and northeastern regions of Thailand during 2012 to 2014 were investigated. Campylobacter positive status was identified in 252 examined flocks (57.01%; 95% CI 52.39 to 61.63%). Prevalence of Campylobacter in the northeastern region (54.46%; 95% CI 44.76 to 63.83%) was slightly lower than that of the central region (57.77%; 95% CI 52.47 to 62.90%). More than 65% of Campylobacter positive flocks in the central and northeastern regions had within-flock prevalence higher than 75%.

It has been link to a variety of negative consequences that effect education, social interaction and health. Hence, this study aimed to explore game addiction situation and pattern of game playing among elementary school students. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March, 2015 among 295 grade 4-5 students from elementary schools in Bangkok, Thailand. The participants were recruited through a simple random sampling technique. A self-administrated questionnaires under explanation of researchers were used. The questions included following 1) Students characteristics and parents characteristics 2) game consisted of patterns of game playing and game addiction screening test (GAST). Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. Results: Almost students were played game (98%). The prevalence of game addiction based on the GAST score was 7.5%, both boys and girls were similar (7.7%, 7.2%), follow by almost twenty percent were obsesses group (16.6%) while the mass group were normal group (75.9%).The majority usually played online game (62.7%). Most of participants had devices at home (93.6%) and also played game at home(93.6%). More than half (63.4%) used devices in the living room. Among students who play game found that games they usually play were line game (37.7).

2-s2.0-85018714087,"Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder of skin pigmentation associated with mutations in keratin 5 (KRT5), protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), or protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1). Here, we have identified 6 heterozygous truncating mutations in PSENEN, encoding presenilin enhancer protein 2, in 6 unrelated patients and families with DDD in whom mutations in KRT5, POFUT1, and POGLUT1 have been excluded. Further examination revealed that the histopathologic feature of follicular hyperkeratosis distinguished these 6 patients from previously studied individuals with DDD. Knockdown of psenen in zebrafish larvae resulted in a phenotype with scattered pigmentation that mimicked human DDD. In the developing zebrafish larvae, in vivo monitoring of pigment cells suggested that disturbances in melanocyte migration and differentiation underlie the DDD pathogenesis associated with PSENEN. Six of the PSENEN mutation carriers presented with comorbid acne inversa (AI), an inflammatory hair follicle disorder, and had a history of nicotine abuse and/or obesity, which are known trigger factors for AI. Previously, PSENEN mutations were identified in familial AI, and comanifestation of DDD and AI has been reported for decades. The present work suggests that PSENEN mutations can indeed cause a comanifestation of DDD and AI that is likely triggered by predisposing factors for AI. Thus, the present report describes a DDD subphenotype in PSENEN mutation carriers that is associated with increased susceptibility to AI."
2-s2.0-85024109215,"This paper proposes an approach for a robust tracking method to the objects intersection with appearances similar to a target object. The target is image sequences taken by a moving camera in this paper. Tracking methods using color information tend to track mistakenly a background region or an object with color similar to the target object since the proposed method is based on the particle filter. The method constructs the probabilistic background model by the histogram of the optical flow and defines the likelihood function so that the likelihood in the region of the target object may become large. This leads to increasing the accuracy of tracking. The probabilistic background model is made by the density forests. It can infer a probabilistic density fast. The proposed method can process faster than the authors' previous approach by introducing the density forests. Results are demonstrated by experiments using the real videos of outdoor scenes.

2-s2.0-85020486096,"This study aimed to optimize the condition of silica-supported nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI/SiO2) synthesis by colloidal impregnation method. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used as a tool to create and analyze the 17 synthesized conditions of NZVI/SiO2 samples. The independent variables included ethanol concentration (0-100 vol%), amount of silica (0.025-0.125 g) and agitation speed (100-400 rpm). In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a response surface quadratic model was used to approximate statistical relationship of independent variables. The reducing performance of the synthesized NZVI/SiO2 was examined through removal of Cr(VI) contaminated in water. The optimum of NZVI/SiO2 synthesis was validated with 100 vol% of ethanol concentration, 0.075 g of silica amount, and 100 rpm of agitation speed. The materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption which showed the existence of NZVI phase, composition, and morphology. The Cr(VI) removal efficiency of the NZVI/SiO2 was tested further at the solution pH 4, 7 and 10 in comparison with that by pristine NZVI and silica-unsupported NZVI (NZVI + SiO2). Among the three materials, NZVI/SiO2 presented the highest Cr(VI) removal, especially at pH 7 and 10 with 98 and 94.41%, within 60 min. This was due to the adsorption of Cr(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 precipitates over SiO2 resulting in availibilty of NZVI/SiO2?s active sites. The proposed mechanism of Cr(VI) removal by NZVI/SiO2 was also described."

2-s2.0-85021728716,"This study investigated the differential expression of genes associated with reproduction in sterile triploid and normal diploid bighead catfish (Clarias macrocephalus Günther, 1864). The triploid fish were produced using cold shock and were reared in the same conditions as the diploid counterpart. The histomicrographs showed completely retarded triploid gonads across the samples aged 2–12 mth, whereas the gonads of the diploids were in developing stages during 2–4 mth, reached the early maturing stage at 6 mth, matured at 8 mth and showed signs of atresia at 10–12 mth. In parallel, the full-length cDNAs of cyclin B1 (CmCcnb1; 1539 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1194 bp corresponding to 397 amino acids) and cell division cycle 2 (CmCdc2; 1355 bp, an ORF of 909 bp, 302 amino acids) of bighead catfish (C. macrocephalus Günther, 1864) were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the newly characterized CmCcnb1 should be regarded as a member of cyclin B1 rather than cyclin B2. The expression level of CmCcnb1 mRNA was limited in different stages of the ovaries and testes of triploids. In diploid ovaries, its expression was significantly higher than that in triploid ovaries in fish aged 2 mth (513.43 ± 82.22 fold) and in fish aged 8 mth (2430.87 ± 900.06 fold). The CmCcnb1 level in the testes of diploids was significantly greater than that in triploids in fish aged 2 mth (928.85 ± 208.72 fold). Similarly, expression of CmCdc2 mRNA was also reduced in triploids. Its expression was significantly lower than that in diploid females aged 2 mth (7.66 ± 3.42 fold), 4 mth (59.42 ± 10.50 fold) and 8 mth (42.74 ± 8.36 fold). In males, significantly greater expression of CmCdc2 was observed at age 6 mth (58.61 ± 34.64 fold) and 8 mth (72.70 ± 4.36 fold) diploids compared to triploids.

Expression of the full-length OsNUC1 gene in Arabidopsis resulted in hypersensitivity to ABA during germination. Transcriptome analysis of the transgenic lines, in comparison with the wild type, revealed that the RNA abundance of >1,900 genes was significantly changed under normal growth conditions, while under salt stress conditions the RNAs of 999 genes were found to be significantly regulated. Gene enrichment analysis showed that under normal conditions OsNUC1 resulted in repression of genes involved in photosynthesis, while in salt stress conditions OsNUC1 increased expression of the genes involved in the light-harvesting complex. Correspondingly, the net rate of photosynthesis of the transgenic lines was increased under salt stress. Transgenic rice lines with overexpression of the OsNUC1-L gene were generated and tested for photosynthetic performance under salt stress conditions. The transgenic rice lines treated with salt stress at the booting stage had a higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance in flag leaves and second leaves than the wild type. Moreover, higher contents of Chl a and carotenoids were found in flag leaves of the transgenic rice. These results suggest a role for OsNUC1 in the modification of the transcriptome, especially the gene transcripts responsible for photosynthesis, leading to stabilization of photosynthesis under salt stress conditions. © The Author 2017.

Methods: Nineteen patients were retrospectively reviewed of laparoscopic adrenalectomy, preoperatively diagnosed to be Pheochromocytoma (PCC), underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy using LigaSure instead of vascular clip or suturing. We reported intraoperative findings, conversion rates, blood loss, operative time, morbidity and postoperative outcomes. Results: Eighteen patients were performed successfully. One patients was converted to open adrenalectomy because of surrounding tissue invasion. No mortality or major morbidity was observed. Estimated blood loss was 153 ml (excluding the converted open adrenalectomy patient). The pathological results showed 6 patients of potentially malignant PCC (PASS score ≥ 4). Conclusions: The LigaSure device appears to be safe and effective in laparoscopic adrenalectomy for PCC. The clip less approach can be used with acceptable outcomes. © 2017, Asian Biomedicine.

For models describing the pair production of the lightest chargino, exclusion regions are obtained in the plane of chargino mass vs. neutralino mass under the following assumptions: the chargino decays into third-generation sleptons, which are taken to be the lightest sleptons, and the sleptons masses lie midway between those of the chargino and the neutralino. Chargino masses below 420 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level in the limit of a massless neutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the cross section for pair production of τ sleptons as a function of mass, assuming a massless neutralino.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85019567707,"Background: Growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) or Laron syndrome can result from GH receptor (GHR) or postreceptor defects, such as in GH binding or transduction, or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis. Multiple defects in GHI have been reported in cohorts from the Middle East, Ecuador, and the Mediterranean, but rarely reported from Southeast Asia. Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of young Thai sisters with severe short stature. Coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the GHR were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, and products were purified and sequenced. Serum GH, IGF-1, and IGF binding protein-3 were assayed immunometrically. Results: We found an extreme GHI phenotype and a homozygous mutation in exon 7 of GHR. Conclusions: This mutation can cause a new donor splice site and interfere with mRNA splicing. To our knowledge, these are first cases of Laron syndrome in Thais confirmed by genotyping. © 2017, Asian Biomedicine. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85019270813,"Background: An extensive full-thickness wound need a graft, sometime very large. However, donor sites are often limited. Dermal substitutes are among the tissue-engineered products applied to clinical use. PoreSkin, a human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) manufactured by the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, is the first human dermal substitute developed in Thailand. Objective: Assess the safety and ability in achieving durable and definitively cosmetic coverage using PoreSkin. Material and Method: Eleven hypertrophic burn scars were enrolled in the present study. After scar excision, PoreSkin was placed followed by delayed split-thickness skin graft, three weeks later. The primary outcomes were the engraftment rate of the Poreskin and the skin graft. The secondary outcomes included complications and the final cosmetic appearance. Results: The engraftment rate of PoreSkin was 97.7% at day 21. The engraftment rate of autologous sheet skin graft placed over PoreSkin was 91.8%. Regarding the quality of the scar, using the Vancouver scar scale, it shows a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05). No major complications or rejection were observed. Conclusion: The performance of PoreSkin as a human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) is comparable to other commercial dermal substitutes in term of engraftment rate, complications, and rejection. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

2-s2.0-85019263195,"Objective: To develop a reliable and valid treatment outcome checklist for the measurement of ADHD treatment for children in a clinical setting. Material and Method: The behavior indicators to assess the treatment outcomes of ADHD children were researched and developed by using multi-informants perspectives. The present study involved a qualitative study and two rounds of the Modified Delphi Techniques. In the first process, 11 parents/guardians of ADHD children aged 6 to 18 years were given a semi-structured interview on their expectation towards treatment outcomes at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Rajanagarindra Institute. Items from literature reviews were also added before the first and second round evaluations using the Delphi by five different expert fields (six experts from each field). Final indicators from expert consensus were assessed from 180 ADHD patients, which were assessed by three child and adolescent psychiatrists. All items were analyzed for internal coefficient reliability. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) was used to calculate the cut off score. Results: Thirteen indicators were assessed by experts as good content validity for clinical outcomes of ADHD treatment with the reliability of 0.60. The optimal cut-off point was 4 (sensitivity: 0.80; specificity: 0.76). The Area under curve (AUC) of total score was considered at a good level (0.83). Conclusion: The ADHD clinical outcome checklist with 13 items has shown good validity and fair reliability. It can be a useful tool for ADHD treatment outcome assessment in clinical setting. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85019220804,"Objective: To compare and evaluate the efficacy of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) extracts in NLC for treatment of osteoarthritis of knee compared to 1% diclofenac gel as an active control. Material and Method: One hundred twenty patients age 50 to 75 years with OA knee, based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were randomized into two groups receiving ginger extracts in NLC and control 1% diclofenac gel for 12 weeks. The efficacy of treatment was monitored at 4, 8, and 12 weeks by using the WOMAC composite index and the Patient Global Assessment (PGA). The t-test was used to compare the mean scores at baseline in each group. Repeated ANOVA was used to compare the mean scores, and Chi-square test was used to compare the dichotomous variables between the two groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: One hundred eighteen participants completed the study and were included in the ITT efficacy analysis. Both ginger extract in NLC and diclofenac gel could significantly improve knee pain, stiffness, physical function, and PGA following 12 weeks of treatment. In the repeated ANOVA, there were no differences in the result between these two groups. The response rate for at least a 50% reduction in pain was significantly greater following Ginger extract in NLC treatment compared to topical diclofenac [40/59 (67.7%) vs. 27/59 (45.7%) p<0.05]. There were no significant adverse events.

2-s2.0-85019199111,"Objective: Explore the characteristics of insomnia in persons with heart failure and identify the predictive factors of insomnia in patients with heart failure. Marital and Method: A predictive correlational research design was used. Three hundred forty heart failure patients followed-up at heart clinics, outpatient departments of 10 tertiary hospitals from all regions in Thailand, were selected by multi-stage random sampling. Data were collected between July 2009 and January 2010. Research instrument included demographic questionnaire, state-trait anxiety inventory questionnaire, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, dyspnea questionnaire, Berlin Questionnaire, hygiene awareness and practice scale, and dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep and insomnia severity index. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistic, Chi-square test, and logistic regression. Results: Thirty-two percent of heart failure patients had insomnia. Eighty-one patients had moderate insomnia (23.8%), and 28 patients had severe insomnia (8.2%). Most heart failure patients had insomnia of mixed types (73.40%), including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and waking up too early. Correlated factors of insomnia included the predisposing factors, anxiety and depression, the precipitating factors, marital status, dyspnea, sleep disorder breathing, and the perpetuating factors, sleep hygiene and dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. After using logistic regression analysis, the predictive factors of insomnia were anxiety, depression, marital status (separated, divorced, and widowed), dyspnea, and dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep with a 95% confidence level (α = 0.05). However, age, gender, sleep disorder breathing, and sleep hygiene were not significant predictors of insomnia. Conclusion: Insomnia is a significant problem in heart failures patients. Therefore, healthcare providers need to pay attention to this sensitive outcome. Several factors should be considered for further management. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

2-s2.0-85019260175,"Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be diagnosed early by noninvasive ultrasonography; however, the cost-effectiveness of ultrasonography screening with intensive weight reduction program in metabolic syndrome patients is not clear. This study aims to estimate economic and clinical outcomes of ultrasonography in Thailand. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis used decision tree and Markov models to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits from societal perspective, based on a cohort of 509 metabolic syndrome patients in Thailand. Data were obtained from published literatures and Thai database. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2014 US dollars (USD) per quality - Adjusted life year (QALY) gained with discount rate of 3%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty on the results. Results: The ICER of ultrasonography screening of 50-year-old metabolic syndrome patients with intensive weight reduction program was 958USD/QALY gained when compared with no screening. The probability of being cost-effective was 67% using willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand (4848USD/QALY gained). Screening before 45 years was cost saving while screening at 45 to 64 years was cost-effective. Conclusions: For patients with metabolic syndromes, ultrasonography screening for NAFLD with intensive weight reduction program is a cost-effective program in Thailand. Study can be used as part of evidence-informed decision making. Translational Impacts: Findings could contribute to changes of NAFLD diagnosis practice in settings where economic evidence is used as part of decision-making process. Furthermore, study design, model structure, and input parameters could also be used for future research addressing similar questions. Copyright © 2017 the Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85019117026,"Inhibition of the host melanization reaction, activated by the prophenoloxidase activating (proPO) system, is one of the crucial evasion strategies of pathogens. Recently, the shrimp pathogen, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), was found to inhibit melanization in the shrimp Penaeus monodon. The viral protein WSSV453 was previously shown to interact with POactivating enzyme 2 (PmPPAE2) and reported to be involved in suppressing the shrimp melanization response after WSSV infection. Here, we characterized how WSSV453 inhibits melanization. WSSV453 is a non-structural viral protein, which was first detected in shrimp haemocytes at 6 hours post-infection (hpi) by WSSV and in shrimp plasma at 24 hpi. We produced recombinant proteins for three components of the P. monodon proPO system: PmproPPAE2, PmproPO1 and PmproPO2. Functional assays showed that active PmPPAE2 processed PmproPO1 and 2 to produce functional PO. Incubation of WSSV453 with PmproPPAE2 dose-dependently reduced PmPPAE2 activity toward PmPO1 or PmPO2. In contrast, WSSV453 had no effect on activated PmPPAE2. The addition of active PmPPAE2 to WSSV-infected shrimp plasma at day 2 postinfection also rescued PO activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the anti-melanization activity of WSSV is due to WSSV453, which interacts with PmproPPAE2 and interferes with its activation to active PmPPAE2. © 2017 The Authors."
2-s2.0-85019560265,"Background: Raising breast cancer awareness is a well-established first line strategy to reduce breast cancer mortality. A properly validated instrument is needed to gain a better understanding of breast cancer awareness. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and validate an instrument to assess breast cancer awareness in Thai women. Methods: In this study, we develop and evaluate the validity of the Breast Cancer Awareness Scale (B-CAS). Construct validity was evaluated by using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, and criterion validity was investigated using ROC curves to examine the associations between B-CAS subscales and breast self-examination. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were also investigated. This validation process employed two independent samples of Thai women aged 20-64 years collected from communities in southern Thailand. Results: In total, 660 Thai women (mean age 41 years) participated in this study. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the construct validity of B-CAS (CFI =0.91; NNFI=0.90; GFI=0.95; AGFI= 0.95; RMSEA=0.044, 95%CI 0.041 to 0.047; P < 0.05). Several of the B-CAS subscales demonstrated strong utility in discriminating between women who do and do not regularly conduct breast self-examination. B-CAS also demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's a=0.86) and test-retest reliability. The final version of B-CAS contains 35 items across five domains: knowledge of risk factors, knowledge of signs and symptoms, attitude to breast cancer prevention, barriers of breast screening, and health behaviour related to breast cancer awareness. Conclusion: The breast cancer awareness scale (B-CAS) was shown to have good psychometric properties in Thai women, and is likely to prove useful in studying the epidemiology of breast cancer awareness in Thai women, and evaluating breast cancer prevention programs for raising awareness."
2-s2.0-85018748093,"Mitochondria play fundamental roles during oocyte development. The accumulation and spatial redistribution of these energy-producing organelles have been linked to the developmental competence of mammalian oocytes. Here, we assessed the copy number, distribution and activity of mitochondria within cat oocytes during folliculogenesis. In Experiment 1, oocytes were recovered from primordial (n = 152), primary (112), secondary (95), early (131), small (118), antral (86) and advanced antral (5) stages follicles, and mitochondria DNA extracted and quantified using qPCR. In Experiment 2, oocytes from pre-antral (n = 44), early antral (n = 66), small antral (n = 59), antral (n = 41) and advanced antral (n = 21) follicles were isolated and stained with CMXRos MitoTracker dye to assess mitochondrial distribution pattern and activity levels. Oocyte's mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers gradually increased as folliculogenesis progressed, with a significant shift at the small antral stage (0.5 to <1 mm in diameter). The location of mitochondria gradually shifted from a homogeneous distribution throughout the cytoplasm in pre-antral oocytes to a pericortical concentration in the advanced antral stage. Quantification of CMXRos fluorescent intensity revealed a progressive increase in mitochondrial activity in oocytes from the pre-antral to the large antral follicles. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that cat oocytes undergo dynamic changes in mitochondrial copy number, distribution and activity during folliculogenesis. These significant modifications to this crucial cytoplasmic organelle are likely associated with the acquisition of developmental competency by cat oocytes. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
2-s2.0-85018736746,"The deactivation of free particles is an important issue for improving the insulating capability and reliability of high-voltage systems. In this work, we carry out experiments to investigate the electromechanical behavior of the non-spherical conducting particles for different particle orientations on either bare or coated electrode. Spheroidal and wire-shaped particles are used for the experiments. The particle motion is observed for two principal orientations with respect to the applied electric field in air. The results show that on a bare electrode, both kinds of particles exhibit the liftoff motion when the particle axis is aligned with electric field gradient. The field nonuniformity enhances the upward rotation of the particle tip subjected to the higher electric field. When the particle axis is parallel with a constant field line, the wire-shaped particle is more readily to make a rolling motion to the region of stronger electric field in comparison with the spheroidal particle, which shows higher occurrence rate of liftoff. The motion onset electric field decreases with increasing field nonuniformity. On the insulated electrode, the wire-shaped particle shows exclusively the rolling motion, whereas the spheroidal particle may make a rolling motion or rotate horizontally so as to align its axis with electric field gradient. © 2017 IEEE."

This program has been increasingly utilized in liver resection. Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of patients underwent liver resection by applying ERAS program. Material and Method: All patients underwent liver resection between January 2007 and April 2011 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were included into the present study. Patients’ characteristics, preoperative factors, operative data, postoperative care that correlated to ERAS components, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Outcomes including postoperative length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, complications, rate of reoperation, interventional treatment, and mortality were compared between patients in ERAS group (applied ERAS components >4) and conventional group (applied ERAS components <4). Results: Three hundred forty seven patients were enrolled in present the study. There were 165 and 182 patients in ERAS and conventional groups, respectively. When compared between these two groups, ERAS group had better postoperative LOS (7 days vs. 10 days; p = 0.0001), ICU stay (0 days vs. 1 days; p = 0.0001), reoperation rate (1.2% vs. 4.9%; p = 0.047) and reintervention rate (15% vs. 27%; p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in complication rate (31% vs. 40%; p = 0.096) and mortality rate (0.6% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.62).

2-s2.0-85018980927,"Background: Extensile open approaches to reduce and fix intra-articular calcaneal fractures are associated with high levels of wound complications. To avoid these complications, a technique of percutaneous reduction and fixation with screws alone was developed. This study assessed the clinical outcomes, radiographs, and postoperative CT scans after operative treatment with this technique. Methods: 153 consecutive patients with 182 intra-articular calcaneal fractures were reviewed. All patients were assessed for early postoperative complications at 3 months from the injury. The clinical results were assessed for patients seen at a minimum of 1 year after surgery (mean follow-up of 2.6 years; 90 patients, 106 feet). In patients who had both preoperative and postoperative CT scans (50 patients, 60 feet), the articular reduction was quantitatively analyzed. Results: At the 3-month follow-up, there were 1% superficial infections and 1% rate of screw irritation. The complications at a minimum of 1 year after injury included screw irritation 9.3%, subtalar osteoarthritis requiring subtalar fusion 5.5%, malunion 1.8%, and deep infection 0.9%. Bohler angle, calcaneal facet height, and width were significantly improved postoperatively (P <.01). Bohler angle increased on average +24.1 degrees postoperatively with a loss of angle of 4.9 degrees at the 3-month follow-up. There was significant improvement (P <.01) in posterior talocalcaneal joint reduction on postoperative CT scan but residual displacement remained. At the final follow-up, 54.5% of the patients reported a residual pain level of 3 or lower. Conclusion: This study suggests that reasonable early results could be achieved from the percutaneous treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures using screws alone based on articular reduction and level of residual pain.

Objective: To establish the pharmacognostic specification of L. japonica flowering bud in Thailand and to determine its chlorogenic acid content and in vitro antioxidant activities. Materials and Methods: Dried L. japonica flowering bud from 15 various herbal drugstores throughout Thailand were investigated for pharmacognostic specification. Their chlorogenic acid contents were quantitatively analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) densitometry with winCATS software. The mobile phase for TLC development consisted of ethyl acetate: formic acid: Acetic acid: water (10:1.1:1.1:2.6). Antioxidant activities were investigated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, ferric ion reducing antioxidant power assay, nitric oxide scavenging assay, and β-carotene bleaching assays. Results: Qualified L. japonica flowering bud in Thailand was presented that the contents of loss on drying, total ash, acid-insoluble ash, and water should not be >10.11%, 6.59%, 1.14%, and 10.82% by weight, respectively. The ethanol and water soluble extractive values should not be < 16.46% and 28.88% by weight, respectively. Chlorogenic acid content in L. japonica flowering bud was found to be 2.24 ± 0.50 g/100 g of crude drug. L. japonica flowering bud showed DPPH and nitric oxide scavenging activities as well as reducing power property.

2-s2.0-85018517852,"Background: Arsenic is widely known as a toxic element and can cause adverse health effects. The determination of total arsenic does not indicate the level of their actual hazard. Therefore, the speciation analysis of arsenic is more significant than the determination of total arsenic concentration. We propose the use of trimethyl aminopropyl-silica-based SPE column which is commercially available and a simple chemical modification of this silica-based SPE column for the speciation analysis of arsenic (arsenite, arsenate and DMA). Methods: A two-column system including trimethyl aminopropyl-silica column (Si-Cl) and silver chloride- silica column (Si-AgCl) was used for the separation of arsenic species. Arsenic concentrations were analyzed by an ICP-OES spectrometer. The pH of solution, flow rate, eluent concentration and sample concentration were studied for assessing optimal conditions. Results: AsV could be adsorbed on the Si-Cl column at pH 7 and was consequently eluted by 1 mol/L HCl. Inorganic arsenic species (AsIII and AsV) were retained on the Si-AgCl column at pH 9, while DMA was passed through the column. The amount of AsIII was calculated from the subtraction of AsV and DMA from the total arsenic concentration. The method detection limits of AsIII, AsV and DMA were 2.30, 1.48, and 2.51 μg/L, respectively. The recoveries and relative standard deviations of AsIII, AsV and DMA were in the range of 97.2-104.3% and 0.72-2.56%, respectively. Conclusion: The solid phase extraction method of the separation inorganic arsenic (arsenite or AsIII and arsenate or AsV) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA) using strong anion exchange silica and silver chloride modified silica columns was successfully developed and validated. The proposed method was successfully applied for the speciation analysis of arsenic in real industrial wastewater. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."

We aimed this cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of physical activity and associated factors among rural elderly Thais. We conducted this study on a sample of 300 elderly in 2 rural districts of Phranakornsiayutthaya province in Thailand. The mean age of participants were 67.5±6 years and 42% of them did not perform physical activity. Prevalence of vigorous and moderate intensity physical activity was 43.7% and 48.7%, respectively. About 43.7% elderly used any active transport and spent 2.81 hours on sedentary activities, daily. Females and those with enough income were 3.64 and 0.59 times, respectively, less likely to be physically active (P < .05). Our study concluded that almost half of the rural Thai elderly were physically inactive. Also male and wealthy elderly were less likely to be engaged in physical activity.

2-s2.0-85018461624,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported as a major cause of cancer metastasis and the failure of cancer treatment. Cumulative studies have indicated that protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream signaling pathway, including CSC markers, play a critical role in the aggressive behavior of this cancer. In this study, we investigated whether vanillin, a major component in Vanilla planifolia seed, could suppress cancer stemness phenotypes and related proteins in the human non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cell line. A non-toxic concentration of vanillin suppressed spheroid and colony formation, two hallmarks of the cancer stemness phenotype, in vitro in NCI-H460 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the CSC markers CD133 and ALDH1A1 and the associated transcription factors, Oct4 and Nanog, were extensively downregulated by vanillin. Vanillin also attenuated the expression and activity of Akt, a transcription regulator upstream of CSCs, an action that was confirmed by treatment with the Akt inhibitor perifosine. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of Akt was elevated in response to vanillin treatment prior to proteasomal degradation. This finding indicates that vanillin can inhibit cancer stem cell-like behavior in NCI-H460 cells through the induction of Akt-proteasomal degradation and reduction of downstream CSC transcription factors. This inhibitory effect of vanillin may be an alternative approach in the treatment against lung cancer metastasis and its resistance to chemotherapy."
2-s2.0-85018301993,"For a number of scholars, syncretism as an analytical approach to a group’s or an individual’s religiosity has several shortcomings. Denoting the mixture of tenets or practices belonging to different traditions, syncretism presupposes a clearly demarcated boundary between the syncretized traditions (McDaniel 2011, 17). It also implies scholarly wrought labels and categories, which are hardly shared by the people whose religiosity becomes the subject of academic scrutiny (Tambiah 1970, 42; T. G. Kirsch 2004, 706). In this paper I demonstrate that despite its shortcomings, syncretism can be employed to expound vernacular Thai Buddhism, whose heterogeneous composition has been argued to be “beyond syncretism” (Pattana 2005, 461). Ethnographic cases presented in this paper reveal that several Thai Buddhists, noting a dissonance between the doctrine of karma and the belief in magic, differentiate Buddhist from non-Buddhist elements. The rationalization they employ to resolve this dissonance is a syncretistic activity that renders their multifarious religiosity internally consistent and meaningful. These cases challenge the assumption that syncretism is inapplicable to the highly diversified and hybrid ways Thai Buddhists observe their faith since they neither draw the boundary between diverse religious tenets and customs nor adhere to a single orthodox ideal. © Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University."

The search targets T quarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in fully hadronic final states. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV the daughter top quark and Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and can each appear as a single hadronic jet. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds. An excess of events is searched for in the T quark candidate mass distribution in the data, which is found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the single T quark production cross sections and the branching fraction ℬ (T → t H) , and these vary between 0.31 and 0.93 pb for T quark masses in the range 1000-1800 GeV.

The measured v2 of nonprompt J / ψ is consistent with zero. The RAA of prompt J / ψ exhibits a suppression that increases from peripheral to central collisions but does not vary strongly as a function of either y or pT in the fiducial range. The nonprompt J / ψRAA shows a suppression which becomes stronger as rapidity or pT increases. The v2 and RAA of open and hidden charm, and of open charm and beauty, are compared. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."

2-s2.0-85018259117,"This paper reports the measurement of J / ψ meson production in proton–proton (p p) and proton–lead (p Pb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data samples used in the analysis correspond to integrated luminosities of 28pb-1 and 35nb-1 for p p and p Pb collisions, respectively. Prompt and nonprompt J / ψ mesons, the latter produced in the decay of B hadrons, are measured in their dimuon decay channels. Differential cross sections are measured in the transverse momentum range of 2<pT<30GeV/c, and center-of-mass rapidity ranges of | yCM| < 2.4 (p p) and - 2.87 < yCM< 1.93 (p Pb). The nuclear modification factor, Rp Pb, is measured as a function of both pT and yCM. Small modifications to the J / ψ cross sections are observed in p Pb relative to p p collisions. The ratio of J / ψ production cross sections in p -going and Pb-going directions, RFB, studied as functions of pT and yCM, shows a significant decrease for increasing transverse energy deposited at large pseudorapidities. These results, which cover a wide kinematic range, provide new insight on the role of cold nuclear matter effects on prompt and nonprompt J / ψ production. © 2017, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration."
2-s2.0-85017249129,"The proposed chemically modified electrode was graphene oxide that was synthesized via Hummer's method followed by reduction of antimony film by in-situ electrodeposition. The experimental process could be concluded in three main steps: preparation of antimony film, reduction of analyte ions on the electrode surface and stripping step under the conditions of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). A simple and rapid approach was developed for the determination of heavy metals simultaneously based on a sequential injection (SI), an automated flow-based system, coupled with voltammetric method using antimony-graphene oxide modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SbF-GO-SPCE). The effects of main parameters involved with graphene oxide, antimony and measurement parameters were also investigated. Using SI-SWASV under the optimal conditions, the proposed electrode platform has exhibited linear range from 0.1 to 1.5 M. Calculated limits of detection were 0.054, 0.026, 0.060, and 0.066 μM for Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II) and Hg(II), respectively. In addition, the optimized method has been successfully applied to determine heavy metals in real water samples with acceptable accuracy of 94.29 – 113.42 % recovery. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-85017471048,"This study aimed to evaluate and compare the ovarian and uterine characteristics along with the ovarian mRNA and protein expression of LHR and FSHR between the pre-pubertal and adult female cats. The uterine horns and ovaries were collected from pre-pubertal and adult female cats at their follicular, luteal and interoestrous stages of the oestrous cycle (n = 6/group). Endometrial and myometrial thickness, uterine gland diameter, ovarian weight and type of follicles were analysed. The mRNA and protein expression of LHR and FSHR was analysed by IHC and qPCR, respectively. The ovarian weight of pre-pubertal cats was significantly lower than that of adult cats. No differences were recorded in the numbers of primordial and primary follicles between the study groups, while adult luteal cats had significantly lower numbers of antral follicles compared to pre-pubertal cats. No differences in the ovarian expression of FSHR mRNA, LHR protein or mRNA were found between the pre-pubertal and adult cats, but significantly lower FSHR protein expression was found in pre-pubertal cats compared to adult luteal cats. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
2-s2.0-85017443574,"The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir are commonly used for the treatment and control of influenza A and B virus infection. However, the emergence of new influenza virus strains with reduced susceptibility to NAIs may appear with the use of these antivirals or even naturally. We therefore screened the neuraminidase (NA) sequences of seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B virus strains identified in Thailand for the presence of substitutions previously reported to reduce susceptibility to NAIs. We initially examined oseltamivir resistance (characterized by the H275Y mutation in the NA gene) in 485 A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Thailand and found that 0.82% (4/485) had this substitution. To further evaluate the evolution of the NA gene, we also randomly selected 98 A(H1N1)pdm09, 158 A(H3N2), and 69 influenza B virus strains for NA gene amplification and sequencing, which revealed various amino acid mutations in the active site of the NA protein previously shown to be associated with reduced susceptibility to NAIs. Phylogenetic analysis of the influenza virus strains from this study and elsewhere around the world, together with the estimations of nucleotide substitution rates and selection pressure, and the predictions of B-cell epitopes and N-linked glycosylation sites all provided evidence for the ongoing evolution of NA. The overall rates of NA evolution for influenza A viruses were higher than for influenza B virus at the nucleotide level, although influenza B virus possessed more genealogical diversity than that of influenza A viruses. The continual surveillance of the antigenic changes associated with the NA protein will not only contribute to the influenza virus database but may also provide a better understanding of selection pressure exerted by antiviral use. © 2017 Tewawong et al.

They are susceptible to latent TB infection (LTBI) which may progress to active infection.Aims To determine the prevalence and factors associated with LTBI in health care workers in a hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among health care workers in Kuala Lumpur Hospital,Malaysia's largest tertiary public hospital. A two-step sampling procedure was used to obtain a proportionate sample of workers from each hospital department. Those selected underwent a selfadministered questionnaire on possible occupational risk factors and a standardized tuberculin sensitivity test (TST). TST induration of =15 mm was considered positive for LTBI. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of possible work factors with LTBI.Results In the 399 study subjects, the overall rate of LTBI was 46%. The odds of contracting LTBI were higher for staff working in jobs other than management positions, staff in clinical areas as opposed to non-clinical areas, staff working for =5 years compared with those working for shorter periods and staff with diagnosed diabetes mellitus or other chronic diseases compared with those without.Conclusions LTBI point prevalence was nearly 50% in health care workers at Malaysia's major tertiary hospital.Our results suggest that there may be additional LTBI risk factors for health care workers and these at-risk populations should have regular screening. © The Author 2017."

2-s2.0-85017183573,"Finding patterns or clusters in streaming data is very important in the present information mining. The most critical issue is the huge amount of data versus the limited size of storage space. In the previous works, the essential information of huge data was represented by subsets of data, grid summarization, or spherical function. Those forms of data representation are not compact enough to capture the topology of the arriving data points and may lead to the lack of information for generating the accurate cluster result. In this work, we proposed a new versatile hyper-elliptic clustering algorithm, called VHEC, to cluster the streaming data in one-pass-thrown-away fashion in order to preserve the original topology of data space. To cope with the problem of one-pass-thrown-away clustering, a new set of elliptic micro-cluster parameters, i.e. boundary, density, direction, intra-distance and inter-distance, was introduced. Furthermore, a feasible technique for merging two micro-clusters was developed. The proposed parameters and one-pass-throw-away clustering algorithm were tested against several benchmark data sets and structural clustering data sets. Our performance was compared with existing algorithms. Regardless of different sizes, shapes, and densities, VHEC outperformed the other previous data stream clustering algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets. Moreover, VHEC is more significantly robust to streaming speed and incoming data sequence than the other compared algorithms in terms of purity, Rand index, and adjusted Rand index measures. © 2017, Classification Society of North America."
2-s2.0-85017140702,"Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of contrast material-enhanced ulrasonographic (US) nephrostograms to assess ureteral patency after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in this proof-of-concept study. Materials and Methods: For this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved prospective blinded pilot study, patients undergoing PCNL provided consent to undergo contrast-enhanced US and fluoroscopic nephrostograms on postoperative day 1. For contrast-enhanced US, 1.5 mL of Optison (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) microbubble contrast agent solution (perflutren protein-type A microspheres) was injected via the nephrostomy tube. Unobstructed antegrade ureteral flow was defined by the presence of contrast material in the bladder. Contrast-enhanced US results were compared against those of fluoroscopic nephrostograms for concordance. Results: Ten studies were performed in nine patients (four women, five men). Contrast-enhanced US demonstrated ureteral patency in eight studies and obstruction in two. One patient underwent two studies, one showing obstruction and the second showing patency. Concordance between US and fluoroscopic assessments of ureteral patency was evaluated by using a Clopper-Pearson exact binomial test. These results were perfectly concordant with fluoroscopic nephrostogram results, with a 95% confidence interval of 69.2% and 100%. No complications or adverse events related to contrast-enhanced US occurred. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced US nephrostograms are simple to perform and are capable of demonstrating both patency and obstruction of the ureter. The perfect concordance with fluoroscopic results across 10 studies demonstrated here is not sufficient to establish diagnostic accuracy of this technique, but motivates further, larger scale investigation. If subsequent larger studies confirm these preliminary results, contrast-enhanced US may provide a safer, more convenient way to evaluate ureteral patency than fluoroscopy. © 2017 RSNA."
2-s2.0-85017132112,"Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and had negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of Vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes in vitro. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients with Vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive Vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyVitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in Vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively. As previous evidences suggested that each factor individually influenced and predicted outcome of CHC treatment. Our results offer a new insight and help to piece the puzzle of Vitamin D deficiency, IP-10 and DPP IV together in CHC.

2-s2.0-85016565751,"Introduction: An individualized dosage regimen is of importance for phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. However, not all patients can afford the cost of therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in rural areas. An approach used to assist individualized drug therapy is needed. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between maximum rate of metabolism of phenytoin and carbamazepine clearance. Such information will be beneficial in aiding individualized drug therapy. Method: Thirteen epileptic patients receiving phenytoin in combination with carbamazepine were included in the study. All patients were studied at steady-state conditions with no change in phenytoin and carbamazepine dosage for at least one month before the study commencement. Serum phenytoin and carbamazepine concentrations were determined by Fluorescence Polarization Technique (TDx® Analyzer System). The maximum rate of metabolism of phenytoin (Vmax) and carbamazepine clearance (CLCBZ) was calculated based on measured drug levels at steady-state. Subsequently, their relationships were determined by simple linear regression. Results: There was a high correlation coefficient between maximum rate of metabolism of phenytoin (Vmax) and carbamazepine clearance (CLCBZ) [r = 0.816; p = 0.001 and r = 0.818; p = 0.001 for Vmax (mg/day) vs. CLCBZ (L/day) and Vmax (mg/kg/day) vs. CLCBZ (L/kg/day), respectively]. This high positive correlation can be of use in predicting Vmax from CLCBZ and vice versa, particularly in rural hospitals in Thailand where therapeutic drug monitoring for either one of the drugs is not available. Conclusion: Elimination parameters of phenytoin and carbamazepine can be predicted by their respective relationships. The proposed equations used to determine maximum rate of metabolism of phenytoin and carbamazepine clearance are of benefit in reducing the cost for drug concentration measurements. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85016305269,"Objective To evaluate pharmaceutical characteristics (strength or concentration, accuracy, and precision), physical properties, and bacterial contamination of fluconazole compounded products. SAMPLE Fluconazole compounded products (30- and 240-mg capsules; 30- and 100-mg/mL oral suspensions) from 4 US veterinary compounding pharmacies. Procedures Fluconazole compounded products were ordered 3 times from each of 4 pharmacies at 7- or 10-day intervals. Generic fluconazole products (50- and 200-mg tablets; 10- and 40-mg/mL oral suspensions) served as references. Compounded products were evaluated at the time of receipt; suspensions also were evaluated 3 months later and at beyond-use dates. Evaluations included assessments of strength (concentration), accuracy, precision, physical properties, and bacterial contamination. Acceptable accuracy was defined as within ± 10% of the labeled strength (concentration) and acceptable precision as within ± 10%. Fluconazole was quantified by use of highperformance liquid chromatography. Results Physical characteristics of compounded products differed among pharmacies. Aerobic bacterial cultures yielded negative Results. Capsules (30 and 240 mg) had acceptable accuracy (median, 96.3%; range, 87.3% to 135.2%) and precision (mean ± SD, 7.4 ± 6.0%). Suspensions (30 and 100 mg/mL) had poor accuracy (median, 73.8%; range, 53.9% to 95.2%) and precision (mean ± SD, 15.0 ± 6.9%). Accuracy and precision were significantly better for capsules than for suspensions. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Fluconazole compounded products, particularly suspensions, differed in pharmaceutical and physical qualities. Studies to evaluate the impact of inconsistent quality on bioavailability or clinical efficacy of compounded fluconazole products are indicated, and each study should include data on the quality of the compounded product evaluated. © 2017, American Veterinary Medical Association.

2-s2.0-85015803111,"Calmodulin1-1 (Cam1-1) gene in rice (Oryza saliva L.) is highly induced by salt stress and transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsCam1-1 are more salt-tolerant. To identify potential proteins and cellular processes that may be regulated by CaM in rice, a comparative proteomic analysis between wild type and transgenic rice was conducted, which revealed 72 differentially expressed proteins. A Gene Ontology analysis showed that several of these differentially expressed proteins were involved in the response to stimuli and signal transduction. Compared with wild type, the transgenic rice had a higher level of a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP), a regulatory protein that binds to activated GTP-binding proteins and stimulates their GTPase activity. Real-time RT-PCR analyses verified that GAP transcript levels were higher in all transgenic rice lines than in wild type. A co-expression analysis indicated that GAP was positively and negatively co-expressed with genes encoding peroxidases and glutathione transferases. Under salt stress (150 mM NaCl), guaiacol peroxidase activity was higher in transgenic rice than in wild type. In contrast, compared with wild type, transgenic rice exhibited lower and delayed induction of glutathione transferase activity under salt stress. Under normal conditions, the H2O2 levels were lower in transgenic rice than in wild type. After 24 h of salt stress, H2O2 levels had slightly increased in both wild type and transgenic rice, leading to slightly lower H2O2 levels in transgenic rice than in wild type. Together, these results indicate that OsCam1-1 overexpression may affect redox signaling and homeostasis, resulting in an altered antioxidant system in rice plants under salt stress. © 2016, Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology."
2-s2.0-85014931392,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is excessively generated in tumors creating an oxidative stress in tumor microenvironment. We investigated hepatic expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and asked if ROS epigenetically upregulated Nrf2 and enhanced aggressiveness in HCC cells. Expression of Nrf2 (n = 100) and 8-OHdG (n = 53) was remarkably increased in HCC tissues compared with the noncancerous hepatic tissues. Elevated expression of 8-OHdG was associated with poor survival in HCC patients. H2O2, as ROS representative, provoked oxidative stress in HepG2 cells, indicated by increased protein carbonyl content and decreased total antioxidant capacity. Nrf2 expression and 8-OHdG formation were markedly increased in the H2O2-treated cells compared with the untreated control. Co-treatment with antioxidants, tocopheryl acetate (TA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) effectively attenuated expression of Nrf2 and 8-OHdG in H2O2-treated cells. HepG2 cells treated with H2O2 had significantly higher migration and invasion capabilities than the untreated control cells, and this aggressiveness was significantly inhibited by TA and SAM. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CpG dinucleotides in Nrf2 promoter were unmethylated in the H2O2-treated cells similar to the untreated control. In conclusion, robust histological evidence of increased antioxidative response and oxidative DNA damage in human HCC tissues was demonstrated. Elevated oxidative DNA lesion 8-OHdG was associated with shorter survival. Experimentally, ROS enhanced Nrf2 expression, 8-OHdG formation and tumor progression in HCC cells. These effects were inhibited by antioxidants. Therefore, oxidative stress-reducing regimens might be beneficial to diminish the ROS-induced HCC progression. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Methods: An age-matched case-control study was performed to determine the risk factors in cats with naturally occurring CKD. Twenty-nine clinically normal cats aged ⩾5 years and 101 cats with naturally occurring CKD were studied. Risk factors were determined by interviewing cat owners from the Small Animal Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, and veterinary hospitals in the Bangkok Metropolitan area, through questionnaires completed between June 2004 and November 2014. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using two independent proportional test methods and logistic regression analysis with backward elimination. Results: Male sex (odd ratios [OR] 2.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–8.87; P = 0.02), tap water (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.08–11.45; P = 0.03) and an outdoor lifestyle (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.03–17.99; P = 0.04) were associated with an increased risk for CKD. Commercial dry cat food (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02–0.17; P = 0.00), filtered water (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03–0.52; P = 0.01) and an indoor lifestyle (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07–0.98; P = 0.02) were associated with a decreased risk.

The intrinsic property of Na-TT with high hydroxyl groups (anionic) provided a strong electrostatic interaction between the MB (cationic) under dark condition. The equilibrium and kinetic adsorption were fitted with Langmuir isotherm models and the pseudo-second-order model, respectively. That is, Na-TT showed the best maximum adsorption capacity of 178.6 mg/g and adsorption kinetics of 0.119 g/mg·min. When the light is turned on, H-TT showed advance its photocatalytic reaction rate of 1.16 × 10−2 min−1 compared with Na-TT (the reaction rate of 1.02 × 10−2 min−1). This attributed the saturated MB adsorption on Na-TT obstructed capacity to absorb photons, and thus the reaction gradually occurred. For the separation of photocatalysts from the suspension by adding alum as coagulant, Na-TT afforded the best sedimentability of which remaining Na-TT in water was approximately 5%.

The enzyme had higher affinity for dcSAM (Km, 20 µM) than for putrescine (Km, 111 µM) and was highly specific towards the diamine putrescine with no activity observed towards longer chain diamines. The three-dimensional structural model for Synechococcus Spds revealed that most of the ligand binding residues in Spds from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 are identical to those of human and parasite Spds. Based on the model, the highly conserved acidic residues, Asp89, Asp159 and Asp162, are involved in the binding of substrates putrescine and dcSAM and Pro166 seems to confer substrate specificity towards putrescine. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

2-s2.0-85014296413,"After the first discovery of seabed pockmarks in the 1960s and 1970s, many examples of both modern and ancient pockmarks have been reported from sedimentary basins around the world. The exact mechanisms and fluids involved in pockmark formation are still subject to debate with many studies inferring that pockmark formation is a direct indication of hydrocarbon expulsion. This study provides the first description of a buried Pliocene paleo-pockmark field in the offshore Taranaki Basin, New Zealand. The paleo-pockmarks are located approximately 1.2–1.3 km below the seabed and are well imaged by three-dimensional seismic data. Their spatial density and size increases towards the distal portions of the fan, and they vary in size between 45 and 580 m in diameter and 2–35 ms TWT. Pockmark size is inversely correlated with the fan thickness in the study area. Detailed analysis rules out any links with faulting, while the relationship with fan variations in the depositional thickness suggests porewater expulsion during overburden progradation as the most likely cause of the paleo-pockmarks. A model is proposed in which rapid sediment loading generated overpressure which was greatest on the proximal fan due to the lateral gradient in the sediment load imposed by clinoform progradation. Fluids were consequently forced towards the distal fan where, eventually, the pore pressure exceeded the fracture gradient of the seal.

Steady-state analysis was performed to determine suitable operating conditions. The effects of the input parameters on cell voltage and cell temperature were analyzed to investigate the dynamic behavior of a PEMFC that is important for control design. To obtain an efficient control system, the control structure design of the PEMFC was also considered to find suitable controlled and manipulated variables. Moreover, the selection of input-output pairings by considering the relative gain array (RGA) as a controllability index was applied to the control system design. Finally, model predictive control and offline robust model predictive control (MPC) based on a linear time-varying model were proposed for PEMFC control. The results showed that the steady-state operating points were selected at the current density = 0.51 A/cm2, cell voltage = 0.59 V, power density = 0.30 W/cm2, and cell temperature = 332 K. The cell voltage and cell temperature depend on the inlet molar flow rates, temperature of hydrogen and air, and operating current density. According to the RGA, the inlet molar flow rates of air and hydrogen are manipulated variables that regulate the cell temperature and partial pressure of hydrogen, respectively. Furthermore, controller design using MPC and robust MPC as a controller can demonstrate good results. Robust MPC can guarantee the stability of the PEMFC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85014065434,"The previously developed gelatin/silk fibroin microspheres were loaded with curcumin and applied for anti-inflammatory treatment in monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) in a rat model. The MIA-induced OA rats received a single intra-articular injection with gelatin or gelatin/silk fibroin (30/70) microspheres encapsulating curcumin. The therapeutic effects of treatment groups [concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in blood serum, radiographic and the histological grading on articular joint] were compared with those of normal saline treated OA and normal rats. The result showed that both microsphere groups reduced the level of IL-6 in serum after 1 week of treatment. The gelatin/silk fibroin (30/70) microspheres encapsulating curcumin delayed the cellular destruction in articular joint and synovial tissue after 8 weeks. The radiographic and histological gradings on articular cartilage lesion and synovial tissue change of rats treated with gelatin/silk fibroin (30/70) microspheres encapsulating curcumin were close to those of the normal rats. It was explained that the slow-degrading gelatin/silk fibroin (30/70) microspheres released curcumin for extended period and showed a prolonged anti-inflammatory effect, compared to the fast-degrading gelatin microspheres. This delivery system of curcumin was suggested to be applied for localized treatment of anti-inflammatory in OA with minimal invasion. © 2017, Springer International Publishing."
2-s2.0-85014116371,"Composite particles of titania/silica/natural rubber (TiO2/SiO2/NR) were prepared and evaluated for their potential antibacterial application. All processes were restricted to a low temperature or a small heating contact time to avoid degradation of the NR. The primary NR particles were synthesized by spray drying and then SiO2 and TiO2 were incorporated sequentially by chemical vapor deposition and liquid phase deposition, respectively. The physical and chemical properties were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, Fourier-infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses. The TiO2/SiO2/NR composite particles had a spherical shape with a diameter of about 10 μm, with titania on the outer layer, and showed an effective antibacterial activity of a 99.99% reduction in viable Escherichia. coli and Staphylococcus aureus within 20 min of exposure under fluorescent light. In addition, the particles could be reused with the same level of antibacterial activity for up to three cycles. The structural and antibacterial models of the composite particles are proposed in this work. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan"
2-s2.0-85013884945,"High conductivity reduced graphite oxide (RGO) was prepared by exfoliation of graphite waste from the metal smelting industry. To improve the surface properties of the RGO, the graphite oxide obtained based on Hummers’ method was reduced by L-ascorbic acid to give RGOV, which was then subjected to thermal reduction to obtain RGOT. The residual oxygen-containing groups in RGOV were almost completely removed by the thermal reduction and the conjugated graphene networks were restored in RGOT. The effect of the RGOT content in natural rubber (NR) on the cure, electrical and mechanical properties of the NR-RGOT (NG) composites was evaluated. The electrical conductivity of NR was increased by the inclusion of RGOT at a percolation threshold of 5 phr, with an electrical conductivity of 8.71 × 10−6 S/m. The mechanical properties, i.e., the modulus, tensile strength and hardness, of NG were comparable with those of conductive carbon black filled NR ones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85013480811,"The effects of crude malva nut gum (CMG) on the texture, digestion and the glycaemic index (GI) of white bread were investigated. Different CMG levels (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% w/w based on weight of flour) were added into a bread formula. The lightness (L*) and loaf-specific volumes of the bread decreased with increased CMG levels. Firmness of the bread increased with increased CMG content. The in vitro starch digestion kinetics showed that bread containing CMG had generally lower predicted GI (74–81 vs. the control). In vivo human testing showed that increasing the CMG reduced the GI of the bread. The GI values of bread containing CMG ranged from 73 to 98 of the control. Overall liking scores of consumers ranged between ‘like slightly’ and ‘like moderately’ (6.1–7.1) compared to 7.1 for the control. Thus, the addition of CMG in carbohydrate-based foods may lower the GI. © 2017 Institute of Food Science and Technology"

Here purified fish oil with 32% (w/w) polyunsaturated fatty acids is co-encapsulated with the antioxidant butylhydroxyanisole, into 1.0 ± 0.7 μm cellulose-based microspheres by solvent precipitation method, at the fish oil loading content of 41% and encapsulation efficiency of 81%. Aqueous suspension of the encapsulated fish oil particles shows significantly improved oxidative stability, thermal stability, photostability and shelf-life stability. Dry powder of the fish oil particles shows excellent shelf-life stability. Double bond functionality of the encapsulated oil can tolerate high production temperature such as the shrimp feed production process (95 °C for 10 min) or spray dry process (outlet temperature of 120 °C).

2-s2.0-85013751948,"Biochar is the carbonized material produced from biomass and is used in several environmental applications. The biochar characteristics depend on the carbonization conditions and feedstock. The suitability of a given biochar for soil improvement depends on the biochar characteristics, soil properties, and target plants. Biochar has been applied at 1–20% (w/w) in the soil, but currently there is a lack of information on what type and concentration of biochar are most suitable for a specific plant and soil quality. Too much biochar will reduce plant growth because of the high alkalinity of biochar, which will cause long-term soil alkalinity. In contrast, too little biochar might be insufficient to enhance plant productivity. In this study, a suitable concentration of cassava stem (an abundant agricultural waste in Thailand) biochar produced at 350 °C was evaluated for green bean (Vigna radiata L.) growth from germination to seed production in pots over 8 weeks. The soil fertility was increased with increasing biochar concentration. At 5% (w/w) biochar, the soil fertility and plant growth were significantly enhanced, while 10% (w/w) biochar significantly enhanced bean growth and bean pod production. The increased biochar concentration in the soil significantly increased the soil total nitrogen and extractable potassium (K) levels but did not affect the amount of available phosphorous. Biochar at 10% (w/w) significantly induced the accumulation of K in the stems, leaves, nut shells, and roots but not in nut seeds. Moreover, biochar not only increased the K concentration in soil but also increased the plant nutrient use efficiency of K, which is important for plant growth.

2-s2.0-85013480638,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in commercial products because of their excellent antimicrobial activity. Entrance of AgNPs and its released Ag ions (Ag+) into wastewater treatment plants could harm ammonia oxidation (AO) process resulting in environmental problems. This study investigated inhibitory kinetics and mechanism of AO from nitrifying sludge influenced by AgNPs and Ag+. The findings demonstrated that AgNPs and Ag+ adversely influenced on AO. Silver ions were more toxic to AO than AgNPs, which was indicated by the lower inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.29 mg/L compared to that of AgNPs (Ki of 73.5 mg/L). Over the experimental period of 60 h, AgNPs at 1, 10, and 100 mg/L released Ag+ in the average concentrations of 0.059, 0.171, and 0.503 mg/L, respectively. Silver nanoparticles of 1–100 mg/L inhibited AO by 45–74%, whereas Ag+ of 0.05–0.50 mg/L inhibited AO by 53–94%. This suggested that the AgNP toxicity mainly derived from the liberated Ag+. Scanning electron microscopy results revealed that AgNPs attached on microbial cell surfaces, and both AgNPs and Ag+ induced cell morphological change from rod shape to shorter rod shape. Transmission electron microscopy showed that AgNPs and Ag+ diminished the thickness of the outer layer and reduced the density of internal parts of the exposed microbial cells, which could be the reasons for the morphology change. Live/dead results also confirmed that AgNPs and Ag+ damaged membrane integrity of cells in the nitrifying sludge. This study suggested that the primary mechanism for toxicity of AgNPs was the liberation of Ag+ and then both of silver species caused cell death. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We aim to evaluate the cardio-metabolic risk factors in adolescents and young adults with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). We performed a cross-sectional study of 21 patients (17 females) with classic CAH detected clinically and not through newborn screening, aged 15.2 ± 5.8 years, and 21 healthy matched controls. Anthropometric, biochemical, inflammatory markers, and body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were measured. Obesity was observed in 33% of the CAH patients. The waist/hip ratio and waist/height ratio were significantly higher in CAH patients. Five out of 21 patients (24%) had elevated blood pressure. Silent diabetes was diagnosed in one patient (4.8%), but none in the control group. Serum leptin and interleukin-6 levels were not different between groups, but hs-CRP levels tended to be higher in CAH patients. Other metabolic profiles and body composition were similar in CAH and controls. Conclusion: Adolescents and young adults with CAH appear to have an increased risk of obesity and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Close monitoring, early identification, and secondary prevention should be implemented during pediatric care to improve the long-term health outcomes in CAH patients.What is Known:• Lifelong glucocorticoid (GC) replacement is the main treatment modality in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia which predispose to an adverse metabolic profile.• Adult CAH patients have adverse cardiovascular risk profile and other long-term health problems.What is New:• Adolescents and young adults with CAH appear to have an increased risk of obesity and cardio-metabolic risk factors. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-85013228290,"We present the results of the first, deep Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging covering the full ≃4.5 arcmin2 of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) imaged with Wide Field Camera 3/IR on HST. Using a 45-pointing mosaic, we have obtained a homogeneous 1.3-mm image reaching σ1.3 ≃ 35 μJy, at a resolution of ≃0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ≃50 > 3.5σ peaks, a rigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with S1.3 > 120 μJy. All of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts (〈 z〉 = 2.15). Due to the unparalleled supporting data, the physical properties of the ALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and UV+FIR star formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the best predictor of SFR in the high-redshift Universe; indeed at z ≥2 our ALMA sample contains seven of the nine galaxies in the HUDF with M* ≥2 × 1010M⊙, and we detect only one galaxy at z > 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies with increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to probe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S1.3 ≃ 10 μJy. We find strong evidence for a steep star-forming 'main sequence' at z ≃ 2, with SFR ∝ M* and a mean specific SFR ≃ 2.2 Gyr-1. Moreover, we find that ≃85 per cent of total star formation at z ≃ 2 is enshrouded in dust, with ≃65 per cent of all star formation at this epoch occurring in high-mass galaxies (M* > 2 × 1010M⊙), for which the average obscured:unobscured SF ratio is ≃200. Finally, we revisit the cosmic evolution of SFR density; we find this peaks at z ≃ 2.5, and that the star-forming Universe transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured at z ≃ 4. © 2016 The Authors."
2-s2.0-85014114721,"While effective analytical techniques to promote the long-term intensive monitoring campaign of particulate heavy metals have been well established, efforts to interpret these toxic chemical contents into policy are lagging behind. In order to ameliorate the interpretation of evidence into policies, environmental scientists and public health practitioners need innovative methods to emphasize messages concerning adverse health effects to state and local policymakers. In this study, three different types of health risk assessment models categorized by exposure pathways. Namely, ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation were quantitatively evaluated using intensive monitoring data of 51 PM2.5-bound metals that were collected on three consecutive days, from 17 November 2010 to 30 April 2011 in the heart of Bangkok. Although different exposure pathways possess different magnitudes of risk for each PM2.5-bound metal, it can be concluded that ingestion of dust causes more extensive risk to residents compared with inhalation and dermal contact. The investigation of enrichment factors reveals the overwhelming influences of vehicular exhausts on 44 selected metal concentrations in Bangkok. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that highlight the role of public transportation and urban planning in air pollution control. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Then, this system was applied for the simultaneous determination of toxic pesticides (e.g. carbofuran and carbendazim). Interestingly, the modified electrode offers an improved electrochemical sensitivity, verified by a drastic increase in current signal of carbofuran (4 times) and carbendazim (12 times) compared to an unmodified electrode. Under the optimal conditions, low detection limits of carbofuran and carbendazim were found to be 10 µg L−1 and 5 µg L−1, respectively.

The success of the encapsulation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The obtained nanoparticles exhibited a regular distribution and spherical shape, with a size range of 450–800 nm as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The encapsulation efficiencies (EE) of the TC-loaded QChNPs were approximately 72–95%. The obtained nanoparticles were then added into a PVA solution to fabricate PVA films containing TC-loaded QChNPs. In vitro release studies showed an initial burst effect followed by a slow drug release. The antibacterial activities of the PVA films containing TC-loaded QChNPs against E. coli, S.

2-s2.0-85010886983,"Depression is accompanied by metabolic disorders in iron metabolism, lipoproteins, and insulin resistance. We measured plasma levels of ferritin, iron, lipids, insulin, and glucose and computed the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2IR) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in MS patients with and without depression and healthy controls. Explanatory variables were serum uric acid, interleukin (IL)-6, lipid hydroperoxides (CL-LOOH), albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), neurological disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and disease progression using ∆EDSS over five years earlier. HOMA2IR and insulin were predicted by diagnosis (increased in MS), age and body mass index (BMI); AIP by diagnosis, sex, BMI, CRP, and uric acid; triglycerides by diagnosis (higher in MS without depression), age, BMI and uric acid; ferritin by diagnosis (higher in MS), sex, CRP, and albumin; and iron by albumin. The HADS score was significantly predicted by ∆EDSS, gastro-intestinal symptoms, iron (inverse), and age. MS is characterized by significantly increased insulin resistance, which is determined by increased insulin levels; and increased ferritin, a biomarker of inflammation. Depression in MS is not associated with increased insulin resistance and atherogenicity but with lowered iron. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

2-s2.0-85008703071,"Acemannan, an acetylated polymannose from Aloe vera, has immunomodulatory effects. We investigated whether acemannan induces IL-6 and -8 expression and NF-κB/DNA binding in human gingival fibroblasts. IL-6 and -8 expression levels were assessed via RT-PCR and ELISA. The NF-κB p50/p65-DNA binding was determined. The structures of acemannan mono–pentamers and Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) were simulated. The binding energies between acemannan and TLR5 were identified. We found that acemannan significantly stimulated IL-6/-8 expression at both the mRNA and protein level and significantly increased p50/DNA binding. Preincubation with an anti-TLR5 neutralizing antibody abolished acemannan-induced IL-6/-8 expression and p50/DNA binding, and co-incubation of acemannan with Bay11-7082, a specific NF- κB inhibitor, abolished IL-6/-8 expression. The computer modeling indicated that monomeric/dimeric single stranded acemannan molecules interacted with the TLR5 flagellin recognition sites with a high binding affinity. We conclude that acemannan induces IL-6/-8 expression, and p50/DNA binding in gingival fibroblasts, at least partly, via a TLR5/NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway. Furthermore, acemannan selectively binds with TLR5 ectodomain flagellin recognition sites. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Some evidence suggests that chito-oligosaccharide (COS) supplements may enhance pigs’ intestinal function after weaning. The present study was designed to examine the effect of COS supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and small intestinal functions in weaned pigs as an effective alternative to antibiotic addition in post-weaning diets. For the experiment, weanling pigs were divided into 5 groups (13–14 animals per group) and received either a basal diet, a supplemented diet with 75, 150 or 225 mg/kg COS, or a supplemented diet with 110 mg/kg lincomycin for 56 days. Growth, feed efficiency, hematological and biochemical profiles, nutrient's ileal digestibility, small intestinal morphology and crypt cell proliferation were measured at 28 and 56 days of the experiment. Pigs supplemented with 150 mg/kg COS or lincomycin showed: (i) consistently more digestible ileal contents (e.g. crude protein, crude fat, ash, calcium, and phosphorus), (ii) increased absorption capacity (e.g. increased villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio for three intestinal segments) on day 28 of the experiment and (iii) more active cell division (as indicated by Ki-67 marker of duodenal and jejunal crypt cells) on day 56 of the experiment (P<0.05, respectively).

2-s2.0-85007508414,"Background: Lip augmentation could be a possible cause of blindness following filler injections. This study evaluated the risk by simulating clinical scenarios of marginal injections to the upper and lower lips and then evaluated the risk of vascular injuries. Methods: A 22G cannula was inserted bilaterally along the wet–dry junction of the upper and lower lip margins in fifteen cadavers, and then both lips were dissected to verify possible injuries to the superior and inferior labial arteries. The position of the labial arteries in the vermilion zone was documented to determine the appropriate injection technique. Results: In the marginal injections to the lips, arterial injuries occurred at the medial segment of the vermilion zone of both the upper and lower lips, at the terminal part of the labial arteries or a distal branch. Considering arterial anatomy, the upper lip has a higher chance of arterial injury than the lower lip. The cannula should not be inserted in the submucosa as it is recommended to evert the vermilion because both the superior and inferior labial arteries are located in the submucosa of the medial and middle segments of the vermilion in all specimens. Conclusion: Awareness of the possibility of vascular injury is necessary during injections of the medial segments of the vermilion of the lips. Vermilion border and marginal injections are recommended for safe and effective lip augmentation. Deep injection around the oral commissure and submucosal injection of the medial and middle segments of the vermilion zone are prohibited because of the high risk of arterial injury.

2-s2.0-85007331123,"Iron open metal site in metal-organic frameworks, MIL-88A and MIL-127(Fe), was tested to investigate its performance on CO2 separation from a binary mixture CO2/N2 under simulated post-combustion system. The sorption experiment tests were conducted via a fixed-bed reactor with different temperatures ranging between 30°C and 60°C at atmospheric pressure. Maximum CO2 sorption capacity was observed at low temperature of 30°C, where 5.24 mmol could be adsorbed by one gram of MIL-127(Fe) and 4.95 mmol CO2 could be adsorbed by one gram of MIL-88A. The presence of moisture in the gas mixture affected CO2 sorption capacity by reducing CO2 capacity as high as 0.5 mmol CO2 per one gram sorbent. In this work, a dynamic breakthrough model was applied to investigate adsorption behavior of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and of the system. The predicted model showed good agreement with experimental results; the Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with our sorption system, suggesting one molecule of CO2 is held at localized sites of the MOFs, which plausibly be at unsaturated Fe2+ metal ion site. Rate of sorption was found to increase with increasing sorption temperature for either intra-particle diffusivity or external mass transfer. Our study suggests that the MOFs containing Fe open metal sites offer an outstanding prospective for CO2 sorption and both MIL-88A and MIL-127(Fe) are good representatives applied for post-combustion CO2 capture. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The full-length genome sequences of the P23_15_TT_1115 and P24_15_NT1_1215 isolates were 25,404 and 25,407 nucleotides in length, respectively, which were relatively shorter than that of US and China PDCoV. The phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome demonstrated that Thai PDCoV isolates form a new cluster separated from US and China PDCoV but relatively were more closely related to China PDCoV than US isolates. The genetic analyses demonstrated that Thai PDCoVs have 97.0–97.8 and 92.2–94.0% similarities with China PDCoV at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, but share 97.1–97.3 and 92.5–93.0 similarity with US PDCoV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Thai PDCoV possesses two discontinuous deletions of five amino acids in ORF1a/b region. One additional deletion of one amino acid was identified in P23_15_TT_1115.

Although the mechanism of action of ALFPm3 against bacteria has been revealed but its antiviral mechanism is still unclear. To further study how the ALFPm3 exhibits antiviral activity against the enveloped virus, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the ALFPm3-interacting proteins from WSSV were sought and identified five ALFPm3-interacting proteins, WSSV186, WSSV189, WSSV395, WSSV458, and WSSV471. Only the interaction between ALFPm3 and WSSV189, however, has been confirmed to be involved in anti-WSSV activity of ALFPm3. Herein, the interactions between ALFPm3 and rWSSV186, rWSSV395, rWSSV458, or rWSSV471 were further analyzed and confirmed by in vitro pull-down assay. Western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy showed that the uncharacterized proteins, WSSV186 and WSSV471, were nucleocapsid and envelope proteins, respectively. The decrease of shrimp survival after injection the shrimp with mixtures of each rWSSV protein, rALFPm3 and WSSV as compared to those injected with rALFPm3-neutralizing WSSV was clearly observed indicating that all rWSSV proteins could interfere with the neutralization effect of rALFPm3 on WSSV similar to that reported previously for WSSV189. Morphological change on WSSV after incubation with rALFPm3 was observed by TEM. The lysed WSSV virions were clearly observed where both viral envelope and nucleocapsid were dismantled. The results lead to the conclusion that the ALFPm3 displays direct effect on the viral structural proteins resulting in destabilization and breaking up of WSSV virions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85008251787,"A microdose cocktail containing midazolam, dabigatran etexilate, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin has been established to allow simultaneous assessment of a perpetrator impact on the most common drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and the major transporters organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP)1B, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and MDR1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The clinical utility of these microdose cocktail probe substrates was qualified by conducting clinical drug interaction studies with three inhibitors with different in vitro inhibitory profiles (rifampin, itraconazole, and clarithromycin). Generally, the pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe substrates, in the absence and presence of the inhibitors, were comparable to their reported corresponding pharmacological doses, and/or in agreement with theoretical expectations. The exception was dabigatran, which resulted in an approximately twofold higher magnitude for microdose compared to conventional dosing, and, thus, can be used to flag a worst-case scenario for P-gp. Broader application of the microdose cocktail will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of drug transporters in drug disposition and drug interactions. © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics"
2-s2.0-85006511570,"Iron oxides nanoparticles have been utilized in biological systems and biomedical applications for many years because they are relatively safe and stable comparing to other magnetic nanomaterials. In some applications, iron oxide nanoparticles were modified with silica in order to be more stable in biological systems and able to be functionalized with various functional groups. Moreover, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was one on the most used polymer to graft onto the nanoparticles in order to increase their biocompatibility, dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions. Therefore, the nanocomposites comprising iron oxide nanoparticles, silica, and PEG could become multifunctional carriers combining superparamagnetic character, multi-functionality and high stability in biological environments. Herein, we reported the preparation of the nanocomposites and effects of their sizes on cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses. The PEGylated silica-iron oxide nanocomposites were prepared by coating of poly(poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate) (PPEGMA) on magnetic nanoparticle-silica nanocomposites via Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). The iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using a thermal decomposition method. The silica shells were then coated on iron oxides nanoparticles using reverse microemulsion and sol-gel methods. The size series of the nanocomposites with the diameter of 24.86±4.38, 45.24±5.00, 98.10±8.88 and 202.22±6.70 nm as measured using TEM were obtained. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used for the determination of % weight of PPEGMA on the nanocomposites showing the weight loss of ranging from 65% for smallest particles to 30% for largest particles. The various sizes (20, 40, 100, 200 nm) and concentrations (10, 100, 1000 μg/mL) of the nanocomposites were tested for their cytotoxicity in fibroblast and macrophage cell lines using MTT assay. The different sizes did not affect cell viability of fibroblast, albeit incubation with the highest concentration of 1000 μg/mL. Although 1000 μg/mL of all sizes of the nanocomposites decreased macrophage viability, the cytotoxicity of the nanocomposites was notably less than silica. The inflammatory response of macrophage was also observed by ELISA, and we found that the size of 20 and 40 nm, but not 100 and 200 nm, obviously stimulated IL-6 production. From this study, the preparations of multifunctional superparamagnetic nanocomposites of different sizes along with the size-dependent effects on cellular toxicity and inflammatory response were demonstrated and could be applied for designing of new drug carriers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85006700610,"Self-management plays a vital role in diabetes management for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). While there are many people with T2DM in Vietnam, clinical understanding of diabetes self-management (DSM) in this context is limited due to the lack of a valid measurement instrument. Translation and back-translation processes were used to translate the Diabetes Self-Management Instrument (DSMI) into Vietnamese. Then, translation equivalence, face validity, construct validity, and internal consistency were assessed in a sample of 198 Vietnamese adults with T2DM. The Cronbach's alpha of the V-DSMI was.92, with a number of significant inter-item correlations. The Vietnamese version of the Diabetes Self-Management Instrument (V-DSMI) retained the meaning of the original English version, and the language of the V-DSMI was clearly understandable to adults with T2DM in Vietnam. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the goodness of fit between the data and the previously identified factor structure. These results indicated that the V-DSMI is acceptable for use with Vietnamese adults with T2DM in further practice and research. However, future studies would be beneficial to determine the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of the V-DSMI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85005822696,"New types of colloidal multifunctional nanocomposites that combine superparamagnetic character and high photocatalytic activity were synthesized and investigated. The superparamagnetic nanocomposites composed of anatase titania, silica, and iron oxide nanoparticles (TSI) were synthesized using thermal decomposition method followed by microemulsion method, without calcination at high temperature. Different techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize and confirm the structure of the nanocomposites. These nanocomposites showed high photocatalytic activity when used in the photodegradation of methylene blue under irradiation with a black light lamp. Moreover, the nanocomposites exhibited high antibacterial properties. From our study, the nanocomposites can be useful in various applications such as removal of pollutants with readily separation from the environment using an external magnetic field. These composites could effectively photo-degrade the dye at least three cycles without regeneration. The effects of silica shell thickness on the photocatalytic activity was investigated, and the thickness of 6 nm of the silica interlayer is enough for the inhibition of electron translocation between titania and iron oxide nanoparticles and maintaining the efficiency of photocatalytic activity of titania nanoparticles. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85006149976,"Nanotechnology on magnetism and magnetic materials has been developed and studied extensively for the recent decades. Magnetic nanoparticles were applied in magnetic targeting, magnetic drug carriers, and diagnostic materials. In this work, the development of magnetic nanocomposites and their applications as drug carriers for dentistry were investigated. Well-defined ferromagnetic magnetite nanocubes (FMNCs) with the diameter of around 60 nm were synthesized using a thermal decomposition method at 290 °C with iron-oleate complexes as starting materials resulting in nanostructure with high saturation magnetization. The FMNCs were then coated with poly(2-(dimethyl amino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), a water-soluble, biodegradable, and pH-responsive polymer, in order to become good drug carriers with excellent dispersity in biological buffer, low cytotoxicity, and controllable drug release. The polymer coating was performed using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). By using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, FMNCs/PDMAEMA showed the high compatibility in fibroblast and macrophage cell line with the cell viability of more than 80% after incubation with the highest nanocomposites concentration of 100 μg/mL for 24 h. Furthermore, the FMNCs/PDMAEMA subsequently demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages by suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner. The behavior of model drug alkaline hyperchlorite released from the FMNCs/PDMAEMA indicated that the drug release could be controlled by altering pH of the environment. As a result of successfully synthesized FMCNs/PDMAEMA, dentine infiltration of FMNCs/PDMAEMA was performed. It was observed that FMNCs/PDMAEMA could significantly infiltrate the dentine within 30 min under an external magnetic field. Our findings indicated the therapeutic potential of the FMNCs/PDMAEMA as transdentinal drug carriers with its high biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory property. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85003845809,"Background: Previous studies have reported that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to osteoporosis in HIV-infected individuals. However, their effects on alveolar bone are not well established. The objective of this study was to measure the alveolar bone mineral density (BMD) of HIV-infected patients, with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART), in comparison with that of HIV-free individuals, and to determine factors associated with the BMD of alveolar bone. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in non-HIV-infected individuals and HIV-infected individuals, with and without ART. Medical status and clinical data were recorded. Periapical radiographs of maxillary and mandibular right premolars were analysed for changes of alveolar BMD based on HIV/ART status. Other factors associated with the changes of alveolar BMD were explored using a parametric multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results: One-hundred and one HIV-infected individuals receiving ART (age range: 23–57 years; median age 39 years), 58 receiving no ART (age range: 20–59 years; median age 34 years) and 50 HIV-negative individuals (age range: 19–59 years; median age 36 years) were enrolled. Neither HIV status nor use of ART was significantly associated with the changes of alveolar BMD. Conclusion: Although osteoporosis has been reported in HIV-infected individuals treated with ART, alveolar BMD does not appear to be changed as a result of the infection, or use of ART. © 2016 FDI World Dental Federation"

A one-step synthetic route was presented in which no additional film fabrication steps were required. The mesoporous micrograss structure comprised numerous interconnected nanoleaves. The synergistic combination of the unique morphology and carbon doping can offer superior room-temperature gas sensing activity for detecting alcohol and acetone. The sensitivity of the devices to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and acetone was also tested. The gas sensing test results showed that the 3D hierarchical carbon-doped ZrO2 based sensor exhibited excellent gas sensing performance at room temperature in terms of high response, short response/recovery times, good repeatability, long-term stability and superior selectivity to acetone, and has much higher response in comparison with the ZrO2 sensor derived from commercial starting material. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84997426753,"Sperm cryopreservation offers a long-term preservation of male genetic materials for future assisted reproductive technologies. However, dramatic changes in temperature during freezing and thawing injure sperm cells. While motility is essential for AI and membrane integrity is crucial for in vitro fertilization (IVF), sperm DNA integrity is a common index of fertilizing capability required for AI, IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In endangered felids died unexpectedly, attempts have been made to recover as many DNA intact spermatozoa as possible from epididymis and testis to increase the opportunity to produce offspring in future. Although sperm from caudal epididymis has shown retained fertilizing capability after freezing and thawing (27.3% conception rate after unilateral intrauterine insemination), sperm recovery from the corpus epididymis has been suggested as an alternative to increase the amount of preserved genetic materials. To improve epididymal sperm quality, pre-treatment with single-layer centrifugation resulted in selection of sperm cells with intact DNA while post-thaw treatment with extracellular ATP incubation promoted the blastocyst rate. Cold storage of domestic cat testis for 7 days at 4°C demonstrated <1% of sperm cells with fragmented DNA. Moreover, isolated testicular sperm cells, stored for 7 days at 4°C, produced after ICSI poorer percentages of cleavage, morula and blastocyst than the fresh control. In wild felids, a death-to-necropsy time of 2 hr after a jungle cat (Felis chaus) aged 10 years died during anaesthesia plus another necropsy-to-sperm recovery time of 25 hr has been reported to yield the post-thawed testicular sperm with 22.2% intact DNA. In summary, the chromatin structure of feline ejaculated and epididymal sperm seems to be tolerated to cold storage and cryopreservation; thus, fertilizing capability is well protected. In contrast, the cat testicular sperm DNA is generally damaged through the cryopreservation. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
2-s2.0-84995593578,"The genetics of patellar luxation (PL) were investigated in Pomeranian dogs presented at the Small Animal Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University. A cohort of 339 Pomeranian dogs, part of a four-generation pedigree of 842 Pomeranians, was screened for PL from 2006 to 2013. PL was present in 77% of the screened dogs, with 84% having bilateral and 16% unilateral luxation. Medial PL was more common (95%) than lateral PL (2%) or bidirectional PL (3%). The risk of PL was similar in male and female dogs (female:male relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 0.98–1.25). The heritability of PL in the screened population was 0.44 ± 0.04 using a threshold model. A genome-wide association study of PL (48 cases and 48 controls) using a high-density SNP array indicated the possible involvement of 15 chromosomal regions, of which CFA05 and CFA32 remained associated in a larger study involving an additional 128 cases and 7 controls.

2-s2.0-85006054809,"The Indochinese leopard (Panthera pardus delacouri) population, included in CITES Appendix I, has been declining for decades. Proper gamete preservation condition is critical for breeding programme management using artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization (IVF). The present study aimed at investigating the impact of post-thawing treatment of leopard semen with extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATPe) on sperm quality (including morphological traits and ability to fertilize an oocyte). Semen from six adult male leopards was collected by electroejaculation (one ejaculation per cat). After the evaluation of the fresh sample quality, the semen was cryopreserved (10 × 106 cells per straw; two straws per cat). After thawing, the sperm sample from the first straw of each cat was divided into three aliquots: control (no ATPe), supplemented with 1.0 or 2.5 mM ATPe that were evaluated for sperm quality at 10, 30 min and 3 hr post-thawing. The sperm sample from the second straw, supplemented with 0, 1.0 or 2.5 mM ATPe for 30 min, was assessed for IVF with domestic cat oocytes. Sperm quality (all metrics) was negatively affected by the cryopreservation process (p ≤.05). However, the percentage of sperm motility, level of progressive motility and percentage of plasma membrane integrity did not differ (p >.05) among post-thawing groups. The sperm mitochondrial membrane potential was enhanced (p ≤.05) by ATPe treatment (1.0 and 2.5 mM; 10 min to 3 hr of incubation). Furthermore, incubation of ATPe (1.0 and 2.5 mM) for 30 min could promote sperm velocity patterns (curvilinear velocity; VCL and straight line velocity; VSL) (p ≤.05). The percentage of pronuclear formation and cleaved embryos was increased (p ≤.05) after 1.0 ATPe treatment (49.8 ± 2.8; 45.9 ± 1.5) compared to 0 mM (41.4 ± 3.3; 38.9 ± 0.5) whereas the number of sperm binding/oocyte did not significantly differ among groups. In summary, we suggest that ATPe activated the velocity of Indochinese leopard sperm motility that may lead to faster sperm/oocyte binding and sperm penetration (factors of successful embryo development). © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
2-s2.0-84991730493,"Clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa) produced high proportion of abnormal spermatozoa (mainly tail defects) that can limit sperm movement and conception. The study aimed to better identify the origin of those defects using a demembranation approach. Ejaculates (1–2 ejaculations/male; n = 9) were allocated to simple washing (control; resulting in 11.7% ± 1.9% coiled tails) and processed through colloid centrifugation to reduce the number of sperm with tail defects (treatment, resulting in 5.9% ± 0.9% coiled tails). Aliquots of semen were incubated in hypo-osmotic solution (HOS, 60 mOsm fructose solution) containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (a reducing agent) to prevent oxidation of sperm membrane. Thereafter, 20% Triton X-100 (TX) (a detergent) was added to the HOS/DTT-treated samples. After HOS/DTT incubation, the control samples and sperm-selected samples presented 73.4% ± 3.1% and 73.9% ± 2.5% swollen sperm (bent and coiled) indicating membrane intact, respectively. Most of the coiled tail in the raw ejaculates could not be opened by TX indicating that the cause of coiled sperm tails may be from testicular origin. The proportion of sperm with tightly coiled tail tended to be lower in the sperm-selected group than control group (18.8% ± 3.8% and 26.5% ± 3.4%; p =.1), whereas the sperm opened up by TX tended to be higher in the sperm-selected group (53.6% ± 10.4% and 21.1% ± 7.9%; p =.06). The results indicated TX was able to uncoil half of the tightly coiled sperm in the semen undergone preparation. In conclusion, the coiled sperm in the clouded leopard semen were likely not a defect of sperm volume regulation during post-ejaculate (osmotic swelling) but pre-ejaculate origin. Semen preparation demonstrated its ability to lessen the primary sperm defects and selected spermatozoa that were prone to be mitigated after demembranation. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"

Compared to the control embryos, higher expressions of H3K9/18/23 ac were observed in TSA-iSCNT embryos and IVF embryos at most following stages (2 h post-fusion / post-insemination (PF/PI) to eight-cell stage). At 6 h PF/PI the expression of H3K9/23 ac in TSA-iSCNT embryos and IVF embryos were lower than those in control embryos, and the expression of H3K18ac was no difference among the three groups. The expression of H3K9/23 ac increased in TSA-iSCNT embryos and IVF embryos at pronuclear (PN) stages. The expression of H3K9me2 in TSA-iSCNT embryos resembled that of IVF embryos at 2 h PF/PI to PN stages, and these expression levels were greater than those of control embryos. These results suggest that treatment of iSCNT embryos with TSA modifies the patterns of histone modification at certain lysine residues in a manner that is comparable with that seen in IVF during early embryogenesis. © 2016 Japanese Society of Animal Science"
2-s2.0-84980642001,"Objectives: Life expectancy is an important indicator informing decision making in policies relating to HIV-infected people. Studies estimating life expectancy after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have noted differences between income regions. The objective of our study was to perform a meta-analysis to assess life expectancy of HIV-positive people after starting cART, and to quantify differences between low/middle- and high-income countries. Methods: Eight cohort studies estimating life expectancy in HIV-positive people initiating cART aged ≥ 14 years using the abridged life table method were identified. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimated outcomes, overall and by income region. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with the I2 statistic. We estimated additional years of life expected after starting cART at ages 20 and 35 years. Results: Overall life expectancy in high-income countries was an additional 43.3 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 42.5–44.2 years] and 32.2 years (95% CI 30.9–33.5 years) at ages 20 and 35 years, respectively, and 28.3 (95% CI 23.3–33.3) and 25.6 (95% CI 22.1–29.2) additional years, respectively, in low/middle-income countries. In low/middle-income countries, life expectancy after starting cART at age 20 years was an additional 22.9 years (95% CI 18.4–27.5 years) for men and 33.0 years (95% CI 30.4–35.6 years) for women, but was similar in the two sexes in high-income countries. In all income regions, life expectancy after starting cART increased over calendar time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the life expectancy of HIV-positive people after starting cART has improved over time. Monitoring life expectancy into the future is important to assess how changes to cART guidelines will affect patient long-term outcomes. © 2016 British HIV Association"

To enhance the thermal, mechanical, swelling, and antimicrobial properties of the WPU, various metals (silver nitrate, copper acetate, cobalt acetate, and zinc acetate) were incorporated to form WPU/metal composites. In addition, the study investigated the effects of the metal types on the WPU properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the synthesis of the WPU containing pyridine. Atomic force microscopy illustrated that the added metals increased the WPU surface roughness. The contact angle and degree of swelling tests demonstrated that the added metal reduced the WPU hydrophilicity, and with the addition of other metal types, the hydrophobicity increased considerably. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that the initial decomposition temperature of the highest WPU thermal stability was attributed to zinc. In addition, the results of differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis showed that adding a small amount of metal increased the hard and soft segment glass transition temperatures. A universal strength tester validated that the WPU mechanical properties varied with the different metal additives and that the WPU strength increased. However, the WPU toughness and ductility decreased with the addition of metals; silver provided the highest mechanical strength. An antimicrobial test indicated that silver enhanced the antimicrobial property. The moisture permeability and waterproof property of the WPU coating was also analyzed. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-84989213644,"Background: Low enrolment and high drop-out rates are common problems in voluntary health insurance schemes. Yet, most studies in this research area focus on community-based health insurance and enrolment, rather than drop-out. Objective: This study examines what causes informal sector families not to renew their voluntary National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) health insurance membership in Eastern Sudan. Methods: Primary data from about 600 informal sector households that dropped out or remained insured, collected through a household survey conducted in March 2014, were used. Logistic regressions were employed to examine what determines drop-out of the voluntary NHIF scheme. Results: The logistic regression results are consistent with the existing literature and confirm the importance of household head, household and community characteristics. Notably, worse family health status and higher health care utilization decrease the probability of drop-out, which requires further analysis as it may indicate the problem of adverse selection and insufficient risk management. Most importantly, the results consistently show that household heads who are satisfied with health services and those who understand the main features of the voluntary NHIF scheme are less likely to drop out. Also, 30 % of drop-out households hold a social support card and reported that the social support scheme is the main reason for not renewing their voluntary NHIF health insurance membership as they qualify for sponsored NHIF health insurance membership. Conclusions: This study shows that satisfaction with health services and knowledge of the health insurance scheme are important factors explaining drop-out of a national health insurance programme. The results suggest that education and information campaigns should be developed further to raise understanding of the NHIF voluntary scheme. In addition, information systems and coordination between the main agencies should be strengthened to reduce administrative costs and ensure policy coherence. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85022346611,"The effect of the system hydrodynamics in a circulating fluidized bed downer (CFBD) reactor with a reducing operating pressure and solid mass flux on the hydrodynamics in a downer reactor were evaluated using a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation. Five low operating pressure conditions (0.90 to 0.99 atm) and four different solid mass fluxes (250 to 1,000 kg/m2 s) were explored. The simulation results demonstrated that the CFBD reactor had a higher mean free path when operated with a low solid mass flux than with a high solid mass flux. Moreover, a large difference between the operating and atmospheric pressures induced a high system turbulence or oscillation. The CFBD reactor with hydrodynamic fluctuation showed a good solid circulation between the gas and solid particles, as reflected by the solid volume fraction and velocities and granular temperature. These phenomena will be suitable for the chemical reaction systems. Therefore, a suitable solid mass flux was in the range of 500 to 750 kg/m2 s for all operating pressures under study because of the appropriate solid particle amount and the mixing in the system. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

While the initial sonorants have completely lost their historical voicing distinction and developed a six-way tonal contrast, the obstruent series still preserves the original voicing contrast, leaving the tonal split incomplete. This paper presents the first acoustic study of tones and onsets in Cao Báng Tai. Although f0, VOT, and voice quality were all found to play a role in the system of laryngeal contrasts, the three speakers considered varied in terms of the patterns of acoustic cues used to distinguish between onset types, particularly the breathy voiced onset /b/.

2-s2.0-85022331564,"ASCE 7 allows structural engineers to use Response Spectrum Analysis (RSA) procedure to compute the seismic design forces of the structures. However, seismic shear demands of reinforced concrete (RC) walls determined by RSA have been found to be inadequate by many researchers. This paper aims to investigate the seismic shear demands of RC core walls from low-rise to high-rise buildings. RC split core walls in five buildings varying from 5 to 25 stories subjected to earthquake ground motions in Bangkok and Chiang Mai of Thailand were first designed by RSA procedure in ASCE 7-10. Then nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) was conducted to compute more accurate seismic demands of the structures. The results demonstrated that shear demands of core walls from NLRHA were significantly larger than those from RSA procedure. The shear amplifications of core walls in cantilever-wall direction were larger than those in coupled-wall direction. The two building locations having different spectrum shapes led to different shear amplifications. Hence, an empirical formula cannot be applied to every location. In Bangkok, it is found that Rejec et al. (2012)’s equation could well estimate shear forces in cantilever direction of core walls but it significantly overestimated shear forces in coupled direction of core walls. In Chiang Mai, Luu et al. (2014)’s equation provided good estimation of shear forces in both directions of core walls. Beside these two equations, the shear magnification factor equation in EC8 is found acceptable to be adopted to multiply with shear force from RSA procedure before using it as design shear force of RC core wall in both Bangkok and Chiang Mai. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

The effect of PNS content on the thermal, mechanical, thermomechanical, morphological, and biodegradable properties was studied. The results showed that the addition of PNS caused a reduction of the melting temperature and the decomposition temperature. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the biocomposites slightly increased with increasing PNS up to 30 wt%. The morphological study showed poor interfacial adhesion between the PNS and PLA matrix. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties revealed that the maximum tensile strength and Young's modulus were at a 30 wt% PNS loading and decreased as more PNS was incorporated into the PLA matrix. The impact strength decreased with an increase in PNS content. The addition of PNS showed significantly improvement of the storage modulus of PLA at high temperature (>80°C).

The properties of the prepared MCC were investigated and compared with standard Avicel PH101 MCC. The results from FTIR spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns show that the obtained MCC has typical similarity to commercial MCC. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the crystallinity percentage (%Cr) was increased while crystallite size was decreased through gamma irradiation. At the same dose, degree of polymerization (DP) and solubility in water in dried phase, i.e. 135; 5.46 % were higher than wet phase irradiation i.e. 123; 4.38 %. Degree of polymerization and solubility in water decreases with increasing total irradiation dose. The investigated physicochemical properties of the obtained MCC conform to the European Pharmacopoeia requirements. The results indicated that waste cotton fabrics have a great potential as a low cost MCC raw material and can lead to many applications. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85022329248,"Biochar was prepared from Acacia wood by slow pyrolysis process under different conditions in order to determine the optimum condition of the pyrolysis temperature and time. The temperature was varied from 300 - 500OC meanwhile the time was varied from 1-3 hours. The regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between surface area, APD, and pH of biochar (response variables) and the independent factors (temperature and time). The response surface methodology was used for determining the optimum condition of biochar preparation from Acacia wood. The relationship between all response variables and the pyrolysis temperature and time is fit to the first order linear regression model. The pyrolysis temperatures have the significant impact (at 95% confident interval) on the surface area and APD of biochar meanwhile the pyrolysis times do not. The optimum condition for preparing biochar from Acacia wood using the laboratory electrical furnace is at 434.8OC, 1 hour of pyrolysis temperature and time. In addition, the proposed range of the optimum pyrolysis temperature is 413 – 450°C and the range of the optimum pyrolysis time is 1 – 2 hours. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-84994682670,"BACKGROUND: Phorbol esters (PEs), found in Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCO) and J. curcas pressed seeds (JPS), are known as bioactive compounds in agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. The degradation rates of PEs in JCO and JPS under various conditions is important for the utilisation of PEs. Thus the objective of this study was to determine the PE degradation rates in JCO and JPS under different storage conditions. RESULTS: PE degradation rates were found to be first-order reactions. The slowest degradation rate was at 0.9 × 10−3 d−1 for both JCO and JPS unexposed to light at 4 °C. Light intensity (1097 lx and 4690 lx, representing diffused sunlight and fluorescent lighting, respectively) and temperature (25 to 35 °C) were the significant degradation factors. Light exposure led to 280% to 380% higher degradation rates in JCO than in JPS due to light penetration through the transparent oil. Dried and sterilised JPS showed an 80% to 90% lower PE degradation rate than untreated JPS under all storage conditions since biodegradation was assembly limited. CONCLUSION: The PEs were unstable under the studied conditions, especially when exposed to light and room temperature. To protect against PE degradation, a material should be stored in a light-protected container and below 4 °C. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry"
2-s2.0-85022053995,"The objective of this research was to study the effects of a pretreatment using activated carbon and cationic exchange resin on groundwater defluoridation by a reverse osmosis membrane. Actual groundwater containing a high fluoride concentration was collected and examined. Experiments were operated under controlled conditions: a transmembrane pressure of 0.6 MPa and temperature of 25 °C. The reverse osmosis system with activated carbon and cationic exchange resin pretreatments had higher fluoride removal than the one without the pretreatments, 97% compared to 95%, respectively. Additionally, the reverse osmosis system with the pretreatments also produced a higher permeate flux, 1.1×10-5 compared 9.6×10-6m3/m2·s without the pretreatment. When the reverse osmosis systems with and without pretreatments were fouled, they showed a decrease in fluoride rejection, as well as a permeate flux decline. After the fouled reverse osmosis membranes were chemically cleaned, the permeate flux recovery and the fluoride rejection of the osmosis system with the pretreatments improved. It could be concluded that the activated carbon and cationic exchange resin played an important role in improving the reverse osmosis system as they contributed to high fluoride rejection and high permeate flux. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85016573490,"Magnetic polymeric nanoparticles can be used for selective binding in a magnetic field. However, as the magnetic nanoparticles (MAG) are stabilized with polymers, the separation of the MAG from the polymer chains after use is difficult. This work proposes a combination of a thermoresponsive polymer with MAG allows for the as-desired simple removal of MAG from the polymer chains. For this, chitosan (CS) was conjugated with thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and antibody (Ab) together with the physisorbed MAG as a thermo-magneto dual functional material. The key synthesis steps are (i) radical polymerization of NIPAM in the presence of mercaptoacetic acid so that the PNIPAM obtained contains terminal carboxylic acid groups (PNIPAM-COOH), (ii) the CS-N-hydroxysuccinamide water-based system that allows conjugation of CS with PNIPAM-COOH in water at room temperature, and (iii) the weak interaction between MAG and the CS chain. As a model application, CS is conjugated with the antirecombinant Leptospirosis Ab (rLipL32) to allow the selective binding and collection of the target antigen under the dual functions. This is the first demonstration of a simple but effective solution for MAG exclusion from the target molecules and will be practical for diverse applications, such as diagnosis, sensors, filtration, etc. © 2017 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-85016402277,"Background: Fungal infected denture, which is typically composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), is a common problem for a denture wearer, especially an elderly patient with limited manual dexterity. Therefore, increasing the antifungal effect of denture by incorporating surface modification nanoparticles into the PMMA, while retaining its mechanical properties, is of interest. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate antifungal, optical, and mechanical properties of heat-cured PMMA incorporated with different amounts of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnOnps) with or without methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane modification. Materials and methods: Specimens made from heat-cured PMMA containing 1.25, 2.5, and 5% (w/w) nonsilanized (Nosi) or silanized (Si) ZnOnps were evaluated. Specimens without filler served as control. The fungal assay was performed placing a Candida albicans suspension on the PMMA surface for 2 h, then Sabouraud Dextrose Broth was added, and growth after 24 h was determined by counting colony forming units on agar plates. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the color in L* (brightness), a* (red-green), b* (yellow-blue) and opacity of the experimental groups. Flexural strength and flexural modulus were determined using a three-point bending test on universal testing machine after 37°C water storage for 48 h and 1 month. Results: The antifungal, optical, and mechanical properties of the PMMA incorporated with ZnOnps changed depending on the amount. With the same amount of ZnOnps, the silanized groups demonstrated a greater reduction in C. albicans compared with the Nosi groups. The color difference (∆E) and opacity of the Nosi groups were greater compared with the Si groups. The flexural strength of the Si groups, except for the 1.25% group, was significantly greater compared with the Nosi groups. Conclusion: PMMA incorporated with Si ZnOnps, particularly with 2.5% Si ZnOnps, had a greater antifungal effect, less color differences, and opacity compared with Nosi ZnOnps, while retaining its mechanical properties. © 2017 Kamonkhantikul et al."
2-s2.0-85016336322,"Background: To date, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been used mainly in immune stimulation assays and the interpretation of data can be influenced by the previous immunological history of donors and cross reactivity with other infectious agents. Resolving these limitations requires an alternative in vitro model to uncover the primary response profiles. Methods: A novel in vitro model of mononuclear cells (MNCs) generated from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was developed and these cells were then co-cultured with various antigens from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax to investigate the response of naïve immune cells to malaria antigens by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro stimulation of naïve lymphocytes showed that CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) by exposure to lysates of infected erythrocytes or intact erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum. The depletion was associated with the expression of CD95 (Fas receptor) on the surface of T lymphocytes. Maturation of T lymphocytes was affected differently, showing elevated CD3+CD4+CD8+ and CD3+CD4−CD8− T lymphocytes after stimulation with cell lysates of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. In addition, antigen presenting monocytes and dendritic cells derived from haematopoietic stem cells showed impaired HLA-DR expression as a consequence of exposure to different species of malaria parasites. Conclusion: These results suggest that naïve mononuclear cells differentiated in vitro from HSCs could provide a valid model for the assessment of immunity. P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria parasites could modulate various populations of immune cells starting from newly differentiated mononuclear cells. © 2017 The Author(s)."

The properties of PNIPAAm-CNC hybrid hydrogels were dependent on the amounts of incorporated CNC. The thermal stability of the hydrogels decreased with increasing CNC content. The rheological measurement indicated that the elastic and viscous moduli of hydrogels increased with the higher amounts of CNC addition, representing stronger mechanical properties of the hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogel injection also supported the hypothesis that CNC reinforced the hydrogels; the increased CNC content exhibited higher structural integrity upon injection. The PNIPAAm-CNC hybrid hydrogels exhibited clear thermo-responsive behavior. the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) was in the range of 36 to 39 °C, which is close to normal human body temperature. For wound dressing purposes, metronidazole, an antibiotic and antiprotozoal often used for skin infections, was used as a target drug to study drug-loading and the release properties of the hydrogels. The hydrogels showed a good drug-loading capacity at room temperature and a burst drug release, which was followed by slow and sustained release at 37 °C. These results suggested that newly developed drugs containing injectable hydrogels are promising materials for wound dressing. © 2017 by the authors."
2-s2.0-85013411064,"Harringtonine (HT) is a natural compound, which is mainly produced by the genus Cephalotaxus, and has been clinically utilized in China for the treatment of acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, the amounts of HT in the Cephalotaxus species are very small; therefore, plant tissue cultures have been focused upon to enhance HT production. Qualitative/quantitative methods for HT detection are required to screen superior cell lines. We developed a one-step indirect competitive immunochromatographic assay (ICA) using colloidal gold nanoparticles conjugated with highly specific monoclonal antibodies against HT (MAb 1D2) for simple, rapid, and sensitive detection of HT in plant samples. This ICA can be completed in 15 min after dipping the strip into analytes with a limit of detection of ∼313 ng/mL. In developed ICA, fiber pad which is usually used for conventional ICA, was not used to shorten the time for preparing chromatographic strip, resulting in a decrease in the volume of valuable analytes (20 μL). Considering simplicity, rapidity, and sensitivity of the developed ICA, this study could be applied to a fieldwork study for finding new natural resources containing HT. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85016273515,"The accumulation of chlorophenols (CPs) in the environment, due to their wide use as agrochemicals, has become a serious environmental problem. These organic halides can be degraded by aerobic microorganisms, where the initial steps of various biodegradation pathways include an oxidative dechlorinating process in which chloride is replaced by a hydroxyl substituent. Harnessing these dechlorinating processes could provide an opportunity for environmental remediation, but detailed catalytic mechanisms for these enzymes are not yet known. To close this gap, we now report transient kinetics and product analysis of the dechlorinating flavin-dependent monooxygenase, HadA, from the aerobic organism Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602, identifying several mechanistic properties that differ from other enzymes in the same class. We first overexpressed and purified HadA to homogeneity. Analyses of the products from single and multiple turnover reactions demonstrated thatHadAprefers 4-CP and 2-CP over CPs with multiple substituents. Stopped-flow and rapid-quench flow experiments of HadA with 4-CP show the involvement of specific intermediates (C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD and C4a-hydroxy-FAD) in the reaction, define rate constants and the order of substrate binding, and demonstrate that the hydroxylation step occurs prior to chloride elimination. The data also identify the non-productive and productive paths of the HadA reactions and demonstrate that product formation is the rate-limiting step. This is the first elucidation of the kinetic mechanism of a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase that can catalyze oxidative dechlorination of various CPs, and as such it will serve as the basis for future investigation of enzyme variants that will be useful for applications in detoxifying chemicals hazardous to human health. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

The observed differences between the same and opposite sign correlations, as functions of multiplicity and η gap between the two charged particles, are of similar magnitude in p-Pb and PbPb collisions at the same multiplicities.

2-s2.0-85016124689,"This study aimed to extract the paraffin component from paraffin-embedded oral cancer tissue spectra using three multivariate analysis (MVA) methods; Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Independent Component - Partial Least Square (IC-PLS). The estimated paraffin components were used for removing the contribution of paraffin from the tissue spectra. These three methods were compared in terms of the efficiency of paraffin removal and the ability to retain the tissue information. It was found that ICA, PLS and IC-PLS could remove the paraffin component from the spectra at almost the same level while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was incapable. In terms of retaining cancer tissue spectral integrity, effects of PLS and IC-PLS on the non-paraffin region were significantly less than that of ICA where cancer tissue spectral areas were deteriorated. The paraffin-removed spectra were used for constructing Raman images of oral cancer tissue and compared with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissues for verification.

The experimental design involved the establishment of surrounding sites (10 m from the cages) and a transect extending away from the cage at 0, 10, 50, and 100 m. The organic matter depositions were measured using sediment traps. Surface sediments and bottom water characteristics were also described. The organic depositions of the yellowtail cage farm in Shido Bay on the sediment were quite significant compared to the control site (100 m from the cage) and extended to 10 m around the fish farms. Due to the high organic deposition under the cage, the surface sediment showed an elevated level of organic-enriched sediments, and led to an increase in the production of sulfides. Oxygen depletion of the bottom water was accompanied by organic-enriched sediments and production of high-acid volatile sulfide (AVS) contents in the surface sediments, and caused a significant increase in ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43 −) concentrations in the bottom water. As a result, impacts of organic waste from a yellowtail cage on surface sediments and bottom water quality were clearly found in Shido Bay.

Increased awareness of this information deficit can help physicians identify interventions that will improve patient's knowledge and perceptions about PD. Objectives To evaluate general understanding of PD and identify knowledge gaps amongst PD patients using a validated PD knowledge questionnaire. Methods A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted in 108 PD patients (34 working; 74 retired). The questionnaire covers three domains of PD, including diagnosis, therapeutic options, and disease course with a total knowledge score ranging from 0 to 26. Subjects with dementia were excluded. Results Patient misconceptions were reflected in the mean (SD) total, diagnosis, therapeutic options, and disease course scores: 14.64 (3.32), 7.76 (1.93), 3.85 (1.28), and 3.03 (1.41) respectively. The working age subgroup had significantly higher knowledge scores than the retired age group for the whole questionnaire (p = 0.004), as well as the diagnosis (p = 0.001) and therapeutic sections (p = 0.023). Three dependent variables, including younger age at recruitment (< 60 years old), female gender, and higher disease duration (≥ 4 years), were identified as predictors of a higher level of PD knowledge amongst PD patients.

The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of exogenous FSH injections on (1) the number and in vitro competence of oocytes collected and (2) the developmental potential of resulting IVF embryos after transfer into recipients during the breeding season (February–April). In a pilot experiment, estrus synchronization was conducted in three surplus females (using intravaginal progesterone-releasing devices, CIDRG for 14 days and injections of buserelin (a GnRH agonist). Five days after CIDR removal, ovaries were excised, minced and a total of 133 oocytes were recovered. Following in vitro maturation (IVM) and IVF, 63% of the oocytes formed embryos but only 5% reached the blastocyst stage. In a subsequent study, follicle numbers and diameters were compared between synchronized does stimulated with 0 or 80 mg FSH (-FSH and +FSH; n = 8 does in each group) and oocytes collected either by laparoscopic ovum pick-up or ovariectomy. FSH stimulation increased the main follicular diameter from 2–3 mm to 4–5 mm (P < 0.05) but not the oocyte number (∼20/donor) or the percentage of good quality oocytes (57%) regardless of the treatment. FSH stimulation did not either affect the percentage of cleaved embryos after IVF (25–35%; P > 0.05). Lastly, embryos at the 2-to 8-cell stage (from either + FSH or –FSH groups) were transferred into the oviducts of 11 synchronized recipients. With the +FSH embryos, three pregnancies failed between 90 and 120 days of gestation and two fawns that were born preterm (Days 215 and 224 of gestation) died at birth.

Forced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), 18 experiments were carried out using different combinations of cumulus parameterization and ocean flux schemes. Twelve extreme indices for both rainfall and temperature were estimated from the model output. A statistical omega index was used to measure the degree of similarity among the 18 experiments in phase and shape. The results showed relatively high similarities among the experiments over mainland Asia compared to those over the Maritime Continent for both seasonal and inter-annual variability. The extreme rainfall indices had a lower omega compared to that of temperature. Observed daily rainfall and temperature data at 52 meteorological stations over the SEA region were used to validate the simulated extreme indices. The results showed that extreme temperature indices were generally underestimated across the region. Systematic biases for each simulated rainfall index were also identified. A score ranking system was established to compare the relative performance of the 18 experiments over the 52 selected stations objectively.

This is due to the fact that cellulose is one of the most abundant resources and possesses several unique properties required in medical fields, whereas silica nanoparticles (nSiO2) play an important role in developing materials with high functionality. In this study, cottonseed hull (CSH) was used as a source of cellulose and nSiO2 was used to prepare hydrogel nanocomposite films via phase inversion method without chemical crosslinking agent of cellulose. CSH was first pre-treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for delignification and bleaching, respectively. The pre-treated CSH exhibited whiter fiber and lower amount of lignin as compared with the untreated CSH. The properties of cellulose-base hydrogel were found to be improved as a result of the addition of nSiO2 at 2–6 wt % for tensile strength and up to 10 wt % for modulus and elastic modulus (G′). However, the elongation at break was decreased with the incorporation of nSiO2.

It is also possible, through this inequality, to determine an upper bound of the average total entropy production based on the entropies along the most extreme stochastic trajectories. In this work, we construct an upper bound inequality of the average of a convex function over a domain whose average is known. When applied to the various fluctuation relations, the upper bounds of the average total entropy production are established. Finally, by employing the result of Neri, Roldán, and Jülicher [Phys. Rev. X 7, 011019 (2017)]10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011019, we are able to show that the average total entropy production is bounded only by the total entropy production supremum, and vice versa, for a general nonequilibrium stationary system. © 2017 American Physical Society."
2-s2.0-85021639760,"The canonical tensor model (CTM) is a rank-three tensor model formulated as a totally constrained system in the canonical formalism. The constraint algebra of CTM has a similar structure as that of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism of general relativity, and it is studied as a discretized model for quantum gravity. In this paper, we analyze the classical equation of motion (EOM) of CTM in a formal continuum limit through a derivative expansion of the tensor of CTM up to the fourth order, and we show that it is the same as the EOM of a coupled system of gravity and a scalar field derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an appropriate choice of an action. The action contains a scalar field potential of an exponential form, and the system classically respects a dilatational symmetry. We find that the system has a critical dimension, given by six, over which it becomes unstable due to the wrong sign of the scalar kinetic term. In six dimensions, de Sitter spacetime becomes a solution to the EOM, signaling the emergence of a conformal symmetry, while the time evolution of the scale factor is a power law in dimensions below six. © 2017 American Physical Society."
2-s2.0-85014340978,"Background: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a collagen-related bone dysplasia leading to a susceptibility to fractures. OI can be caused by mutations in several genes including BMP1. It encodes two isoforms, bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) and mammalian tolloid (mTLD); both have proteolytic activity to remove the C-propeptide from procollagen. Case presentation: We report a Thai OI patient who had his first fracture at the age of three months. Using next generation sequencing, we successfully identified two novel compound heterozygous BMP1 mutations. One mutation, c.796_797delTT (p.Phe266Argfs*25) affects both BMP1 and mTLD isoforms, while the other, c.2108-2A > G, affects only the BMP1 isoform. Preservation of the mTLD may explain the relatively less severe clinical phenotype in this patient. Intravenous bisphosphonate was given from the age of 8 months to 5 years. He was free from fractures for 9 months before discontinuation. Conclusion: This case expands the mutation spectrum of BMP1, strengthens the correlation between genotype and phenotype, and supports the benefits of bisphosphonate in OI patients with BMP1 mutations. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85012049714,"Objectives: To examine relationships between location, demographics, lifestyle, beliefs, and experience of hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) amongst women living in two cities in Thailand. Methods: Cross-sectional study of peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45–55 years, from Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Participants completed questionnaires (demographics, health, HFNS (prevalence, frequency and problem-rating) and beliefs about menopause). A sub-sample of women from each location was interviewed. Results: A total of 632 women (320 Bangkok and 312 Chiang Mai) aged 50.88 (standard deviation 3.06) years, took part. The prevalence of HFNS was 65%, average HFNS frequency 8.7 (10.8) per week and problem rating 4.3/10. Women from Chiang Mai had significantly more problematic HFNS, but prevalence and frequency were similar in both sites. Poor general health predicted HFNS prevalence and frequency, while Chiang Mai location, HFNS frequency, age, diet and beliefs about menopause were associated with problematic HFNS. Location remained significant after controlling for education, occupation and age; location was partially explained by beliefs. Qualitative interview responses illustrated the differences in beliefs about menopause between locations. Conclusion: HFNS reports are prevalent with moderate frequency and problem-ratings in these urban centers in Thailand. The results will be included in the broader International Menopause Society study of Climate, Altitude and Temperature (IMS-CAT) of the impact of climate on HFNS. © 2017 International Menopause Society."
2-s2.0-84981186485,"HIV/AIDS and anxiety/depression are interlinked. HIV-infected patients suffering from depression may be at risk for poor adherence which may contribute to HIV disease progression. Additionally, an HIV diagnosis and/or using certain antiretroviral agents may trigger symptoms of anxiety/depression. The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depression in HIV-infected patients from the Thai National HIV Treatment Program. This cross-sectional study was performed from January 2012 to December 2012 in HIV-infected out-patients, aged ≥18 years, from three HIV referral centers. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Thai-validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A score of ≥11 was defined as having anxiety and depression. Associated factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Totally 2023 (56% males) patients were enrolled. All patients received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a mean duration of 7.7 years. Median CD4 was 495 cells/mm3. Ninety-five percent had HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml. Thirty-three percent were currently on efavirenz (EFV)-based ART. The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 4.8% and 3.1%, respectively. About 1.3% had both anxiety and depression. In multivariate logistic models, the female sex [OR = 1.6(95%CI 1.1–2.3), p =.01], having adherence <90% [OR = 2.2(95%CI 1.5–3.4), p <.001], fair/poor quality of life (QOL) [OR = 7.2 (95%CI 3.6–14.2), p <.001] and EFV exposure [OR = 1.6(95%CI 1.1–2.3), p =.01], were independently associated with having anxiety or depression. Our findings demonstrated that prevalence of depression and anxiety was low amongst virally suppressed, long-term antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected individuals. Some key characteristics such as the female sex, poor adherence, poor/fair QOL and EFV exposure are associated with anxiety and depression. These factors can be used to distinguish who would need a more in-depth evaluation for these psychiatric disorders. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85105126979,"A sustainable strategy for conjunctive water management must include information on the temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial–temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential. © 2014, The Author(s)."

Social and communication experiences in the context of play represent a core curriculum that sets a foundation for later learning and participation. Using a new self-report instrument, this article describes data collected in a large-scale professional learning project in NSW, Australia, that aimed to support early childhood teachers, paraprofessionals and other personnel who directly work with young children, including individuals who present or are at risk of challenging behaviours. Using a case application model of remote and direct coaching support and intervention centred on the input of expert practitioners, the reports of participants were collected before and after a series of three sequential workshops with embedded action research processes for participants. The program was designed to increase social and communicative exchanges and reduce the likelihood of challenging behaviours, by providing a systematic and practical framework for the introduction of functional behavioural assessment and positive support planning. Respondents indicated significant improvements in knowledge and skills after the program, along with decreased concerns in some areas. The paper concludes by discussing potential areas for an expanded research agenda into the professional learning needs of personnel in this field and more broadly within early childhood support systems and services. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85059624915,"The aim of this research was to produce konjac glucomannan (KGM) antimicrobial film with added sweet basil oil (SB) (Ocimum basilicum) as an antimicrobial agent for inhibiting coliform bacteria which is the type most often found in fresh-cut vegetables. The concentrations of SB oil in the emulsion that inhibited the most antimicrobial growth were 4% and 6% (v/v). Film-forming conditions were evaluated by varying the volume of KGM solution per area (0.325, 0.455 and 0.585 mLcm−2) and the concentration of SB oil (4% and 6%). After mixing the film emulsions, the emulsions were dried on a tray dryer at 50 °C for 10 h. After drying, the results showed that KGM film made at 0.325 mLcm−2 with SB oil at 4% resulted in the smoothest surface. When the film was tested against Escherichia coli, KGM at 0.325 mLcm−2 with 4% SB oil and at 455 mLcm−2 with 6% SB oil produced the greatest inhibition. Film with SB oil at 4% was used to study film properties. Physical properties of the film such as tensile strength (68.08 MPa) and % elongation (33.56%) as well as water vapor transmission rate (4.44 × 10−3 gcm−2h−1) were determined. The KGM/SB film did not show an antimicrobial effect on packages of fresh-cut baby cos lettuce or spring onion under the experimental conditions. Further work will be carried out to study more closely the controlled release properties of KGM/SB film to enhance its antimicrobial effects. These improvements could help to develop a more successful application for its use as a natural biopreservative in minimally-processed products like fresh-cut vegetables. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85014899814,"The 26 th December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) emanated from an Mw 9.2 earthquake that generated a 1600 km-long rupture along the Sumatran Megathrust and generated tsunami waves up to 30 m high. The IOT directly impacted the Bay of Bengal and east Africa, with over 283,000 people perishing. At the time, this catastrophic event was considered unprecedented and sparked intense investigations to test this claim. It is now believed that four pre-2004 IOT events have occurred in the last 2500 years, recurring every 550 to 700 years. Much of this information comes from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, where a sequence of four stacked sandsheets separated by organic units has been recognised and compared to the 2004 IOT event. Recently, ground-penetrating radar on Phra Thong Island identified a region that could not be explained by the known stratigraphy. The stratigraphy of the area was investigated from auger cores and pits, and several previously-unrecognised sandsheets were identified and compared to the known tsunami sandsheets. The proximity of the newly-recognised sandsheets to the palaeo-coastline of Phra Thong Island does not preclude the impacts of localised storms in sandsheet emplacement or that tsunamigenic earthquake recurrence may have been more frequent in the past. © The Author(s) 2017."

Therefore, it has been broadly used as low-calorie food ingredient in various kinds of foods, beverages, and pharmaceutical products. In this study, the production of dried konjac noodles was evaluated by studying the effects of alkalinity using limewater versus calcium hydroxide and the gelling agent sodium alginate on textural properties of konjac noodles. Drying and rehydration conditions were studied to evaluate the optimum conditions for producing dried konjac noodles. By considering the springiness and cohesiveness of the konjac noodles, the results indicated that using 3% konjac glucomannan flour with limewater and an incubation time of 30 min were the most suitable conditions. In addition, hot air drying at 80 °C for 55 min and soaking in hot water for 9 min were the optimum drying and rehydration conditions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

2-s2.0-85018768320,"Background: Although social-ecological models and multi-level interventions have been recommended for implementing the holistic self-management support for patients with type 2 diabetes, they are complex, costly, and need long-term effort. A more realistic approach would be to identify and implement a single or limited leverage point(s) that is most effective and feasible to create change. Objective: To assess the independent relationships of the social-environmental supports with self-management behaviors in Thai patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1,000 type 2 diabetic patients from 64 healthcare facilities throughout Bangkok. A set of structured questionnaires were used to collect data related to social-environmental supports, and self-management behaviors. The predictor-outcome relationships were presented by beta (β) coefficients (95% confidence limits). Results: Personal support was significantly associated with the overall self-management, dietary, physical activity, and medication taking behaviors. Neighborhood support was significantly associated with the overall self-management, physical activity, and medication taking behaviors. Personal support was found to interact negatively with neighborhood support on the overall self-management and medication taking behaviors. Conclusion: Personal and neighborhood supports are two potential leverage points for self-management support interventions for Thai patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with low and high personal supports may need different strategies for neighborhood support. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85018868839,"Wijitsopon, Raksangob. Collocations and local textual functions of quantifiers in learner English essays. Linguistic Research 34(1), 1-49. Over decades, corpus linguistic research has yielded a number of theoretical insights into linguistic mechanism of the English language. One of these concepts is ""local textual function"", which features a dialectical relationship between lexical items and texts. The concept has been applied to various text types but never to learner writing, even though the production of texts is an important communicative skill emphasized in English language teaching and learning. At the same time, learner corpus research has tended to pay particular attention to lexicogrammatical patterns without relating them to textual output produced by language learners. The present study therefore seeks to fill in these gaps through an application of the text-lexicogrammar theoretical construct to an analysis of a linguistic category that has hardly been dealt with in learner corpus research, i.e. Quantifiers. The words ""some"", ""many"" and ""every"" are among the top 25 function keywords in Thai undergraduates' English argumentative writing, when compared with a corpus of their native speaker counterparts'. They were hence investigated in terms of their phraseological patterns and functional contributions to the discourse of Thai learner essays. Findings from the analysis shed light on the textlinguistic dimension of the quantifiers in native and non-native speaker learner usage and have pedagogical implications."

However, the effect of folic acid on 13-cis-RA-induced cellular damages of developing midfacial processes is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pretreatment effect of folic acid (FA) on 13-cis-RA-induced cellular damage in developing midfacial processes in rat embryos. Materials and Methods: The rat embryos at developing midfacial processes were performed by whole embryo culture in vitro, in the presence of 13-cis-RA (20 μM) with or without pre-treatment of FA (100 μM). The midfacial morphogenesis score, PCNA and TUNEL assay staining were evaluated for morphogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis of the midfacial processes, respectively. Results: The 13-cis-RA-treated embryos at 24h showed atrophy of midfacial processes with significantly decreased morphogenesis score and cell proliferation, and increased apoptotic cell death. In contrast, the embryos pre-treated with FA for 18h, followed by 13-cis-RA treatment for 24h (FA-RA) showed significantly greater morphogenesis score, increased cell proliferation and lower apoptotic cell death compared to those of the 13-cis-RA-treated embryos. Conclusion: The results suggest that FA reduced the teratogenic effects of 13-cis-RA on midfacial process tissue. Future investigations regarding the anti-teratogenic mechanism of FA on the prevention of damages in midface processes induced by 13-cis-RA on pregnant woman are warranted. © 2017 Kriangkrai et al."

Distributions of the angular correlations between the jets and the muon are examined, as well as the average number of jets as a function of HT and as a function of angular variables. The measured differential cross sections are compared with tree-level and higher-order recent event generators, as well as next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order theoretical predictions.

The objective of this study was to evaluate if bubaline fibrin glue would promote skin graft survival in pigs. The grafting was divided into two steps. First, granulation wound preparation was performed in a healthy swine by creating four full-skin depth wounds (3 x 12 cm2) at the dorsal part of the loin area on each side. Second, pinch and punch skin grafting, where eight skin discs (0.6 cm diameter) were regularly placed (0.6 cm distance apart) in the granulation tissue bed of each wound, was performed 5 days later. The bubaline fibrin glue was added prior to application of the 16 skin graft discs in two of the wounds, while no glue was added to the other 16 skin graft discs in the other two wounds. The number of surviving graft pieces and histological examination was evaluated after 3, 7, and 14 days post-operation and compared by pairing between the control and the bubaline fibrin glue groups. The number of grafts that remained at 3 and 7 days post-operation and the number of new microvessels at 3 days post-operation were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the bubaline fibrin glue group than in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the number of fibroblasts, the intensity of scarring and the intensity of inflammation between the two groups, except for the significantly lower intensity of inflammation at 7 days post-operation in the bubaline fibrin glue group. In conclusion, bubaline fibrin glue has the advantage of decreasing the skin graft loss by approximately 31.3-37.5% compared with the control group and also promotes angiogenesis. © The Author(s) 2017."

Polyhexanide/betaine gel, a new wound cleansing and moisturizing product, has some advantages in removing biofilm and promotes wound healing. This study was designed to compare clinical efficacy of polyhexanide/ betaine gel with silver sulfadiazine in partial-thickness burn treatment. From September 2013 to May 2015, 46 adult patients with partial-thickness burn ≥10% total body surface area that were admitted to the Burn Unit of Siriraj Hospital within 48 hours after injury were randomly allocated into 2 groups. One group was treated with polyhexanide/betaine gel, and the other group was treated with silver sulfadiazine. Both groups received daily dressing changes and the same standard care given to patients with burns in this center. Healing times in the polyhexanide/betaine gel group and silver sulfadiazine group were 17.8 ± 2.2 days and 18.8 ± 2.1 days, respectively (P value .13). There were no significant differences in healing times, infection rates, bacterial colonization rates, and treatment cost in both groups. The pain score of the polyhexanide/betaine gel group was significantly less than the silver sulfadiazine group at 4 to 9 days after treatment (P < .001). The satisfactory assessment result of the polyhexanide/betaine gel group was better than that in the silver sulfadiazine group.

2-s2.0-85018351017,"Purpose: Biliary tract cancer (BTC)is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage for which curative surgery is not possible and gemcitabine-platinum chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for advanced cases. Several studies had focused on biomarkers to predict response from platinum drugs in lung cancer, but information is limited for BTC. In this study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the copper transporter (CTR1) and excision repair cross-complementary group 1 (ERCC1) genes were investigated as predictive biomarkers of objective response to gemcitabine-platinum. Methods: This cohort study aimed to assess any associations of genetic polymorphisms of these proteins active in drug pathway with treatment response in advanced BTC patients. Twenty six patients were enrolled. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and genetic polymorphisms were assessed by Taqman allelic discrimination assay. Response was evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1. Results: For the CTR1 polymorphism, GT was the most common genotype (61.5%) followed by GG (34.6%), and TT (3.8%). For the ERCC1 polymorphism, only 2 genotypes were found, CC and CT at 57.7% and 42.3%, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms were not found to be singly associated with response. However, when the 2 genetic polymorphisms were combined, GG/CC showed a higher response rate than the others (p=0.018, Fisher's Exact Test). Conclusion: This is the first study to show an association between CTR1 and ERCC1 polymorphisms and response to gemcitabine-platinum in advanced BTC patients. These polymorphisms might be used as biomarkers to predict response in such cases in the future."

However, it has many adverse events which may affect oncologic outcomes. Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) has been reported to be an immunoenhancer to decrease adverse events of chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: Patients were randomized and allocated to receive either AHCC three grams/day (500mg/ capsule) or placebo. These drugs were administrated as two capsules orally three times a day throughout six cycles of chemotherapy. The primary outcome was a change of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples from baseline to completion of chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes were rate of bone marrow suppression, adverse events and quality of life (QOL) as assessed by Thai version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). Results: Study outcomes were analyzed in 28 patients, 14 patients in each group. Changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lymphocytes levels were not significantly different between AHCC and placebo group; 43.5/ul (-237.5, 143.3) versus -69.5 /ul (-223.8, 165) for CD4+ level, p=0.61 and 49.5.0 /ul (-80, 153.3) versus 4.0 /ul (-173, 62.5) for CD8+ level, p=0.19. However, CD8+ levels were significantly higher in the AHCC group at the sixth cycle of chemotherapy; 392.5.0 /ul (310.8, 598) versus 259.5 /ul (170.5, 462.3), p=0.03. There was no difference in bone marrow suppression and QOL between the two groups.

2-s2.0-85017161520,"Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) widely occurred at numerous subsurface sites can act as long-term sources of both vapor-phase and groundwater contamination. Successful remediation and effective risk assessment of DNAPL-contaminated sites is limited by current source zone characterization techniques and DNAPL unique behavior. A relatively new method of DNAPL-contaminated site characterization involved the use of partitioning tracers to provide estimates of the known amount of DNAPL. A new practical continuous flow system was developed in this work to explore the DNAPL's partitioning tracer-water solubility characteristics under pure phase and selected cosolvents conditions which can be crucial for estimate retardation factors of various tracers with implications for partitioning tracer tests at DNAPL-contaminated sites. Trichloroethylene (TCE) was selected as a representative of DNAPL due to its unique properties and solvent effects. Bromide was employed as a non-partitioning tracer, while three alcohols (i.e., iso-propanol, methanol, and ethanol) effluents were determined as a function of time under pure solvent and 30% cosolvent additions. The three alcohols appeared to have been used successfully as a partitioning tracers for detection of potential DNAPL saturation. Moment analysis of breakthrough curves allowed TCE and alcohol mass recovery and retardation factor calculation, and therefore could further estimate apparent DNAPL saturation. Assuming that partitioning to TCE-DNAPL is the only mechanism for retention of alcohols in the system, flow rate and various alcohol fraction additions seemed to have no major influence on retardation factor estimation of partitioning tracers in the system."
2-s2.0-85017037401,"A measurement of the double-differential inclusive jet cross section as a function of the jet transverse momentum pT and the absolute jet rapidity |y| is presented. Data from LHC proton-proton collisions at s=8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1, have been collected with the CMS detector. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT clustering algorithm with a size parameter of 0.7 in a phase space region covering jet pT from 74 GeV up to 2.5 TeV and jet absolute rapidity up to |y| = 3.0. The low-pT jet range between 21 and 74 GeV is also studied up to |y| = 4.7, using a dedicated data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 pb−1. The measured jet cross section is corrected for detector effects and compared with the predictions from perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) using various sets of parton distribution functions (PDF).

Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3-2.7 fb−1 recorded in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Decays of spin-1 and spin-2 resonances into two vector bosons are sought in the mass range 0.6-4.0 TeV. No significant excess over the standard model background is observed. Combining the results of the ℓνqq¯ and qq¯ qq¯ final states, cross section and mass exclusion limits are set for models that predict heavy spin-1 and spin-2 resonances.

2-s2.0-85017022778,"Objectives The objective of this study was to document sexual and reproductive health (SRH) practices among female sex workers (FSWs) including abortion, pregnancy, use of maternal healthcare services and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with the aim of developing recommendations for action. Methods A total of 731 FSWs aged between 15 and 49 years were surveyed using a stratified sampling in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A workshop with 23 participants consisted of policy makers, researchers, program implementers was conducted to formulate recommendations. Results About 61.3% of 731 FSWs reported SRH-related experiences in the past one year, including abortion (15.5%), ongoing pregnancy (9.0%), childbirth (8.3%) or any symptoms of STIs (41.6%). Among FSWs who had an abortion (n = 113), the most common methods included menstrual regulation through manual vacuum aspiration (47.8%), followed by Dilation and Curettage procedure (31%) and oral medicine from pharmacies (35.4%). About 57.5% of 113 cases reported post abortion complications. Among FSWs with delivery in the past year (n = 61), 27.7% attended the recommended four or more antenatal care visits and more than half did not have any postnatal visit. Adopting sustainable and effective strategies to provide accessible and adequate SRH services for FSWs was prioritized by workshop participants. Conclusion There was substantial unmet need for SRH care among FSWs in urban areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Therefore, it is important to integrate SRH services for FSWs in the formal healthcare system or integration of abortion and maternal healthcare services within existing HIV prevention services. © 2017 Wahed et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."
2-s2.0-85016791059,"The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is an important economic crop, particularly in Thailand. As the plantations extend to new and drier areas, information on physiological parameters such as water use efficiency (WUE) is required to help breeding for adapted genotypes. Carbon isotope composition of bulk leaf (δ13C) can be used as an indicator of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) of plants. A prerequisite step is to analyse the genetic variability of δ13C. We compared the carbon isotope composition of bulk rubber tree leaf (δ13C) in rainy and dry seasons in a collection of 49 wild genotypes of rubber in Northern Thailand. There were large δ13C variations among the genotypes at all seasons. δ13C ranged between -33.3‰ to -30.0‰ in rainy season and -33.1‰ to -29.9‰ in dry season. δ13C was rather stable with a good correlation between rainy and dry season. In rainy season, there was a positive significant correlation between δ13C, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen per area (NA). The average δ13C was significantly different between two genetic clusters previously identified in this population. The large genetic variability of δ13C in wild rubber population is promising for breeding genotypes using less water. © 2017, Malaysian Rubber Board. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85016766249,"Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) is a member of the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). The outcome of CaHV-1 infection can be occasionally fatal. So far, no information on CaHV-1 circulation in Thailand has been reported resulting in a lack of preventive strategies. In this study, nasal (NS) and oropharyngeal (OS) swabs were collected from 100 live dogs with respiratory distress. Among them, 23 pleural effusions were aspirated. A panel of CIRDC-associated viruses was screened by (RT)-PCR, including CaHV-1, CIV, CPIV, CDV, CRCoV and CAdV-2, for all collected samples. The CaHV-1 was detected in 32 dogs. Additionally, CaHV-1 was consistently detected in six pleural effusions. Most CaHV-1 infected dogs were over 5 years of age (43.8%) and expressed a mild nasal discharge. Pathological results of four three-month-old puppies, naturally moribund from respiratory disease, revealed a severe multifocal necrotic-hemorrhagic disease in several organs without pathognomonic inclusion bodies. They were only found to be CaHV-1 positive by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated concordant results of CaHV-1 circulation in Thailand. Although mostly found as a co-infection with other CIRDC viruses (68.8%) it also occurred alone. Therefore, rapid ante-mortem diagnosis might facilitate the investigation of unclassical CaHV-1 infection, which is fatal in neonates and causes illness in annually core-vaccinated adults. © 2017, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

We image that a Gaussian X channel can be considered as a superposition of two Gaussian interference channels based on grouping of the sent messages from each transmitter to the corresponding receivers.

2-s2.0-85015659338,"The aims of this study were to investigate the potential benefits of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic, and anti-tyrosinase activities of a methanolic extract of fresh tea leaves (FTE) (Camellia sinensis L.). The antioxidant capacity was investigated using three different methods at different temperatures. The anti-inflammatory activity was studied in vitro by the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase assay. The anti-hepatotoxic effect was investigated in CCl4-induced liver injury in rats. The anti-tyrosinase activities of the FTE and its principal phenolic compounds were investigated in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) oxidation by a mushroom tyrosinase. A molecular docking study was conducted to determine how the FTE's principal catechins interact with the tyrosinase. The FTE exhibited the best shelf life at low temperatures and demonstrated concentration-dependent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic, and anti-tyrosinase effects compared to positive references. Treatment of rats with the FTE at 2000 mg/kg/day for 28 consecutive days reversed CCl4-induced oxidative damage in hepatic tissues by lowering the levels of alanine aminotransferase by 69% and malondialdehyde by 90%. Our findings suggest that the FTE has the capacity to scavenge free radicals and can protect against oxidative stress induced by CCl4 intoxication. The docking results were consistent with our in vitro data, indicating the anti-tyrosinase potency of the principal catechins. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2-s2.0-85015743748,"A search for new particles has been conducted using events with two high transverse momentum (pT) τ leptons that decay hadronically, at least two high-pT jets, and missing transverse energy from the τ lepton decays. The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions, collected by the CMS experiment in 2015 at s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb−1. The results are interpreted in two physics models. The first model involves heavy right-handed neutrinos, Nℓ (ℓ = e, μ, τ), and right-handed charged bosons, WR, arising in a left-right symmetric extension of the standard model. Masses of the WR boson below 2.35 (1.63) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming the Nτ mass is 0.8 (0.2) times the mass of the WR boson and that only the Nτ flavor contributes to the WR decay width. In the second model, pair production of third-generation scalar leptoquarks that decay into ττbb is considered. Third-generation scalar leptoquarks with masses below 740 GeV are excluded, assuming a 100% branching fraction for the leptoquark decay to a τ lepton and a bottom quark. This is the first search at hadron colliders for the third-generation Majorana neutrino, as well as the first search for third-generation leptoquarks in the final state with a pair of hadronically decaying τ leptons and jets.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2017, The Author(s)."

The objective of this study was to determine the persistent viability of C. psittaci at various temperature conditions. The cloacal swab samples were collected from feral and racing pigeons to find a C. psittaci field strain. The bacterial isolation showed that 1.3% of feral pigeons were PCR positive, while all samples of racing pigeons were PCR negative. Also, bacterial characterization suggested that it belonged to genotype B, which had bacterial titers 3.2 and 3.89 log 50% lethal dose/ml, respectively. A bacterial persistence test was performed, and the results showed that C. psittaci could survive at 56 C for up to 72 hr. In conclusion, C. psittaci could be found in feral pigeons in central Thailand. The bacteria can survive in equatorial temperature areas. This study was the first to report that C. psittaci could survive and has infectivity at 56 C for 72 hr. Therefore, awareness of C. psittaci infection in humans is necessary and should be a public health concern."

2-s2.0-85015211976,"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a motionless ultrasonic toothbrush to a manual toothbrush in reducing dental plaque, gingival inflammation, and mutans streptococci in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five orthodontic patients were recruited to this crossover study. The patients were randomized into two groups starting with manual or motionless ultrasonic toothbrushes for 30 days. After a 30-day washout period, the patients switched to the other toothbrush type for 30 days. Plaque and gingival indices were evaluated by two calibrated-blinded examiners before and after each 30-day period of brushing. Salivary samples were also collected for quantification of mutans streptococci. Results: On the bracket side, the motionless ultrasonic toothbrush showed a significantly higher mean plaque index bracket score after 30-day usage than baseline (P = .049), while the manual toothbrush group showed no difference between the before and after brushing periods (P = .10). The changes in plaque index bracket score were significantly more favorable in the manual toothbrush group than in the ultrasonic toothbrush group (P = .04). In contrast, no difference was observed on the nonbracket side. There was no significant difference in the changes of gingival index or the numbers of mutans streptococci between the two groups. Conclusion: Manual toothbrushing performed better than brushing with the motionless ultrasonic toothbrush in plaque removal on the bracket side in orthodontic patients.

However, anti-tuberculosis drugs can cause cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs). This study was conducted to evaluate differences in CADR incidence between low and high CD4 cell count in patients with low and high CD4 cell count and to identify other risk factors for CADR in HIV-TB co-infected patients. DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort of adult HIV-TB coinfected patients receiving standard anti-tuberculosis treatment between January 2008 and December 2015 at Vajira Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, baseline demographic, clinical characteristics and factors associated with CADRs, including CD4 cell count status, were collected. RESULT S : Of 307 patients enrolled, CADRs occurred in 48 during the 6-month period of anti-tuberculosis treatment (incidence rate 0.41 events/person-year). Maculopapular rash was the most prevalent CADR. Low CD4 cell count was not associated with CADRs. Cox regression analysis revealed that moderate decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, history of drug hypersensitivity and concomitant cotrimoxazole use were all associated with CADRs. Concomitant antiretroviral therapy usewas associatedwith lower risk of CADRs.No difference in the time to CADRs between patients with lower and higher CD4 cell count could be demonstrated.

2-s2.0-85015187333,"We report the discovery of a mysterious giant Hα blob that is ∼8 kpc away from the main MaNGA target 1-24145, one component of a dry galaxy merger, and has been identified in the first-year SDSS-IV MaNGA data. The size of the Hα blob is ∼3-4 kpc in radius, and the Hα distribution is centrally concentrated. However, there is no optical continuum counterpart in the deep broadband images reaching ∼26.9 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness. We estimate that the masses of the ionized and cold gases are and , respectively. The emission-line ratios indicate that the Hα blob is photoionized by a combination of massive young stars and AGNs. Furthermore, the ionization line ratio decreases from MaNGA 1-24145 to the Hα blob, suggesting that the primary ionizing source may come from MaNGA 1-24145, likely a low-activity AGN. Possible explanations for this Hα blob include the AGN outflow, the gas remnant being tidally or ram-pressure stripped from MaNGA 1-24145, or an extremely low surface brightness galaxy. However, the stripping scenario is less favored according to galaxy merger simulations and the morphology of the Hα blob. With the current data, we cannot distinguish whether this Hα blob is ejected gas due to a past AGN outburst, or a special category of ""ultra-diffuse galaxy"" interacting with MaNGA 1-24145 that further induces the gas inflow to fuel the AGN in MaNGA 1-24145. © 2017.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data has revealed a number of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the Vitamin D synthetic pathway that affect Vitamin D functions. We aimed to determine the association between SNPs in the Vitamin D gene cascade and response to pegylated interferon (PegIFN) therapy in hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients. One hundred and eleven patients treated for 48 weeks with PegIFN-alfa 2a at 13 hospitals were retrospectively evaluated. Thirteen SNPs derived from Vitamin D cascade-related genes, including DHCR7 (rs12785878), CYP27B1 (rs10877012), CYP2R1 (rs2060793, rs12794714), GC (rs4588, rs7041, rs222020, rs2282679), and VDR (FokI, BsmI, Tru9I, ApaI, TaqI), were genotyped. Thirty-one patients (27.9%) seroconverted to HBeAg after 24 weeks of treatment. Multivariate analysis found pretreatment qHBsAg 10,000 IU/mL (OR = 7.73, 95% CI: 2.36± 25.31, P = 0.001), CYP2R1 rs12794714 TT genotype (OR = 4.16, 95% CI: 1.07±16.25, P = 0.04), and baseline ALT 2 times the upper limit of normal (OR = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.31± 11.22, P = 0.014) predicted sustained HBeAg seroconversion after completion of PegIFN treatment. HBV DNA during study period tended to be lower with the rs12794714 CYP2R1 TT than the non-TT genotype. The rs12794714 CYP2R1 polymorphism may be a useful pretreatment factor predictive of sustained HBeAg seroconversion after PegIFN therapy.

2-s2.0-85015214116,"BACKGROUND Traditional evaluation of wound healing is sometimes subjective. It is necessary to develop qualitative and quantitative methods to enable more efficient and accurate evaluation of wounds. Recently, new techniques have been introduced and the correspondence between these techniques and clinician judgment is critical. OBJECTIVE Some nontraditional techniques that analyze wound healing were reviewed, which include measurements of the wound area, tissue color, skin barrier function, skin humidity, and keratinocyte morphology. METHODS This review article is based on medical research that focuses on the evaluation of wound healing. RESULTS Software-based and advanced device-based techniques generally provide more accurate and precise results than traditional ones, such as the ruler-based technique. Measurement of tissue color can also help to identify the type of tissue. Evaluation of skin barrier function can assist clinicians to analyze functional restoration of skin, whereas skin humidity demonstrates the exudate production status of the wound. In addition, keratinocyte morphology in the wound bed indicates quality of wound healing and side effects of treatment. CONCLUSION There is no gold standard method for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of wound healing. It is important to understand the type of wound, sample size, results obtained, advantages, and limitations of each technique. © 2016 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc."

The study is conducted to find out the changes in the lipid metabolism of HBV-cirrhosis patients. Methods: In the present study, serum lipid profiles of patients with HBV-cirrhosis were assessed by utilizing micro-lab and gas chromatography, while risk factors for transmission of HBV-cirrhosis studied through the standard questionnaire. Results: The epidemiological and etiological risk factors strongly associated with HBV-cirrhosis patients compared to controls, included as family history, shave from the barber, blood transfusion (without proper screening), mutual sharing of household contents, positive surgery history, and dental treatment. The HBV-cirrhosis patients have significantly lower level (p < 0.001) of lipid profile including total cholesterol (96.65 mg/dl), TAG (82.85 mg/dl), VLDL-C (16.57 mg/dl), LDL-C (68.27 mg/dl), HDL-C (27 mg/dl) and total lipid (424.76 mg/dl) in comparison to controls, indicating hypolipidemia in patients. The MELD score indicated mild prognostic values of the hepatic function for the study group. The result of total fatty acid composition of HBV-cirrhotic patients with comparison of control subjects reveals that palmitic (24.54 g/100 g) and palmitoleic acid (4.65 g/100 g) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher whereas eicosatrienoic (0.09 g/100 g), arachidonic (3.57 g/100 g), linoleic (22.75 g/100 g) and α-linolenic acid (0.12 g/100 g) were significantly lower. Marker for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD = Δ9-desaturase) activity i.e. palmitoleic: palmitic (0.2) and oleic: stearic acid (1.5) ratios, originated higher in HBV-cirrhotic patients, while PUFA: SFA (0.6) was lower in HBV-cirrhosis patients as compared with control subjects. The serum SFA and MUFA were increased while PUFA were reduced in both total and free form. Conclusion: Present study concluded that hypolipidemia observed in HBV-cirrhosis patients, MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival and alteration in fatty acid composition, possibly due to impairment in fatty acid metabolism by enzymatic elongation and desaturation. © 2017 The Author(s)."

2-s2.0-85014415620,"Background: Prostaglandin (PG)E2 accumulates in inflamed periodontal tissue and induces receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-RANK-osteoprotegerin (OPG) signaling associated with bone resorption. Although oral epithelial cells maintain tissue homeostasis, the role of these cells in RANKL regulation remains unknown. Methods: To mimic an inflamed condition, RANKL upregulation in human mandibular osteoblast-like cells (HMOBs) were stimulated with PGE2. Effect of recombinant human interferon (IFN)-g or epithelialderived IFN-g in constitutively released or Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (PgLPS)-stimulated epithelial supernatant was investigated in HMOBs. Some HMOBs were pretreated with an anti-IFN-g antibody before PGE2 stimulation. THP-1 human monocytes and HMOBs were cocultured in a transwell system to investigate RANKL-driven THP-1 osteoclastic activity. Results: PGE2 significantly increased RANKL messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in HMOBs in a dosedependent manner, while OPG protein remained similar to baseline. Epithelial cells constitutively released IFN-g, which was substantially increased by PgLPS. HMOBs treated with epithelial supernatant or recombinant IFN-g, concurrently with PGE2 stimulation, reduced RANKL, but not OPG, expression. In contrast, anti- IFN-g antibody reversed the effect of epithelial mediators on RANKL expression. When cocultured with THP- 1, RANKL released by PGE2-stimulated HMOBs is adequate to drive THP-1 differentiation as osteoclastogenic gene expression and bone resorption pit are increased. However, recombinant IFN-g, or IFN-g derived from oral epithelial cells, suppressed RANKL expression at both the mRNA and protein level, resulting in decreased THP-1-derived osteoclastic activity. Conclusion: Oral epithelial cells interact with HMOBs by releasing IFN-g to regulate RANKL expression and contribute to osteoclastogenesis."

Based on Fourier transform infrared spectra, the epoxide content of ENR in the nanocomposites was about 32.5-33.2 mole%. Accordingly, the products were referred to ENR30/MWCNT nanocomposites. The curing characteristics, mechanical properties (tensile properties, tear strength, and hardness), glass transition temperature (T g), thermal stability, and oil resistance of these in situ ENR30/MWCNT nanocomposites were investigated and compared with NR and neat ENR30. The results showed that the scorch and cure times of ENR30/MWCNT nanocomposites were the longest followed by NR and ENR30. The incorporation of an appropriate amount of MWCNTs into the in situ epoxidation apparently improved the properties of NR. Among them, the nanocomposites filled with 2 phr MWCNTs exhibited the highest mechanical properties, T g, thermal stability, and oil resistance. The mechanical properties of the in situ nanocomposites were also compared with those of the control nanocomposites prepared by adding MWCNTs directly in the prepared ENR30 latex.

2-s2.0-85012300554,"In this paper we present petrographic and geochemical data of sulfate mineral deposits in northeast Nakhon Sawan, central Thailand, and provide new constraints on their age. The deposits are made up mainly of strongly deformed nodular and massive gypsum in the upper part, and less deformed layered anhydrite in the lower part. They are intruded by andesitic dikes that contain Middle Triassic zircons (ca 240 Ma). These dikes are probably part of the regional magmatic activity of the Sukhothai Arc during the Early to Middle Triassic. Sulfur (δ34S) and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopic compositions of the sulfates range from 15.86 ‰ to 16.26 ‰ and from 0.70810 to 0.70817, respectively. Comparisons with the Phanerozoic seawater isotopic evolution curve indicate that those values are best explained by precipitation of the sulfates from Carboniferous seawater, in particular seawater of late Mississippian age (ca 326 Ma), and this would be consistent with previous studies of calcareous fossils in the limestones that crop out around this site. Our interpretation is that evaporitic gypsum was originally precipitated from hypersaline seawater on a shallow lagoon or shelf on the Khao Khwang Platform during the Serpukhovian, and that this gypsum changed to anhydrite during early burial. The anhydrite was then cut by andesitic dikes during the Middle Triassic, and more recently the upper part of which was rehydrated during exhumation to form secondary gypsum near the surface. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the proportion of patients achieving target ATV trough concentration (Ctrough) with the standard ATV/r dose of 300/100 mg and a low dose of 200/100 mg once daily (OD). A total of 127 Thai HIV-infected patients were included in this study. One random blood sample was collected to determine ATV and RTV concentrations at each clinic visit from 100 patients. Intensive data from 27 patients enrolled in previous studies were also included. Data were analysed using the non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination and absorption lag time best described the data. The population mean clearance of ATV/r was 4.93 L/h in female patients and was 28.7% higher in male patients. Simulation results showed a higher proportion of patients achieving ATV Ctrough within the target range with ATV/r 200/100 mg compared with 300/100 mg. The 200/100 mg OD dose of ATV/r provides adequate ATV exposure in Thai HIV-infected patients. Therefore, a lower dose of ATV/r should be considered for Thai and Asian populations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy"
2-s2.0-85014456686,"In limited-resource settings, prediabetes and diabetes care demand efficient Spatial Care Paths and effective geospatial optimization of medical services upstream to avoid the economic penalties of untold patient complications downstream. Clever HbA1c technologies placed at the leading edge of primary care in health care small-world networks will improve patient care where multifactorial impediments are identified by facilitation thresholds. We illustrate how to formulate facilitation thresholds and then actuate changes that will solve problems generating the threshold phenomena. It is no longer a question of whether point-of-care HbA1c should be used, in view of numerous studies showing its benefits that we summarize, but instead one of how to effectively design, implement, integrate, and optimize strategies that serve underserved populations. In parallel, professional oversight for HbA1c interferences and variants accompanied by laboratory evaluation will help optimize diagnosis and monitoring. Aerial drones, which currently are used to deliver blood, vaccines, and drugs to inaccessible rural settings, could transport specimens for detailed HbA1c evaluations. By taking advantage of strategic intelligence and moving to primary care, the flow of knowledge emanating directly from patients will help public health nurses, primary care staff, and multidisciplinary physicians, some working via telemedicine, to proactively and preemptively reduce diabetes complications by means of evidence-based, cost-effective decision making closer to patient homes. Innovative monitoring and treatment will fulfill expectations for high-quality efficient personalized care, even self-monitoring essential to the management of a chronic condition, thus transforming standards of care to appropriately embrace and empower point-of-care culture. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-85012240026,"Sediment records left by coastal hazards (e.g. tsunami and/or storms) may shed light on the sedimentary and hydrodynamic processes happening during such events. Modern onshore and offshore sediment samples were compared with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, three palaeotsunami and a 2007 storm deposit from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, to determine provenance relationships between these coastal overwash deposits. Sedimentological and stratigraphic characteristics are generally inadequate to discriminate tsunami and storm deposits so a statistical approach (including cluster analysis, principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis) was used based on grain size, mineralogy and trace element geochemistry. The mineral content and trace element geochemistry are statistically inadequate to distinguish the provenance of the modern storm and tsunami deposits at this site, but the mean grain size can potentially discriminate these overwash deposits. The 2007 storm surge deposits were most likely sourced from the onshore sediment environment whereas all four tsunami units statistically differ from each other indicating diverse sediment sources. Our statistical analyses suggest that the 2004 tsunami deposit was mainly derived from nearshore marine sediments. The uppermost palaeotsunami deposit was possibly derived from both onshore and nearshore materials while the lower palaeotsunami deposits showed no clear evidence of their sediment sources. Such complexity raises questions about the origin of the sediments in the tsunami and storm deposits and strongly suggests that local context and palaeogeography are important aspects that cannot be ignored in tsunami provenance studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85010297635,"Background: In transfusion-dependent anaemias, while absolute serum ferritin levels broadly correlate with liver iron concentration (LIC), relationships between trends in these variables are unclear. These relationships are important because serum ferritin changes are often used to adjust or switch chelation regimens when liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unavailable. Objectives and methods: This post hoc analysis of the EPIC study compared serum ferritin and LIC in 317 patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia before and after 1 yr of deferasirox. Results: Serum ferritin responses (decreases) occurred in 73% of patients, 80% of whom also have decreased LIC. However, 52% of patients without a serum ferritin response did decrease LIC and by >1 mg Fe/g dw (median 3.9) in 77% of cases. Absolute serum ferritin and LIC values correlated significantly only when serum ferritin was <4000 ng/mL (r = 0.59; P < 0.0001) and not at higher levels (≥4000 ng/mL; r = 0.19). Serum ferritin response was accompanied by decreased LIC in 89% and 70% of cases when serum ferritin was <4000 or ≥4000 ng/mL, respectively. Conclusions: As serum ferritin non−response was associated with LIC decrease in over half of patients, use of liver MRI may be particularly useful for differentiating true from apparent non-responders to deferasirox based on serum ferritin trends alone. © 2016 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85010830926,"The aim of this study was to determine the effects of daily ranges and maximum ambient temperatures, and other risk factors on reproductive failure of Landrace (L) and Yorkshire (Y) sows under an open-house system in Thailand. Daily ambient temperatures were added to information on 35,579 litters from 5929 L sows and 1057 Y sows from three commercial herds. The average daily temperature ranges (ADT) and the average daily maximum temperatures (PEAK) in three gestation periods from the 35th day of gestation to parturition were classified. The considered reproductive failure traits were the occurrences of mummified fetuses (MM), stillborn piglets (STB), and piglet death losses (PDL) and an indicator trait for number of piglets born alive below the population mean (LBA). A multiple logistic regression model included farrowing herd-year-season (HYS), breed group of sow (BG), parity group (PAR), number of total piglets born (NTB), ADT1, ADT2, ADT3, PEAK1, PEAK2, and PEAK3 as fixed effects, while random effects were animal, repeated observations, and residual. Yorkshire sows had a higher occurrence of LBA than L sows (P = 0.01). The second to fifth parities sows had lower reproductive failures than other parities. The NTB regression coefficients of log-odds were positive (P < 0.01) for all traits. Narrower ranges of ADT3 increased the occurrence of MM, STB, and PDL (P < 0.01), while higher PEAK3 increased the occurrence of MM, STB, PDL, and LBA (P < 0.001). To reduce the risk of reproductive failures, particularly late in gestation, producers would need to closely monitor their temperature management strategies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Herein, the function of LvA2M from Litopenaeus vannamei on the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system is reported. The recombinant (r)LvA2M produced strongly and specifically inhibited trypsin and the PO activity in shrimp plasma in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing of LvA2M led to an increase in the PO activity in shrimp plasma although the expression of proPO-associated genes, proPO-activating enzyme (PPAE) and prophenoloxidase (proPO) but not the proPO-activating factor (PPAF) was down-regulated. In Vibrio parahaemolyticus AHPND-infected shrimp, the LvA2M activity was suppressed in an early phase of infection while the PO activity was increased. Thus, the proPO-activating system was regulated by the LvA2M. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

The MELGA included amplification of the Pfg377 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-conjugated forward primer and biotinylated reverse primer, followed by post-analytical process using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (SA). The complexes of MELGA product were incubated with the peroxidase substrate and hydrogen peroxide to produce the signal for colorimetric measurement. Altogether, the MELGA technique provided a highly sensitive and specific detection at 1 P. falciparum gametocyte/µL, which was more efficient than that of microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Additionally, the MELGA could detect target gene at femtogram level, which was greater sensitive than the conventional PCR, nested PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).

2-s2.0-85010874962,"Lime mud, the industrial waste from pulp and paper mills, was used as a raw material for preparing calcium oxide (CaO)-based catalysts. Lime mud was heated at 1000 °C to transform it into active CaO and then modified by adding 5 wt% Fe or Ni (as nitrates) using the wet impregnation method and calcining to form the Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts. The fast pyrolysis of Jatropha residues to bio-oil with no catalyst and with the derived CaO, Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts was studied using an analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS at 500 °C at a biomass: catalyst ratio of 1:1 and 1:5. A Jatropha residue: catalyst ratio of 1:5 was more optimal for enhancing aliphatic hydrocarbon production and decreasing the amount of oxygenated and N-containing compounds. The presence of the CaO catalyst completely eliminated the undesirable acids and sugars in the bio-oil, significantly decreased N-containing compounds and considerably promoted the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons up to 37.3%. The Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts further increased the selectivity for aliphatic hydrocarbons, and reduced aldehyde formation compared to with CaO, with Ni/CaO being the best catalyst for hydrocarbon selectivity (47.5%). Overall, these CaO-based catalysts derived from industrial lime mud waste can be used for catalytic fast pyrolysis applications. © 2017"

Filler injection into the forehead without precise knowledge of its vascular topography poses a risk of severe complications. Methods: Twenty hemifaces from 11 cadavers were dissected. Results: Based on the presence of the deep branch of the supratrochlear artery, two main arterial distribution patterns of the forehead were observed. Type I (deep branch of the supratrochlear artery-present pattern) was classified into two subtypes: Type Ia, in which the layer superficial to the frontalis was supplied medially by the superficial branch of the supratrochlear artery and laterally by the superficial branch of the supraorbital artery, and the deep branch of the supratrochlear artery and the deep branch of the supraorbital artery were distributed deep to the frontalis; and type Ib, in which the layer superficial to the frontalis was supplied by the superficial branch of the supratrochlear artery and the superficial branch of the supraorbital artery in addition to the central artery or the paracentral artery, and the layer deep to the frontalis was supplied the same with type Ia. For type II (deep branch of the supratrochlear artery-Absent pattern), the layer superficial to the frontalis was supplied the same with type Ia; only the deep branch of the supraorbital artery supplied the layer deep to the frontalis.

2-s2.0-85008485158,"The oxidative dissolution of pyrite is an important process in the redox recycling of iron (Fe) and is well-known for its role in the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), which is considered as the most serious and widespread problem after the closure of mines and mineral processing operations. Because this process requires the movement of electrons, common metal oxides in nature that have either semiconducting (e.g., hematite) or insulating (e.g., alumina) properties may have strong effects on it. In this study, changes in the electrochemical behavior of pyrite in the presence of hematite and alumina were investigated. Results showed that the formation of surface-bound species directly influenced the anodic and cathodic half-cell reactions as well as the transfer of electrons between these sites. Pyrite pretreated in the air became anodically more reactive than that pretreated in oxygenated water, but the type of oxidizing media had little effect on the cathodic half-cell reaction. The presence of hematite and alumina during pretreatment also had strong effects on the electrochemical properties of pyrite. Chronoamperometry measurements suggest that hematite and alumina enhanced the anodic half-cell reaction but suppressed the cathodic half-cell reaction of pyrite oxidation. Increased anodic half-cell reaction in the presence of hematite could be attributed to electron “bridging” and catalytic effects of this mineral. In contrast, the effects of alumina on the anodic half-cell reaction were indirect and could be explained by the formation of Fe3+-oxyhydroxide surface species during pretreatment. Suppression of the cathodic half-cell reaction by both minerals was attributed to their “protective” effect on cathodic sites. Our results also point to the cathodic half-cell reaction as the rate determining-step of the overall oxidative dissolution process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85008512774,"De-oiled Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata seed waste (PPW) is produced in large amounts after the oil extraction process, but still contains 20% (w/w) oil residues. These raw wastes are of no value and consist of toxic compounds, such as karanjin and di-ketone pongamol, with an overall composition of 45–51% carbon and 5–7% hydrogen and 91% combustible compounds, including fixed carbon and volatile matter. The conversion of PPW to biofuel via pyrolysis is one potential use. Fast pyrolysis of PPW was performed at 400, 500 and 600 °C in a micro-batch pyrolyzer interfaced with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). However, the pyrolytic products contained a high level of oxygenated- (34.1–66.5%) and nitrogenated-compounds, giving poor fuel properties, such as a high acidity and viscosity. Oxygenated compounds were mainly carboxylic acids, ketones, alcohols and esters. The introduction of the zeolite (USY) catalyst into the pyrolysis of PPW improve the pyrolytic liquid properties. The oxygenated compounds underwent undergoing decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydration reactions and further conversion to aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis at 500 °C of small sized PPW particles (125–425 μm) at a PPW: USY ratio of 1:5 gave the highest hydrocarbon yield (99.0%). The selectivity for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 500 °C was increased from 4.7–17.4% to 52.5–56.5% when the biomass: catalyst ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1:5. Moreover, the USY catalyst promoted carbon chain scission producing shorter hydrocarbons (C5–12), which was enhanced by the decarboxylation and dealkylation of the alkylated oxygenated compounds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Generally, the average PAH concentrations detected in King George Terrestrial Soils (KGS) were appreciably lower than those of World Marine Sediments (WMS) and World Terrestrial Soils (WTS), highlighting the fact that Antarctica is one of the most pristine continents in the world. The total concentrations of twelve probably carcinogenic PAHs (ΣPAHs: a sum of Phe, An, Fluo, Pyr, B[a]A, Chry, B[b]F, B[k]F, B[a]P, Ind, D[a,h]A and B[g,h,i]P) were 3.21 ± 1.62 ng g−1, 5749 ± 4576 ng g−1, and 257,496 ± 291,268 ng g−1, for KGS, WMS and WTS, respectively. In spite of the fact that KGS has extremely low ΣPAHs in comparison with others, the percentage contribution of Phe is exceedingly high with the value of 50%. By assuming that incidental ingestion and dermal contact are two major exposure pathways responsible for the adverse human health effects, the cancer and non-cancer risks from environmental exposure to PAHs were carefully evaluated based on the “Role of the Baseline Risk Assessment in Superfund Remedy Selection Decisions” memorandum provided by US-EPA. The logarithms of cancer risk levels of PAH contents in KGS varied from −11.1 to −7.18 with an average of −7.96 ± 7.73, which is 1790 times and 80,176 times lower than that of WMS and WTS, respectively.

The recycling of these wastes is an alternative way to solve the problem of polymeric waste management. Thermal/catalytic degradation (pyrolysis) of these wastes is of interest for liquid fuel production. In this work, rubber waste collected from the bicycle brake industry was used as the feedstock for pyrolysis for liquid fuel production. Three HZSM-5 zeolites, synthesized from the conventional hydrothermal method (CV-HZSM-5), Ni loaded HZSM-5 (Ni-HZSM-5) and HZSM-5 derived from fly ash (FA-HZSM-5), were examined for their catalytic performance in the fast pyrolysis of rubber waste using analytical gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C with different rubber: catalyst weight ratios (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10). Increasing the catalyst content remarkably enhanced the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and decreased the non-aromatic fractions drastically, and was optimal at a rubber: catalyst ratio of 1:5 yielding 80.8–95.9% aromatic and 2.8–18.7% aliphatic hydrocarbon products and only approximately 2% oxygenates and nitrogenates. The aromatic selectivity of the catalysts was ranked in the order of CV-HZSM5 > Ni-HZSM-5 > FA-HZSM5. Overall, the three HZSM-5 catalysts showed a superior catalytic performance for upgrading pyrolytic vapours from rubber wastes in terms of enhancing the aromatic production, especially benzene, toluene and xylene compounds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Various operating parameters were studied such as solvent/algae ratio, catalyst addition, water addition, temperature and reaction time on the direct transesterification of Botryococcus sp. with and without ultrasound. The maximum yield, 88% methyl esters (w/w of oil) was achieved in 4 h with ultrasound treatment under optimum conditions, compared to a maximum yield of 78% methyl esters (w/w of oil), after 36 h without ultrasound. Under optimum conditions, the transesterification of Botryococcus sp. oil with dimethyl carbonate produced 2.7% glycerol carbonate and 5.7% glycerol dicarbonate (w/w of oil) with an added benefit of very low free glycerol content.

2-s2.0-85005963657,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic haemolytic disorder. Most persons with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic, but exposure to oxidant drugs, such as the anti-malarial drug primaquine, may induce haemolysis, which is commonly found in Asian countries. A reliable test is necessary for diagnosing the deficiency to prevent an acute haemolytic crisis. This study proposes a novel quantitative method to detect G6PD deficiency using paper-based analytical devices (G6PDD-PAD). Wax printing was utilized for fabricating circular reaction zone patterns in paper. The colorimetric assay is based on the formation of formazan via a reduction of tetra-nitro blue tetrazolium (TNBT) by the G6PD enzyme on G6PDD-PAD. Detection was achieved by capturing the colour using a desktop scanner and the colour intensity was analysed with Adobe Photoshop C56. The results showed that the G6PD activity analysed by G6PDD-PAD was highly correlated with the standard biochemical assay (SBA) (r2=0.87, p<0.01). Moreover, good agreement by Bland-Altman bias plot was demonstrated between G6PDD-PAD and the SBA (mean bias 1.4 IU/gHb). The detection limit was 0 IU/gHb of G6PD activity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using G6PDD-PAD. This simple, low-cost test ($0.1/test) should be useful for diagnosing G6PD deficiency in resource-limited settings. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Then, HDTMS-silica/styrene and acrylonitrile mixture was fed into a polybutadiene latex reactor. Following that, graft copolymerization was carried out using persulfate initiator at temperature of 65 °C for 3.5 h. Thus obtained Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene rubber containing HDTMS-silica was melt extruded with styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) to prepare ABS nanocomposite compound. Mechanical properties of ABS nanocomposite compounds were evaluated. It was found that all of HDTMS : SiO2 wt ratios produced hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles exhibiting good dispersibility in toluene test. In fact, 3 : 1 HDTMS : SiO2 showed the complete hydrophobicity modification, judged by the absence of silanol absorption band. However, the optimum mechanical properties were achieved at 2 wt% loading of 2 : 1 HDTMS: SiO2. Below 2 : 1 ratio, the HDTMS ratio was not enough to obtain the fully hydrophobic surface modification. Above 2 : 1 ratio, the excessive HDTMS ratio led to a decrease in SiO2 content judged by Si EDX mapping, causing a gradual decrease in its energy absorption and reinforcement performance. In case of 2 : 1 HDTMS : SiO2, optimum mechanical properties were achievable at 2 wt% HDTMS-SiO2 loading, resulting from the optimum dispersibility of HDTMS-SiO2 nanoparticles. Further increase in HDTMS-SiO2 loading resulted in a reverse effect due to agglomeration problem.

2-s2.0-85001863240,"A biomarker-based PCR amplification method has been proved to be an effective tool for rapid and accurate detection of Listeria contamination in food factories. However, the current biomarkers (such as iap, hly genes) used for the detection of Listeria have a problem of detection efficiency for some Listeria species, including 7 recently recognized species. Therefore, in this study, a new comprehensive biomarker was developed for the effective detection of all Listeria species. The study employed a novel in-silico scheme to explore and characterize the alternative biomarkers. Biomarker BE-LisAll was identified against 34 Listeria and over 2700 other bacterial complete genomes by in-silico scheme. Specificity of biomarker BE-LisAll was then evaluated with 17 different Listeria species and 58 non-Listeria bacteria isolates. The result showed 100% specificity to Listeria species, and the biomarker could differentiate Listeria species from a variety of non-Listeria bacteria. Finally, the PCR amplification with BE-LisAll was compared with the conventional culture method for detection of Listeria spp. using 60 swab samples collected from a food-processing factory to verify the biomarker's applicability. The result demonstrated 100% correspondence to the results of the conventional culture method. The BE-LisAll biomarker-based PCR amplification is presented for rapid and comprehensive detection of all Listeria species with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity. It is hoped that commercial food processing industries are able to employ this developed biomarker as a Listeria-detection tool in their factories to prevent or reduce economic losses due to Listeria contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-84994311417,"In this article, we have described the synthesis of nano zinc hydroxide on the surface of precipitated silica via the sol–gel precipitation method. The studied zinc hydroxides have been tested as novel cure activators on the vulcanization of natural rubber. The aim of this paper was to reduce the cure activator level in the vulcanization of natural rubber. Synthesized zinc hydroxides were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscope, X-ray diffraction, and field-emission scanning electron microscope, and the results clearly indicate the formation of nano zinc hydroxide with a plate-like structure on the surface of silica. Curing and tensile properties in the presence of synthesized zinc hydroxides as cure activator were compared with those of conventional zinc oxide as a cure activator on the vulcanization of natural rubber. The curing study indicated that lowering the concentration of zinc hydroxide on the silica surface improves the cure rate index to a large extent and it is greater than 360 % for 0.18 g of zinc hydroxide per gram of silica-accelerated vulcanizates compared with that of conventional 5 g zinc oxide-accelerated vulcanizates. However, lower concentrations of zinc hydroxide form fewer number of cross-links, which merely affects the tensile strength. Considering both curing and mechanical properties, 0.5 g of zinc hydroxide per gram of silica, which was synthesized in this experiment, is the suitable choice for activator for the vulcanization of natural rubber.

2-s2.0-84992143327,"Background: The aim was to compare serum levels of interleukin-6 (SIL6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and joint fluid IL-6 (JIL-6) level between total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that used bone cement (BC group) and antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC group). Materials and methods: Thirty-nine patients (40 TKAs) with a mean age of 69.6 years were non-randomly assigned to the BC or ALBC groups. Samples of SIL6, ESR, and CRP were collected at baseline and at 24 h, 72 h, and 4 weeks after surgery. JIL-6 levels were collected intraoperatively before joint arthrotomy, before finishing the procedure and 24 h after surgery. Postoperative mediator levels were compared with baseline levels within the same group and between groups at each time point. Knee Society Score-knee (KSSK) and Knee Society Score-function (KSSF) scores were evaluated. Results: SIL-6, ESR, and CRP levels were significantly elevated at 24 and 72 h, compared to baseline. Only SIL-6 levels at 72 h in the ALBC group showed a significantly lower level than those in the BC group. JIL-6 levels were not different between groups. There were no significant differences in KSSK or KSSF scores between groups at 4 weeks and the most recent follow-up (1.4 ± 0.6 years) evaluation. No correlations were identified among SIL-6 and JIL-6 levels at 24 and 72 h, and KSSK and KSSF scores at 4 weeks and at the most recent evaluation. Conclusions: ALBC showed a favorable immunomodulatory effect and lower SIL-6 level at 72 h following TKA compared to BC, although functional benefits require further investigation.

2-s2.0-84979544817,"In this study, the seismic quiescence prior to hazardous earthquakes was analyzed along the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone (SASZ). The seismicity data were screened statistically with mainshock earthquakes of Mw ≥ 4.4 reported during 1980–2015 being defined as the completeness database. In order to examine the possibility of using the seismic quiescence stage as a marker of subsequent earthquakes, the seismicity data reported prior to the eight major earthquakes along the SASZ were analyzed for changes in their seismicity rate using the statistical Z test. Iterative tests revealed that Z factors of N = 50 events and T = 2 years were optimal for detecting sudden rate changes such as quiescence and to map these spatially. The observed quiescence periods conformed to the subsequent major earthquake occurrences both spatially and temporally. Using suitable conditions obtained from successive retrospective tests, the seismicity rate changes were then mapped from the most up-to-date seismicity data available. This revealed three areas along the SASZ that might generate a major earthquake in the future: (i) Nicobar Islands (Z = 6.7), (ii) the western offshore side of Sumatra Island (Z = 7.1), and (iii) western Myanmar (Z = 6.7). The performance of a stochastic test using a number of synthetic randomized catalogues indicated these levels of anomalous Z value showed the above anomaly is unlikely due to chance or random fluctuations of the earthquake. Thus, these three areas have a high possibility of generating a strong-to-major earthquake in the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
2-s2.0-84986274537,"Nucleated polylactide (PLA) blend films with various types and contents of nucleating agent were prepared in a twin-screw extruder. The influences of type and level of nucleating agent on the tensile, thermal, and morphological properties of the blend films were investigated. Furthermore, effects of different cooling rates (1–10 °C min−1) on non-isothermal processes and various crystallization temperatures (Tc) (100–125 °C) on isothermal conditions were used to evaluate the crystallization behaviors and kinetics of these films by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and polarized light microscope. Nanoprecipitated calcium carbonate (NPCC) and talc were used as a nucleating agent at different concentrations from 0 to 2 phr. The results showed that the tensile properties, thermal stability, spherulitic morphology, and crystallization behaviors of the nucleated PLA blends significantly depended upon the addition of nucleating agent. Tensile properties of the blends were improved with increasing of nucleating agent contents; in contrast, its thermal stability decreased. These behaviors were similarly observed in both nucleated PLA blends with NPCC and talc. Furthermore, DSC curves revealed that NPCC and talc could be a proficient nucleating agent for PLA, resulting in the increments of Tc, crystallization rate, degree of crystallinity (χc), and spherulitic density of nucleated PLA films. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."
2-s2.0-84984890251,"This paper uses the Bhutan Living Standards Survey 2012 to assess factors that affect the decision to use outpatient care when ill, outpatient utilization choice, and bypassing decision. Our attention is placed on geographical factors because of the unique geographical landscape in Bhutan, which may act as an important barrier for access to care in the country. We further analyze the pattern of multiple healthcare visits of individuals with the same health symptom. The methods employed for this study consist of binary logit and multinomial logit regressions as well as descriptive statistical approach. The results show that living in rural area, longer travel time, and residing in remote area reduce the chance of receiving formal care when ill, and among those who get formal treatment, these factors lead to higher tendency of visiting primary healthcare facilities and less propensity of getting care from secondary and tertiary providers. We also find that people with lower economic status have less access to care than their richer counterparts. By investigating the pattern of multiple outpatient visits, our analysis reveals incidence of bypassing primary care to higher level of care in Bhutan. There is also evidence of moving up to higher level of care during subsequent visits but in general people are very persistent in their provider choice. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-84984802035,"Swine is an economically important livestock, yet pork consumption and close contact with pigs are associated with the risk of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. Limited data on the prevalence of HEV in Southeast Asia have mainly examined farm animals. To investigate the potential zoonotic transmission of HEV from dietary consumption of pork and variety meats (i.e., offal or organ meats), we obtained 1090 liver, 559 pork meat, and 556 intestine samples from fresh markets in the Bangkok metropolitan area between November 2014 and February 2015. The presence of HEV was assessed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Concurrently, 720 bile and 553 fecal samples from a slaughterhouse were also examined. Overall, HEV RNA was found in 0.23 % of the market samples and 3.93 % of the slaughterhouse samples. Fecal and bile samples were more likely to test positive compared to liver, pork, and intestine samples (p < 0.001). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HEV sequences obtained in this study formed a cluster closely related to genotype 3f. Pork and variety meats derived from pigs are commonly sold in fresh markets throughout Southeast Asia. Here, a relatively low HEV prevalence from pork and variety meats sold in Bangkok was found. Additional studies will be required to further assess potential dietary transmission of HEV elsewhere in the region. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

This study investigates the role of B cells in this process, by comparing B-cell responses in allergic patients before and during allergen immunotherapy (AIT) and naturally exposed healthy beekeepers before and during the beekeeping season. Methods: Circulating B cells were characterized by flow cytometry. Phospholipase A2 (PLA)-specific B cells were identified using dual-color staining with fluorescently labeled PLA. Expression of regulatory B-cell-associated surface markers, interleukin-10, chemokine receptors, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain isotypes, was measured. Specific and total IgG1, IgG4, IgA, and IgE from plasma as well as culture supernatants of PLA-specific cells were measured by ELISA. Results: Strikingly, similar responses were observed in allergic patients and beekeepers after venom exposure. Both groups showed increased frequencies of plasmablasts, PLA-specific memory B cells, and IL-10-secreting CD73−CD25+CD71+ BR1 cells. Phospholipase A2-specific IgG4-switched memory B cells expanded after bee venom exposure. Interestingly, PLA-specific B cells showed increased CCR5 expression after high-dose allergen exposure while CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR6, and CCR7 expression remained unaffected. Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed characterization of allergen-specific B cells before and after bee venom tolerance induction. The observed B-cell responses in both venom immunotherapy-treated patients and naturally exposed beekeepers suggest a similar functional immunoregulatory role for B cells in allergen tolerance in both groups. These findings can be investigated in other AIT models to determine their potential as biomarkers of early and successful AIT responses. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This ER fluid, prepared by dispersing the chlorosilane-functionalized starch particles in silicone oil, is considered to be a smart and intelligent material because the state of fluid changes from liquid-like to solid-like very quickly and reversibly under applied external electric fields. The ER behavior of the chain formation was examined using optical microscopy, while flow curves and dynamic moduli were investigated using a rotational rheometer with a Couette geometry under applied electric field strengths. The fluid exhibited typical ER characteristics of shear-dependent yield stress as a function of electric filed strength with a slope of 2.0, following a polarization model. It was also found that its ER performance was well correlated with the fluid’s dielectric characteristics through Cole–Cole plot. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-84970990065,"Class imbalance is a challenging problem that demonstrates the unsatisfactory classification performance of a minority class. A trivial classifier is biased toward minority instances because of their tiny fraction. In this paper, our density function is defined as the distance along the shortest path between each majority instance and a minority-cluster pseudo-centroid in an underlying cluster graph. A short path implies highly overlapping dense minority instances. In contrast, a long path indicates a sparsity of instances. A new under-sampling algorithm is proposed to eliminate majority instances with low distances because these instances are insignificant and obscure the classification boundary in the overlapping region. The results show predictive improvements on a minority class from various classifiers on different UCI datasets. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London."
2-s2.0-84957545994,"Pregnancy and delivery are associated with activation of immune-inflammatory pathways which may prime parturients to develop postnatal depression. There are, however, few data on the associations between immune-inflammatory pathways and prenatal depression and physio-somatic symptoms. This study examined the associations between serum zinc, C-reactive protein (CRP), and haptoglobin at the end of term and prenatal physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, back pain, muscle pain, dyspepsia, obstipation) and prenatal and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Zinc and haptoglobin were significantly lower and CRP increased at the end of term as compared with non-pregnant women. Prenatal depression was predicted by lower zinc and lifetime history of depression, anxiety, and premenstrual tension syndrome (PMS). The latter histories were also significantly and inversely related to lower zinc. The severity of prenatal EDPS, HAMD, BDI, STAI, and physio-somatic symptoms was predicted by fatigue in the first and second trimesters, a positive life history of depression, anxiety, and PMS, and lower zinc and higher CRP. Postnatal depressive symptoms are predicted by prenatal depression, physio-somatic symptoms, zinc and CRP. Prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms have an immune-inflammatory pathophysiology, while postnatal depressive symptoms are highly predicted by prenatal immune activation, prenatal depression, and a lifetime history of depression and PMS. Previous episodes of depression, anxiety disorders, and PMS may prime pregnant females to develop prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms via activated immune pathways. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-84969900695,"Objective: This study investigated the presence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) in older Thais compared with middle-age and younger participants. Background: Antinuclear antibody represents the first step in the diagnostic testing for lupus erythematosus (LE) and other autoimmune diseases. Due to the lack of reference ANA levels in older, middle-age and younger Thais healthy participants, this study will be useful for determining the proper diagnostic and treatment criteria. Methods: There were 28 older (60–76 years), 17 middle-age (41–59 years) and 13 younger (24–40 years) participants in this study. Immunofluorescence was performed to analyse the ANA staining pattern and titre levels in the participants' blood samples. Results: The presence of serum ANA was found in 18 of 28 cases (64.3%), four of 17 (23.5%) and one of 13 cases (7.7%) of the older, middle-age and younger participants, respectively. The difference in the number of serum ANA-positive participants between the older, middle-age and younger groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the ANA positive in older participants presented more than one staining pattern. The speckled pattern was the most commonly detected ANA staining pattern in the older group, being found in 12 cases followed by cytoplasmic pattern (10 cases), homogeneous pattern (nine cases) and nucleolar pattern (five cases). In the middle-age group, the speckled pattern was found in four cases, whereas one younger participant presented a nucleolar pattern. Conclusion: Serum ANA positive was significantly higher in the older group compared with the middle-age and younger groups.

Herein, the recombinant ALFPm3 protein (rALFPm3) exhibited effective antibacterial action against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the causative agent of the new severe emerging disease, early mortality syndrome (EMS) or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) at the minimum inhibitory concentration value of 1.25–5.00 μM. The morphological changes such as bleb formation and cell distortion of V. parahaemoluticus were introduced after rALFPm3 treatment. Furthermore, to control V. parahaemoluticus infection, shrimp were treated with rALFPm3 by immersion and reduction in the cumulative mortality of V. parahaemoluticus-infected Penaeus vannamei was observed. As a potential immunostimulant, the administration of dietary rALFPm3 enhanced the transcript level of five immune-related genes; ALFPm3, haemocyte homoeostasis-associated protein, phagocytosis-activating protein, prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme 1 and cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase. In addition, dietary rALFPm3 increased the shrimp survival after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) injection by >35% compared to the 0% survival for the control group.

2-s2.0-84976878514,"The lipid-based formulations including an oily self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) were developed for the oral delivery of oxyresveratrol (OXYR). Each system was successfully formulated using different optimized compositions and methods. The obtained SMEDDS appeared as a yellow oily liquid, while the SLN and NLC as low viscous suspensions. The physical properties, cytotoxicity, and drug permeability across the Caco-2 monolayer of the different systems were compared. The non-aqueous SMEDDS had about a 13-fold higher drug loading than the lipid nanoparticles. The particle sizes (26.94 ± 0.08 nm) of OXYR-SMEDDS were significantly smaller than that of the NLC and SLN (p < 0.05). Also, a narrow size distribution of the SMEDDS (PDI, 0.073 ± 0.010) was obtained compared to the lipid nanoparticles (PDI, 0.2–0.3). By using the MTT assay, the OXYR-SMEDDS showed a fourfold greater toxicity on the Caco-2 cells than the SLN and NLC containing OXYR. At the non-toxic concentration of 100 μM of OXYR, the SMEDDS and the lipid nanoparticles had 2.5–3-fold enhanced permeability and 1.3–1.8-fold reduced efflux transport compared to the unformulated OXYR (p < 0.05). Practical applications: The improvement of the in vitro oral absorption of the lipid-based formulations resulted from the increased permeability and inhibited efflux mediated mechanisms. These lipid-based systems have raised the possibility of the oral OXYR in treating and preventing some importance diseases in future. In addition, these systems could also be used as a potential carrier for oral delivery of other compounds which are substrates for efflux transporters. However, in vivo studies are needed to further investigate oral drug bioavailability. Moreover, for use as a commercial product, it is necessary to improve the storage stability and the toxicity of the oily SMEDDS. The lipid nanoparticles (SLN and NLC) and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) of oxyresveratrol (OXYR) were produced using different compositions and methods. The appearance and characteristics of the lipid-based systems were different. However, all of three lipid-based formulations significantly improved intestinal permeability and reduced efflux transport of OXYR. Therefore, these systems could be used as a potential carrier for oral delivery of OXYR or other compounds which are substrates for efflux transporters. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2-s2.0-84929430245,"Because religious piety induces individuals to be more honest and risk averse, it makes managers less likely to exploit shareholders, thereby mitigating the agency conflict and potentially influencing governance arrangements. We exploit the variation in religious piety across the U.S. counties and investigate the effect of religious piety on anti-takeover provisions. Our results show that religious piety substitutes for corporate governance in alleviating the agency conflict. Effective governance is less necessary for firm with strong religious piety. As a result, religious piety leads to weaker governance, as indicated by more anti-takeover defenses. We exploit historical religious piety as far back as 1952 as our instrumental variable. Religious piety from the distant past is unlikely correlated with current corporate governance directly, except through contemporaneous religious piety. Our instrumental variable analysis, which is far less vulnerable to endogeneity, corroborates the conclusion. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

In this paper, the solubility behavior of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA, in various solvents (1,4-dioxane, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), toluene and water) at low temperatures ranging from 303.15 to 348.15 K, has been studied. From the experimental data, it was found that the solubility of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA increased when temperature increased. In addition, it was found that surface tension and polarity index were strongly dependent on the solubility of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA. The solubility of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA is in the following sequence, MIBK,4-Dioxane, toluene and water. To conclude the experimental data, thermodynamic models such as the polynomial empirical, the Van't Hoff, modified Apelblat, the semi-empirical Buchowski–Ksiazczak, the Wilson and the UNIQUAC were investigated. The Wilson model proved to be the most suitable for predicting the solubility behavior of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA with temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were also investigated. Hence, it was noted that the dissolution process of 2-MBT-CHA and 2-MBT-TBA in investigated solvents is endothermic and spontaneous.

2-s2.0-85013892035,"The chemical investigation of the EtOAc extract of Lobaria orientalis collected in the southwestern part of Central Vietnam led to the isolation of new β-orcinol depsidones, lobarientalones A and B (1 and 2), and diphenyl ethers, lobariethers A-E (3-7). These types of structures are often reported in different lichen species, but the absolute configuration of the stereogenic acetal center has not been defined. This is the first assessment of the (1S) absolute configuration of the stereogenic acetal center using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopic data and by comparison with the ECD data of analogous compounds. Based on the co-occurrence of the depsidones, 1,10-di-O-methylstictic acid (8) and (1-2), and diphenyl ethers (3-7), a plausible biosynthesis route toward 1-8 is proposed. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy."
2-s2.0-85014421025,"Background: Identification of bacterial pathogens in endophthalmitis is important to inform antibiotic selection and treatment decisions. Hemoculture bottles and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have been proposed to offer good detection sensitivity. This study compared the sensitivity and accuracy of a blood culture system, a PCR approach, and conventional culture methods for identification of causative bacteria in cases of acute endophthalmitis. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with a diagnosis of presumed acute bacterial endophthalmitis who underwent vitreous specimen collection at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were enrolled in this study. Forty-one specimens were collected. Each specimen was divided into three parts, and each part was analyzed using one of three microbial identification techniques: conventional plate culture, blood culture, and polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The results of the three methods were then compared. Results: Bacteria were identified in 15 of the 41 specimens (36.5%). Five (12.2%) specimens were positive by conventional culture methods, 11 (26.8%) were positive by hemoculture, and 11 (26.8%) were positive by PCR. Cohen's kappa analysis revealed p-values for conventional methods vs. hemoculture, conventional methods vs. PCR, and hemoculture vs. PCR of 0.057, 0.33, and 0.009, respectively. Higher detection rates of Enterococcus faecalis were observed for hemoculture and PCR than for conventional methods. Conclusions: Blood culture bottles and PCR detection may facilitate bacterial identification in cases of presumed acute endophthalmitis. These techniques should be used in addition to conventional plate culture methods because they provide a greater degree of sensitivity than conventional plate culture alone for the detection of specific microorganisms such as E. faecalis.

2-s2.0-85008692987,"Background Nocturnal hypokinesia is a common night-time symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is still little understanding of the nature, and variations of severity of this symptom. Objectives To evaluate the severity of nocturnal hypokinesia and sleep positions in PD patients using multisite wearable sensors. Methods Nocturnal parameters and sleep positions in 18 PD couples were assessed and compared using wearable sensors (limbs and trunk) for one night in their homes. Nocturnal parameters included number, velocity, acceleration, degree, limb movements and the number of times they got out of bed. Results PD patients had significantly fewer episodes of turns in bed than their spouses (p = 0.043), which was associated with significantly slower speed (p = 0.005), acceleration (p = 0.005) and fewer degrees (p = 0.017). When we split the night into the first and second half, significant findings were mainly demonstrated in the second half of the night, including significantly fewer turns (p = 0.02) with smaller degrees (p = 0.017), slower speed (p = 0.005) and acceleration (p = 0.007). No significant differences in these parameters were shown in the first half of the night except for smaller degrees of turn in bed in PD patients (p = 0.028) and slower acceleration (p = 0.037). In addition, PD patients spent significantly more time in a supine position compared to their spouses (p = 0.031) with significantly less time in a prone position (p = 0.041). Conclusion Nocturnal hypokinesia gets worse as the night progresses. Treatment of nocturnal hypokinesia should aim at providing a continuous dopaminergic delivery that can achieve a sustained therapeutic level of dopamine throughout the night. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85008198166,"Pyrite is one of the most common and geochemically important sulfide minerals in nature because of its role in the redox recycling of iron (Fe). It is also the primary cause of acid mine drainage (AMD) that is considered as a serious and widespread problem facing the mining and mineral processing industries. In the environment, pyrite oxidation occurs in the presence of ubiquitous metal oxides, but the roles that they play in this process remain largely unknown. This study evaluates the effects of hematite (α-Fe2O3) and alumina (α-Al2O3) on pyrite oxidation by batch-reactor type experiments, surface-sensitive characterization of the oxidation layer and thermodynamic/kinetic modeling calculations. In the presence of hematite, dissolved sulfur (S) concentration dramatically decreased independent of the pH, and the formation of intermediate sulfoxy anionic species on the surface of pyrite was retarded. These results indicate that hematite minimized the overall extent of pyrite oxidation, but the kinetic model could not explain how this suppression occurred. In contrast, pyrite oxidation was enhanced in the alumina suspension as suggested by the higher dissolved S concentration and stronger infrared (IR) absorption bands of surface-bound oxidation products. Based on the kinetic model, alumina enhanced the oxidative dissolution of pyrite because of its strong acid buffering capacity, which increased the suspension pH. The higher pH values increased the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by dissolved O2 (DO) that enhanced the overall oxidative dissolution kinetics of pyrite. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85008233322,"Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of tailings from a gold mine in northeastern Thailand were investigated in relation to acid mine drainage (AMD) and the release potentials of toxic elements. The tailings can be divided into upper tailings and lower tailings. The upper tailings usually contain pyrrhotite, pyrite ± chalcopyrite, calcite, quartz, andradite and diopside. The lower tailings mainly contain goethite, quartz, chlorite, muscovite, calcite and hematite ± pyrrhotite. These assemblages clearly relate to the original types of gold deposit prior to mining and mineral processing. The upper tailings are defined as potential acid forming (PAF), whereas the lower tailings are classified as non-acid forming (NAF). Regarding heavy metals, apart from high Mn level, the other heavy metals appear to have low concentrations in the upper tailings. On the other hand, the lower tailings contain high contents of As, Cu and Pb, which appear to be higher than the National Total Threshold Limit Concentrations. Goethite, the main mineral assemblage in the lower tailings, reveals characteristic of arsenic adsorbent. As a result, the tailing pond is recommended to be covered to prevent the oxidizing processes of the upper tailings; otherwise, AMD generation may take place soon after the mine closure. Land reclamation and monitoring plans must be planned very well and carried out with great care since arsenic contamination has been reported in steam water close to the tailing dam. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2-s2.0-85013399115,"CD8+ T cells play a critical role in controlling HIV viremia and could be important in reducing HIV-infected cells in approaches to eradicate HIV. The simian immunodeficiency virus model provided the proof of concept for a CD8+ T cell-mediated reservoir clearance but showed conflicting evidence on the role of these cells to eliminate HIV-infected cells. In humans, HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses have not been associated with a reduction of the HIV-infected cell pool in vivo. We studied HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in the RV254 cohort of individuals initiating ART in the earliest stages of acute HIV infection (AHI). We showed that the HIV-specific CD8+ T cells generated as early as AHI stages 1 and 2 before peak viremia are delayed in expanding and acquiring effector functions but are endowed with higher memory potential. In contrast, the fully differentiated HIV-specific CD8+ T cells at peak viremia in AHI stage 3 were more prone to apoptosis but were associated with a steeper viral load decrease after ART initiation. Their capacity to persist in vivo after ART initiation correlated with a lower HIV DNA reservoir. These findings demonstrate that HIV-specific CD8+ T cell magnitude and differentiation are delayed in the earliest stages of infection. These results also demonstrate that potent HIV-specific CD8+ T cells contribute to the reduction of the pool of HIV-producing cells and the HIV reservoir seeding in vivo and provide the rationale to design interventions aiming at inducing these potent responses to cure HIV infection. © Copyright The Authors 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science."

A total of 792 patients with stage T1-4N1-3M0 NPC and presented with CNN based on magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score matching method was used to balance treatment arms for baseline characteristics. Eventually, 508 patients were propensity-matched on a 1:1 basis to create two groups (NACT + CCRT and CCRT groups). Survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and differences were compared by using the log-rank test. The 5-year disease specific survival, disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were significantly higher in NACT + CCRT group relative to the matched CCRT group (82.1% vs. 72.5%, P = 0.021; 70.3% vs. 54.1%, P < 0.001; 81.9% vs. 67.3%, P < 0.001, respectively). Although the rates of grade 3-4 leucopenia and mucositis were higher in NACT + CCRT group than CCRT group, compliance with the combined treatment was good and no significant difference was observed between two groups. NACT followed by CCRT was relatively safe and could achieve better survival than CCRT alone in NPC patients with CNN by reducing the risk of death, tumor progression and distant metastasis. © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-85002179227,"The incorporation of proton transfer species into the polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), in most cases, rely on the chemical modification in solution state before casting the membrane, and therefore, the function of proton transfer species is depending on the membrane physicochemical properties. The present work proposes a simple grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto membrane surface to incorporate PEG hydrophilic chains for the function of water and acid molecules absorption. At the same time, the PEG terminated with benzimidazole provides the proton hopping. Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) is cast to obtain a membrane and its surface is further grafted with polymer brushes of PEG containing benzimidazole terminals. The membrane obtained is stable up to 250 °C without degradation indicating the feasibility for high temperature PEMFC. The proton transfer is under the vehicle mechanism in non-humidified condition where the conductivity and water uptake of the membranes are increased when increasing of PEG chain length in combination with the benzimidazole units. The direct surface modification of PEM with polymer brushes is a simple way to enrich the surface with proton transfer species and gaining membrane stability without the problems of phase separation. © 2016"

2-s2.0-85013414300,"We demonstrate the relativistic effects in high-pressure phase transitions of heavy element thallium. The known first phase transition from h.c.p. to f.c.c. is initially investigated by various relativistic levels and exchange-correlation functionals as implemented in FPLO method, as well as scalar relativistic scheme within PAW formalism. The electronic structure calculations are interpreted from the perspective of energetic stability and electronic density of states. The full relativistic scheme (FR) within L(S)DA performs to be the scheme that resembles mostly with experimental results with a transition pressure of 3 GPa. The s-p hybridization and the valence-core overlapping of 6s and 5d states are the primary reasons behind the f.c.c. phase occurrence. A recent proposed phase, i.e., a body-centered tetragonal (b.c.t.) phase, is confirmed with a small distortion from the f.c.c. phase. We have also predicted a reversible b.c.t. †' f.c.c. phase transition at 800 GPa.

The result showed that increasing plasticizer concentration tended to decrease tensile strength (TS), elastic modulus (EM) and oxygen permeability (OP); but increase elongation (%E), solubility, water vapor permeability (WVP) and seal strength. The extent of those changes also depended on starch concentration. Glycerol provided better plasticizer efficiency than sorbitol.

2-s2.0-85007251845,"Measurements of two- and multi-particle angular correlations in pp collisions at s=5,7, and 13TeV are presented as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The data, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0pb−1 (5 TeV), 6.2pb−1 (7 TeV), and 0.7pb−1 (13 TeV), were collected using the CMS detector at the LHC. The second-order (v2) and third-order (v3) azimuthal anisotropy harmonics of unidentified charged particles, as well as v2 of KS 0 and Λ/Λ‾ particles, are extracted from long-range two-particle correlations as functions of particle multiplicity and transverse momentum. For high-multiplicity pp events, a mass ordering is observed for the v2 values of charged hadrons (mostly pions), KS 0, and Λ/Λ‾, with lighter particle species exhibiting a stronger azimuthal anisotropy signal below pT≈2GeV/c. For 13 TeV data, the v2 signals are also extracted from four- and six-particle correlations for the first time in pp collisions, with comparable magnitude to those from two-particle correlations. These observations are similar to those seen in pPb and PbPb collisions, and support the interpretation of a collective origin for the observed long-range correlations in high-multiplicity pp collisions. © 2016 The Author"

No laboratory test can predict the risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) or severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic cellular transplantation (HCT) prior to the onset of GVHD symptoms. METHODS. Patient blood samples on day 7 after HCT were obtained from a multicenter set of 1,287 patients, and 620 samples were assigned to a training set. We measured the concentrations of 4 GVHD biomarkers (ST2, REG3α, TNFR1, and IL-2Rα) and used them to model 6-month NRM using rigorous cross-validation strategies to identify the best algorithm that defined 2 distinct risk groups. We then applied the final algorithm in an independent test set (n = 309) and validation set (n = 358). RESULTS. A 2-biomarker model using ST2 and REG3α concentrations identified patients with a cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM of 28% in the high- risk group and 7% in the low- risk group (P < 0.001). The algorithm performed equally well in the test set (33% vs. 7%, P < 0.001) and the multicenter validation set (26% vs. 10%, P < 0.001). Sixteen percent, 17%, and 20% of patients were at high risk in the training, test, and validation sets, respectively. GVHD-related mortality was greater in high-risk patients (18% vs. 4%, P < 0.001), as was severe gastrointestinal GVHD (17% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). The same algorithm can be successfully adapted to define 3 distinct risk groups at GVHD onset. CONCLUSION. A biomarker algorithm based on a blood sample taken 7 days after HCT can consistently identify a group of patients at high risk for lethal GVHD and NRM. © 2017 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

2-s2.0-85054800259,"Estradiol (E2) inhibits eating behavior in females via activating estrogen receptors (ERs) within the brain. Activation of hindbrain ERαs has been shown to be sufficient to inhibit eating behavioral pattern. To investigate the involvement of hindbrain ERαs in estrogenic control of eating behavior, intracerebroventricular infusion (4th i.c.v.) of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182780 (ICI), was performed in ovariectmized female rats. Significantly lower daily food intake was observed in rats after estradiol benzoate (EB) injections. The effect of EB on food intake was significantly compromised by 4th i.c.v. infusions of both 4 and 8 nM ICI solutions. The results suggest that hindbrain infusions of ICI can significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of E2 on food intake. Importantly, 4th i.c.v. infusions during 12 days exerted no effect per se on eating. Further, there was no difference in the number of ERα immunopositive neurons in the selected hypothalamic nuclei and nucl. tractus solitarius. We conclude that the 4th i.c.v. infusions with ICI attenuated the exogenous estrogenic effect on food intake in ovariectomized rats, and the hindbrain is an important site providing estrogenic control of food intake. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Patients with nondilated collecting systems represent a challenge: The target calix is often difficult to visualize. Here we report pilot study results for retrograde ultrasound contrast injection to aid in percutaneous renal access during ultrasound-guided PCNL. Patients and Methods: From April to July 2016, consecutive patients over the age of 18 years with nondilated collecting systems on preoperative imaging who presented for PCNL were enrolled. B-mode ultrasound imaging was compared with contrast-enhanced mode with simultaneous retrograde injection of Optison™ via an ipsilateral ureteral catheter. Results: Five patients (four males and one female) with renal stones underwent PCNL with retrograde ultrasound contrast injection during the study period. Mean body mass index was 28.3 ± 5.6 kg/m2 and mean stone size was 24.5 ± 12.0 mm. Under B-mode ultrasound, all patients demonstrated nondilated renal collecting systems that appeared as hyperechoic areas, where it was difficult to identify a target calix for puncture. Retrograde contrast injection facilitated delineation of all renal calices initially difficult to visualize under B-mode ultrasound. Renal puncture was then performed effectively in all cases with a mean puncture time of 55.4 ± 44.8 seconds. All PCNL procedures were completed without intraoperative complications and no adverse events related to ultrasound contrast injection occurred. Conclusion: Retrograde ultrasound contrast injection as an aide for renal puncture during PCNL is a feasible technique. By improving visualization of the collecting system, it facilitates needle placement in challenging patients without hydronephrosis.

2-s2.0-85018675395,"Background: Matching supply side of the Internal Medicine (IM) subspecialists to the demand for complex medical care at referral medical centers would lead to more efficient health system management and ultimately optimal clinical outcome. The second decade of the universal health coverage policy in Thailand has raised the awareness on how to reach equitable utilization goals of good quality medical services, while barriers of accession have been removed. More accurate evidence-based human resource planning is timely needed. Objective: To estimate the number of the ten subspecialists in internal medicine (neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist and hepatologist, nephrologist, hematologist, oncologist, rheumatologist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist) needed for complex medical care based on the workload in the year 2013. Material and Method: The present study applied a needs assessment model with evidence-based approach. Claimed data of inpatients in the year 2013 from the three government insurance schemes (the Civil Servant Medical Benefit, the Social Security and the Universal Health Coverage schemes), and out-patient data from Universal Coverage System were used to estimate demand for subspecialists. The Human Resource Working Group of the Royal College of Physicians of Thailand agreed on the conceptual framework to estimate the need for ten subspecialists based on clinical activities of outpatient consultations, inpatient ward rounds and non-operating room procedures on medical cases of respective diagnosis related group with severe and catastrophic comorbidities and complications by the Thai-DRG version 5. Representatives from the Associations of IM subspecialties approved the lists of ICD-10 diagnosis and ICD-9-CM procedure codes specific to each subspecialist care and proposed assumptions on rates of consultations from other specialists. Surveys were done to subspecialists in 6 major provincial clusters and representatives from IM subspecialty Associations asking time spent on main activities of patient care. The number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) subspecialists needed was calculated by multiplying the clinical workloads measured in minutes spent for each activity (ward round, ward work, inpatient and outpatient consultations) to get the total time needed, then divided by the available time for clinical activity of one subspecialist. Results: From 5.9 million inpatient discharges in the year 2013, primary responsibility of patients in respective severe and catastrophic DRGs related to specific subspecialist workloads were summed up for teaching hospitals and regional hospitals ranging from as lowest the 2,849 cases for rheumatology to the highest 24,610 cases for gastroenterology and hepatology. The number of inpatient non-operating room procedures by ICD-9-CM as listed by IM subspecialty Associations ranged from 8 times for endocrinologists to 22,927 times for cardiologists for the whole year. Of ten subspecialists, the estimated numbers of cardiologist, nephrologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist and hepatologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, rheumatologist, hematologist, pulmonologist and infectious disease subspecialist needed at teaching and regional hospitals were 516, 241; 345, 144; 312, 143; 195, 124; 189, 45; 137, 170; 90, 47; 96, 111; 203, 87 and; 129, 44 respectively according to the workload recorded in the year 2013. The forecast FTE found the overall gap of discrepancy at 7 percent. If the distributions of these subspecialists in public and private hospitals were taken into account, the gap of discrepancy in public hospitals increased to 47 percent. Conclusion: The demand-based forecast for the number of subspecialist needed was made possible with assumptions on conceptual framework for case selection, the rates of consultation and time-spent related to activities of patient care. The estimated numbers of subspecialists were anticipated far from optimum since the workload in the year 2013 was derived as a consequence of pre-existing suboptimal infrastructure of healthcare system. In addition, the deficit of subspecialists may increase in the near future when highly efficient, non- or mildly invasive, time-consuming procedures of acute illness increase. Sustainable matching demand and supply of human resource for health needed further validations of these assumptions. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85016048154,"Background: The Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand initiated registry and reporting of anesthesia service incidents and outcomes in 2005. Objectives: The Perianesthetic Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand (PAAd Thai) study aimed to investigate patient, surgical, and anesthetic profiles, and suggest strategies for prevention of adverse events. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted in 22 hospitals across Thailand. Each hospital was invited to report, on an anonymous basis, any perianesthetic adverse incident during 12 months (between January 1 and December 31, 2015). A standardized incident report form was completed to determine the type of incident, and where, when, how, and why it occurred using closed and open-ended questionnaires. Data regarding main anesthetic techniques were also reported monthly. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: For 333,219 cases, 2,206 incident reports with 3,028 critical incidents were reported. The incidents commonly occurred in male patients (52.0%), aged ≤10 y (13.0%) and ≥70 y (18.2%). The incidence of adverse events included cardiac arrest within 24 h (15.5:10,000), death (13.0:10,000), reintubation (11.1:10,000), esophageal intubation (8.5:10,000), difficult intubation (8.0:10,000), and malignant hyperthermia (1:200,000). General, cardiothoracic, neurological, and otorhinolaryngological surgical specialties posed a high risk of incidents. Operating and recovery rooms were common locations for incidents. Conclusion: In the past decade, there were dramatic reductions of perioperative cardiac arrests and difficult intubations. Common factors related to critical incidents were inexperience, emergency, inadequate preanesthetic evaluation, inappropriate decisions, lack of vigilance, and inexperienced assistants. Suggested corrective strategies are compliance with guidelines, additional training, and improvement of supervision and quality assurance."
2-s2.0-85016012452,"Background: Evidence for the impact of health care spending in the area of maternal, newborn and child health (MCH) in developing countries is limited. Objectives: To examine the investment and medical care expenses for MCH under Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Thailand. Methods: A prevention-appraisal-failure (PAF) cost element method was applied. Using a payer perspective, data related to PAF elements of MCH were collected from the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) inpatient claim database, UCS liability claims, the health-budget administration and health resource databases of the Ministry of Public Health, and the population census of The National Statistical Office in fiscal years 2007-2011. The main outcome measures included payments and budgets for MCH at a provincial level. Results: Investment and medical care costs of antenatal care to prevent and manage complications increased from US$7.77 per person per year (PPPY) in 2007 to US$11.69 PPPY in 2011. The payments to support qualityfocused activities ranged from US$0.60 to US$1.19 PPPY, whereas failure costs resulting from postpartum complications and UHC liability claims were US$1.92, 2.24, 2.35, 2.48, and 2.56 PPPY. Univariate regression analyses of year-on-year changes in prevention and appraisal costs for providing MCH and changes in the failure costs showed significant negative associations between 3 of 4 pairs of years Conclusions: Increased year-on-year costs of preventing MCH problems were associated with a reduction in year-on-year costs incurred for correcting problems. Despite increasing trends for all the costs, this finding indicated improvements in allocation of resources to address MCH challenges in Thailand."
2-s2.0-85016500803,"Background: Selecting the cut-off point for the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs is of prime importance. The balance between the test performance for detecting advanced neoplasia and the available colonoscopy resources should be considered. We aimed to identify the optimal cut-off of FIT for advanced neoplasia in order to minimize colonoscopy burden. Methods: We conducted a multi-center study in 6 hospitals from diverse regions of Thailand. Asymptomatic participants, aged 50-75 years, were tested with one-time quantitative FIT (OC-SENSOR, Eiken Chemical Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and all participants underwent colonoscopy. We assessed test performance in detecting advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma and CRC) and measured the burden of colonoscopy with different cut-offs [25 (FIT25), 50 (FIT50), 100 (FIT100), 150 (FIT150), and 200 (FIT200)ng/ml]. Results: Among 1,479 participants, advanced neoplasia and CRC were found in 137 (9.3%) and 14 (0.9%), respectively. From FIT25 to FIT200, the positivity rate decreased from 18% to 4.9%. For advanced neoplasia, an increased cut-off decreased sensitivity from 42.3% to 16.8% but increased specificity from 84.2% to 96.3%. The increased cut-off increased the positive predictive value (PPV) from 21.5% to 31.5%. However, all cut-off points provided a high negative predictive value (NPV) (> 90%). For CRC, the miss rate for FIT25 to FIT 150 was the same (n = 3, 21%), whereas that with FIT200 increased to 35% (n = 5). Conclusions: In a country with limited-colonoscopy resources, using FIT150 may be preferred because it offers both high PPV and NPV for advanced neoplasia detection. It could also decrease colonoscopy workload, while maintaining a CRC miss rate similar to those with lower cut-offs."
2-s2.0-85016010617,"Background: Safety in anesthesia can be improved through monitoring and analysis of anesthetic complications. We conducted the present Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand (PAAd Thai) incident reporting study to determine the current frequency distribution of incidents related to the anesthetic complications, factors contributing to the incidents, and corrective strategies. Objective: To describe the characteristics of the hospitals participating in this study and methods used. Methods: A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in hospitals across Thailand in 2015. The participating hospitals were asked to anonymously report incidents of anesthesia-related adverse events and management. Three peer reviewers reviewed the completed record forms describing the incidents including possible mechanisms, contributing factors, appropriate management, and preventive strategies to achieve agreement by consensus. Results: Twenty-two hospitals across Thailand participated in this study. Fourteen (64%) were nonuniversity (service directed) hospitals, while 8 (36%) were university (academic teaching) hospitals. Most hospitals were involved in residency training and teaching medical students (77%), while just more than half (57%) were involved in training nurse anesthetists. The ratio of anesthesiologists to an operating room was 0.67:1 and the ratio of nurse anesthetists to an operating room was 2.03:1. Conclusion: A critical incident analysis of each reported adverse event is helpful for proposing a corrective or preventive strategy to ameliorate perioperative care and improve patient safety in the Thai health care system."
2-s2.0-85015775357,"Three yeast isolates, G5-5(5)T, G5-9(3) and G5-9(4), were obtained from the sugar cane juice and waste from sugar production plant (Korach Industry Co., Ltd) in Korach province, Thailand. They were found to belong to the same species based on DNA sequence identity of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) and the D1/D2 region of the large subunit rRNA gene (LSU D1/D2). A BLASTn search of the GenBank database revealed they had 93% nucleotide sequence identity to Dekkera bruxellensis for the SSU (1742 bp), but their LSU D1/D2 sequence (572 bp) showed less than 90% identity to all available sequences in the database. Phylogenetic analyses with neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony methods using the aligned LSU D1/D2 and SSU sequences (a total of 2072 positions after removal of gaps) inferred that the three isolates were separated from all known taxa in the Saccharomycetales, and that the neighbouring taxa were species of Dekkera/ Brettanomyces. Physiological and biochemical characters revealed distinct differences between the three isolates and Dekkera/Brettanomyces species, including the ability to assimilate several carbon sources and inability to ferment glucose. Thus, isolates G5-5(5)T, G5-9(3) and G5-9(4) should be assigned to a novel taxon, for which the name Allodekkera sacchari gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is G5-5(5)T (=CBS 14167T=JCM 18455T=TISTR 5950T), with MycoBank number MB815477 (for the genus) and MB817751 (for the species).

2-s2.0-85016446679,"Background: Raising breast cancer awareness is a key strategy to reduce associated mortality. While a paucity of adequately validated instruments for breast cancer awareness is applicable across cultures, even outside the health care setting such instruments have been developed. Objective: This study investigated the validity and psychometric properties of a breast cancer awareness scale in Indonesia (BCAS-I). Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among Indonesian women conveniently selected within three provinces (Yogyakarta, South of Sumatera and East Nusa Tenggara) located in rural-urban areas using stratified random sampling. First, we translated all questionnaires from English to the local language and then back-translated. The third step was to perform psychometric testing of the adapted instrument by establishing internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha score 0.79) and construct validity by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: In the 856 participants who responded (responded rate = 98.28%), the age ranged from 18 to 80 years old (mean = 30, SD = 11). The BCAS-I was shown to have good internal consistency, and CFA demonstrated the model fit data adequately (χ2 = 922.267, df = 515, p < 0.001, comparative fit index = 0.965, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.96, goodness-of-fit index = 0.97, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.97, root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.03 95% confidence interval: 0.027, 0.034). The final version of BCAS-I consists of 33 items across 5 domains that cover most key aspects of breast cancer awareness for this population. Conclusion: The BCAS-I demonstrated good psychometric properties and was found to be valid to provide a measurement of breast cancer awareness in Asian women in general and Indonesian women in particular."
2-s2.0-85014673795,"Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson are presented. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1, 19.7, and 2.3 fb−1 at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, respectively. The search channels target Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson. Upper limits are placed on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to invisible particles, as a function of the assumed production cross sections. The combination of all channels, assuming standard model production, yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction of 0.24 (0.23) at the 95% confidence level.

2-s2.0-85016005249,"Phylogenetic relationships within the genus Leptolalax have been insuiciently resolved, while the relationships of a related genus Leptobrachella with other genera are totally unknown. In order to improve these situations, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships among 19 species of Leptolalax and four species of Leptobrachella based on 2067-2527 bp sequences of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Leptolalax and Leptobrachella formed a clade, in which each of the Bornean Leptolalax, continental Leptolalax, and Leptobrachella formed a clade with unresolved relationships. Within the continental clade, the species from the Malay Peninsula formed a sister clade to the clade of the remaining regions. The species from southern Thailand formed a sister clade to the species from more northern regions. These results suggest conining the name Leptolalax to Bornean species, and reexamining the contents of the name Lalos currently recognized. Pointed digital tips unique to Leptobrachella might have arisen parallelly in ancestral Leptolalax as in Leptobrachium. Absence of species common to both Borneo and the neighboring continent in Leptolalax unlike in many other anuran genera occurring in Borneo, suggests a unique evolutional history of the genus. © 2017 by The Herpetological Society of Japan."
2-s2.0-85013937924,"A search is performed for Higgs-boson-mediated flavor-changing neutral currents in the decays of top quarks. The search is based on proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events in which a top quark pair is produced with one top quark decaying into a charm or up quark and a Higgs boson (H), and the other top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a W boson are selected. The Higgs boson in these events is assumed to subsequently decay into either dibosons or difermions. No significant excess is observed above the expected standard model background, and an upper limit at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching fraction ℬ(t → Hc) of 0.40% and ℬ(t → Hu) of 0.55%, where the expected upper limits are 0.43% and 0.40%, respectively.

2-s2.0-85012994379,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder subluxation is a common secondary impairment of the upper limb following stroke. A range of supportive devices are used in rehabilitation to prevent shoulder subluxation, including hemi-slings and firm supports, such as arm troughs, however, there is little evidence regarding their efficacy. AIM: To determine whether a modified lap-tray during sitting and a triangular sling during standing is more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing shoulder subluxation, pain, contracture and upper limb activity limitation after stroke. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Three inpatient rehabilitation units in Australia and Norway. POPULATION: Forty-six acute stroke survivors within 3 weeks of stroke who were at risk of subluxation. METHODS: The experimental group used a modified lap-tray while sitting and a triangular sling while standing to support the affected arm for four weeks. The control group used a hemi-sling while sitting and standing. The primary outcome was amount of shoulder subluxation on X-ray. Secondary outcomes were upper limb activity, pain and contracture. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in terms of shoulder subluxation (MD -3 mm, 95% CI -8 to 3). There was a trend for the experimental group to develop less pain at rest (MD -0.7 out of 10, 95% CI -2.2 to 0.8) and during shoulder external rotation (MD -1.7 out of 10, 95% CI -3.7 to 0.3) and a trend towards having less contracture of shoulder external rotation (MD -10 deg, 95% CI -22 to 2). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of other contractures and activity of the upper limb. CONCLUSIONS: A lap-tray during sitting combined with a triangular sling during standing is no more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing subluxation, pain, contracture and activity limitation in acute stroke survivors at risk of shoulder subluxation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The use of a lap-tray during sitting and triangular sling during standing is not indicated as an alternative to the hemi-sling to prevent shoulder subluxation in patients after stroke, so alternative strategies with proven efficacy, such as electrical stimulation, should be considered. © 2016 Edizioni Minerva Medica."

2-s2.0-85012930290,"Existing antiangiogenic approaches to treat metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are weakly effectual, prompting further study of tumor angiogenesis in this disease setting. Here, we report a novel role for sulfatase 2 (SULF2) in driving HCC angiogenesis. Sulf2-deficient mice (Sulf2 KO) exhibited resistance to diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC and did not develop metastases like wild-type mice (Sulf2 WT). The smaller and less numerous tumors formed in Sulf2 KO mice exhibited a markedly lower microvascular density. In human HCC cells, SULF2 overexpression increased endothelial proliferation, adhesion, chemotaxis, and tube formation in a paracrine fashion. Mechanistic analyses identified the extracellular matrix protein periostin (POSTN), a ligand of avb3/5 integrins, as an effector protein in SULF2-induced angiogenesis. POSTN silencing in HCC cells attenuated SULF2-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. The TGFb1/SMAD pathway was identified as a critical signaling axis between SULF2 and upregulation of POSTN transcription. In clinical HCC specimens, elevated levels of SULF2 correlated with increased microvascular density, POSTN levels, and relatively poorer patient survival. Together, our findings define an important axis controlling angiogenesis in HCC and a mechanistic foundation for rational drug development. © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research."

An upper limit at 95% confidence level on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction into tau lepton pairs is calculated as a function of the resonance mass. For the sequential standard model, the presence of Z′ bosons decaying into tau lepton pairs is excluded for Z′ masses below 2.1 TeV, extending previous limits for this final state. For the topcolor-assisted technicolor model, which predicts Z′ bosons that preferentially couple to third-generation fermions, Z′ masses below 1.7 TeV are excluded, representing the most stringent limit to date.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85012930132,"Background:Less is known about the effect of screen time and sleep at a younger age on current sleep outcome in infants. Therefore, we examined whether sleep parameter at a younger age and daily exposure of electronic media could predict sleep outcomes in 12-mo-old Thai infants.Methods:There were 208 typically developing infants enrolled since 6 mo old. Each main caregiver completed a sleep questionnaire and was interviewed for the infant's screen exposure at 6 and 12 mo of age. Nighttime sleep latency and sleep duration were calculated. Electronic media and sleep outcomes were analyzed using multiple linear regressions and path analysis.Results:Longer sleep latency at age 12 mo was predicted by longer daily duration of media exposure and longer 6-mo-old sleep latency. Infants who were exposed to electronic media above the median at both ages had longer 12-mo-old nighttime sleep latency compared with those who were exposed to the screen below the median at both ages.Conclusion:Six-month-old nighttime sleep latency and 12-mo-old electronic media exposure could predict 12-mo-old nighttime sleep latency.

2-s2.0-85011914839,"Sericin has been implicated in lower cholesterolemic effect due to its properties with several mechanisms. Mitochondria are one of the most important targets to be affected in high blood cholesterol and glucose conditions. The protective role of sericin on mitochondria remains doubtful. To examine this role, electron microscopic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical studies were performed in a high-cholesterol diet/streptozotocin rat model. The results demonstrated that sericin reduced blood cholesterol without hypoglycemic effect. Sericin alleviated dysmorphic mitochondria in heart and liver but not in kidney and also decreased peculiar endoplasmic reticulum in the exocrine pancreas. In addition, sericin decreased hepatic steatosis and preserved zymogen granule referable to the decline of reactive oxygen species production in hepatic mitochondrial extraction and down-regulation of malondialdehyde expression in the liver and exocrine pancreas however irrelevant to lipase activity. This study suggests that sericin has antioxidative property to reduce blood cholesterol by means of diminishing fat deposit in hepatocyte and improves mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum integrities. Impact statement Impact statement The present work provides new insights regarding the antioxidative effect of sericin in (i) reducing blood cholesterol, (ii) improving liver and heart mitochondrial structures, (iii) maintaining endoplasmic reticulum integrity in exocrine pancreatic glands, and (iv) inhibiting fat deposition in the liver.

2-s2.0-85011880063,"Advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is typically aggressive and closely correlated with disease recurrence and poor survival. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the most critical problem leading to therapeutic failure. Investigation of novel anticancer candidates targeting multidrug- resistant OSCC cells may provide a basis for developing effective strategies for OSCC treatment. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of a carbazole alkaloid, namely isomahanine, in a multidrug-resistant OSCC cell line CLS-354/DX. We demonstrated that CLS-354/DX cells overexpressing multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) were resistant to anticancer drugs cisplatin and camptothecin. Isomahanine effectively induced cytotoxicity against CLS-354/DX cells regardless of resistance. Apoptosis as determined by FITC-Annexin V/PI staining and western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was significantly induced in a time-dependent manner upon isomahanine treatment. Isomahanine-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis was determined using z-VAD-fmk. The effects on autophagy in isomahanine-treated cells were investigated via conversion of LC3B and degradation of p62/SQSTM1 (p62). Isomahanine obviously induced autophagic flux as shown by an increase in punctate GFP-LC3B and the LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio with a concomitant decrease in p62 levels. Autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ) protected isomahanine-induced cell death, indicating the activation of autophagic cell death. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and MAPK activation were examined to elucidate the mechanism underlying cell death. The expression levels of PERK, CHOP and phosphorylated MAPK (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) were upregulated following isomahanine treatment. We found that p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) significantly attenuated isomahanine-induced apoptosis and autophagic flux and this prevented cell death. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that isomahanine was able to induce ER stress and trigger p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis and autophagic cell death in multidrug-resistant OSCC cells. The potential cytotoxic action of isomahanine may provide the development of anticancer candidates for treating multidrug-resistant cancer."
2-s2.0-85011382723,"Background: Several functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the FOXE1 locus on chromosome 9q22.33 have been associated with the risk for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This study set out to elucidate whether their effects are independent, using genotyping results in populations of Asian and European descent. Methods: SNPs rs965513 and rs1867277 and a polymorphic region determining the length of the FOXE1 polyalanine (poly-Ala) tract were genotyped in 501 patients with PTC and 748 healthy individuals from Japan, and in 660 patients and 820 population controls from Belarus. Functional analysis of transactivation activities of FOXE1 isoforms with varying number of alanine repeats was performed by a Dual-Luciferase® Assay. Results: All three polymorphisms were significantly associated with PTC in both populations on univariate analysis. However, conditional analysis revealed independent effects of rs965513 and rs1867277 SNPs but not of the FOXE1 poly-Ala polymorphism. The independent effect of the lead rs965513 SNP was observed in both populations, while that of rs1867277 was only identified in the Japanese population, in which linkage disequilibrium between the three polymorphisms is markedly weaker. Despite the strong decrease in transcriptional activity with increasing FOXE1 poly-Ala tract length, no difference in transactivation potential of the FOXE1 poly-Ala isoforms could be seen after adjustment for the minimal promoter activity in the reporter vectors. Plasmids encoding FOXE1 isoforms of increasing poly-Ala tract length were also found to produce less FOXE1 protein after cell transfection. Conclusions: The functional variants rs965513 and rs1867277 independently contribute to genetic predisposition to PTC, while a contributing role of the FOXE1 poly-Ala polymorphism could not be confirmed. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

2-s2.0-85010366371,"Introduction The purposes of this retrospective study were to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of mineral trioxide aggregate apexification and revascularization in nonvital immature permanent teeth and to analyze factors influencing treatment outcome. Methods Forty-six cases (29 cases of apexification and 17 cases of revascularization) were recruited into this study. Patients’ preoperative and postoperative information was analyzed. Treatment outcomes were categorized as a success or failure and functional retention. Further root development was assessed in terms of the percentage changes in root length and root width. Results The success rates of mineral trioxide aggregate apexification and revascularization were 80.77% and 76.47% and functional retention was 82.76% and 88.24%, respectively. Revascularization provided significantly greater percentage changes in root width (13.75%) in comparison with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) apexification (−3.30%). The mean percentage change of increased root length was 9.51% in the revascularization group and 8.55% in the MTA apexification group. Interestingly, revascularization showed various degrees of increased root length ranging from −4% to 58%. Fracture was the main cause of failure in MTA apexified teeth. All failed revascularized teeth presented with signs and symptoms of apical periodontitis caused by persistent infection. Conclusions MTA apexification and revascularization provide a reliable outcome in the aspects of resolution of the disease and tooth functional retention. None of these treatments provides satisfactory predictable further root development. © 2016 American Association of Endodontists"
2-s2.0-85009415878,"Introduction This study aimed to illustrate the treatment outcomes of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) pulpotomy in vital permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure. Methods MTA pulpotomy was performed in 66 vital permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure including teeth with signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and the presence of periapical radiolucency. Patients were assessed for clinical and radiographic outcomes by 2 examiners. The relationship between treatment outcomes and factors was analyzed by means of univariate analysis and binary logistic regression. Results Fifty patients (a total of 55 teeth) attended the follow-up examination. The age of the patients ranged from 7–68 years old (mean = 29 years old). For the follow-up period as far as 62 months, 48 teeth showed successful outcomes (success rate = 87.3%). Teeth with clinical signs of irreversible pulpitis and the presence of periapical radiolucency could be treated successfully by MTA pulpotomy with success rates of 84% and 76%, respectively.Three of 7 failed cases required pulpectomy after MTA pulpotomy to relieve painful pulpitis. Four other failed cases were asymptomatic, and failure was detected from radiographic examination. The relationship between treatment outcomes and treatment factors could not be detected statistically. Conclusions Teeth with carious pulp exposure can be treated successfully by MTA pulpotomy. Clinical signs of irreversible pulpitis and the presence of periapical radiolucency should not be considered as a contraindication for pulpotomy. © 2016 American Association of Endodontists"
2-s2.0-85011673013,"3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DHPA) dioxygenase (DHPAO) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaDHPAO) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. As the enzyme lost activity over time, a protocol to reactivate and conserve PaDHPAO activity has been developed. Addition of Fe(II), DTT and ascorbic acid or ROS scavenging enzymes (catalase or superoxide dismutase) was required to preserve enzyme stability. Metal content and activity analyses indicated that PaDHPAO uses Fe(II) as a metal cofactor. NMR analysis of the reaction product indicated that PaDHPAO catalyzes the 2,3-extradiol ringcleavage of DHPA to form 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde (CHMS) which has a molar absorptivity of 32.23 mM-1cm-1 at 380 nm and pH 7.5. Steady-state kinetics under air-saturated conditions at 25°C and pH 7.5 showed a Km for DHPA of 58 ± 8 μM and a kcat of 64 s-1, indicating that the turnover of PaDHPAO is relatively fast compared to other DHPAOs. The pH-rate profile of the PaDHPAO reaction shows a bell-shaped plot that exhibits a maximum activity at pH 7.5 with two pKa values of 6.5 ± 0.1 and 8.9 ± 0.1. Study of the effect of temperature on PaDHPAO activity indicated that the enzyme activity increases as temperature increases up to 55°C. The Arrhenius plot of ln(k'cat) versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature shows two correlations with a transition temperature at 35°C. Two activation energy values (Ea) above and below the transition temperature were calculated as 42 and 14 kJ/mol, respectively. The data imply that the rate determining steps of the PaDHPAO reaction at temperatures above and below 35°C may be different. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that PaDHPAO belongs to the enzyme clusters that are largely unexplored. As PaDHPAO has a high turnover number compared to most of the enzymes previously reported, understanding its biochemical and biophysical properties should be useful for future applications in biotechnology. © 2017 Pornsuwan et al.

2-s2.0-85011623222,"This experiment examined the efficacy of Clitoria ternatea extract (CTE) in curtailing lipid and protein oxidation taking place in cooked pork patties during refrigerator storage. The pork meats mixed with CTE (0.02–0.16% w/w) were cooked and stored in a refrigerator (4C) for 12 days. The results showed that the cooked pork patties with added CTE showed high radical scavenging activity. Addition of CTE (0.02–0.16% w/w) significantly reduced the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Protein oxidation was seen to involve a decrease in carbonyl content and a concomitant increase in protein thiol levels in cooked pork patties containing CTE during storage. In addition, the pork patties together with CTE had a lower Hunter color L*- and higher a*-value than control. CTE (0.08–0.16%) had the potential to inhibit oxidative rancidity as well as synthetic antioxidant (0.02% BHT). The findings indicate that CTE has great potential as a natural antioxidant for producing functionally improved meat products. Practical Applications: Ready-to-eat products are highly prone to oxidative deterioration. Synthetic antioxidants have been used to control oxidative damage. In recent years, natural antioxidants have increasingly replaced artificial preservatives in food products. This work has proven the practical value of blue pea extract in ready-to-eat food flavoring as it is proved to have good antioxidant properties. These results demonstrate the potential combined use of blue pea extract to the meat industry in the development of novel healthy meat products with improved shelf life of stored products without affecting other qualities and hence making the consumer healthier. This research explores the effects of natural antioxidants on quality changes of cooked pork patties during refrigerated storage. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-85009783261,"Epstein-Barr virus-associated undifferentiated (lymphoepithelial) carcinoma is a malignancy that most commonly arises in the nasopharynx but can also occur in other locations including the lacrimal sac. Generally, this tumor strongly expresses cytokeratin, making the diagnosis straightforward. In the absence of confirmatory immunohistochemistry, the diagnosis can be problematic, particularly for tumors arising in unusual locations. Only 3 cases arising in the lacrimal sac in association with Epstein-Barr virus have been reported in the English literature, and all showed typical pathologic findings. The authors report a fourth case, unique in that it showed negative immunostaining for all cytokeratins tested. The clue to the nature of the tumor came from identification of Epstein-Barr virus by in-situ hybridization and demonstration of tonofilaments by electron microscopy. This case demonstrates that a multimodal approach may be needed in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated carcinoma, especially when occurring in uncommon locations. © 2015 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc."
2-s2.0-85008415010,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of single or/and double strains of probiotic supplement on feed efficiency, growth performance, and microbial population in distal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of weaning rabbits. Methods: Sixty-four weaning (28 days old) New Zealand White rabbits were randomly distributed into four groups with treatments including: basal diet without probiotic supplement (control) or supplemented as follows: 1×106 cfu/g B. subtilis (BS group), 1×107 cfu/g L. acidophilus (LA group), or 0.5×106 cfu/g B. subtilis plus 0.5×107 cfu/g L. acidophilus (BL group). During the research, the male and female rabbits were fed separately. Body weight of the rabbits was recorded at 28, 42, and 70 d of age. Results: There was an increase (p<0.05) in body weight gain for the LA group at 42 d. Rabbits fed BL responsed with a greater growth (p<0.05) and better feed conversion ratio (p<0.05) than those fed with no probiotic. Digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and gross energy were higher (p<0.05) in LA and BL groups than those in the control group. Male rabbits had higher (p<0.05) Bacilli spp. and Coliformis spp. in the ileum than female rabbits. Rabbits supplemented with BS had greater (p<0.05) numbers of bacilli in all intestinal segments than those receiving no probiotic, whereas intestinal Lactobacilli populations were greater (p<0.001) in the LA and BL diets compared to control. Average intestinal coliform populations were lowest (p<0.05) in the rabbits supplemented with LA as compared to those fed the control and BS. Conclusion: Supplementation of L. acidophilus alone or in combination with B. subtilis at a half of dose could enhance number of gut beneficial bacteria populations, nutrient digestibility, cecal fermentation, feed efficiency, and growth performance, but rabbits receiving only B. subtilis alone were not different from the controls without probiotic.

In this study, we evaluated the replication ability of the three novel H3N1 reassortant viruses recovered from pandemic H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) and duck H3N2 (dkH3N2) co-infected quail generated from our previous study in embryonated chicken eggs, mammalian (MDCK) and human lung derived (A549) cells. Our study demonstrated that all of the reassortant viruses replicated efficiently in avian and mammalian cells, albeit with slightly lower titers than the parental viruses. Of note, all of the reassortant viruses showed enhanced replication in human lung derived A549 cells compared to their parental viruses. Interestingly, among the reassortant viruses tested, a reassortant virus (P(NA,NS)-DK) containing NA and NS genes derived from pH1N1 and the other genes from dkH3N2 exhibited the highest replication ability in all in vitro models, indicating a high level of gene compatibility of this reassortant virus. Our results highlight the potential role of quail as intermediate hosts for the generation of the viable reassortant viruses with ability to replicate efficiently in avian, mammalian, and particularly human lung derived cells. These findings emphasize the need for the continuous IAV surveillance in quail to prevent the risk of the emergence of the novel viable reassortant viruses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85007610435,"A variety of terms are used interchangeably to define managerial competence of first-line nurse managers. This has resulted in a degree of ambiguity in the way managerial competence is described. The aim of this concept analysis is to clarify what is meant by managerial competence of first-line nurse managers internationally, what attributes signify it, and what its antecedents and consequences are. The Walker and Avant concept analysis approach was applied. The attributes of managerial competence include developing self, planning, organizing, leading, managing legal and ethical issues, and delivering health care. Antecedents to managerial competence include internal and external factors. Consequences include nurse performances, nurse and patient outcomes, intention to stay of nurses, and nurse and patient satisfaction. This analysis helps first-line nurse managers to understand the concept and determine where the responsibility lies in establishing a definition of managerial competence. It is recommended that middle and top managers should be aware of the internal and external factors as antecedents of the concept. Further research is needed to illuminate the attributes of managerial competence in relation to antecedents and the potential effect upon the consequences, and the need to establish managerial competence evaluation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"
2-s2.0-85007495617,"Self-discharge caused by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coinciding with corrosion of the zinc anode is a major drawback of printed zinc-air batteries. Thus, this work aims at suppressing self-discharge of flexible printed zinc-air batteries by coating thin layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) onto the surface of zinc particles. The (Al2O3) coating layer was directly synthesized onto the zinc particles by a low-cost and facile sol–gel method. The (Al2O3) coating effectively mitigated HER of the zinc particles, and delayed the corrosion of the zinc anode. Further, the effects of the thickness of (Al2O3) layer on corrosion behavior of the zinc anode in 9 M potassium hydroxide as well as performance of the batteries were investigated. With a proper thickness of (Al2O3) coating, corrosion of the battery was considerably suppressed without sacrificing the battery performance.

2-s2.0-85008343598,"The protection of water, land, and air resources has profound implications for the sustainability of ecosystem services provided to societies that are embedded within economies, global systems, and socio-cultural and political contexts. This study assessed preferences for provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, specifically, climate regulation (carbon sequestration), nutrient control (water quality), and agricultural and forest productivity, and the willingness to pay for protection of these ecosystem services by residents in the Suwannee River Basin of Florida, as assessed through a household mail survey and choice experiment. A conditional logit model was used to evaluate preferences and marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) under different scenarios. Survey respondents identified nutrient control (water quality) as the most important service, while agricultural and forestry production was somewhat important, and climate regulation/carbon sequestration was the least important. Respondents expressed the highest level of trust in local government agencies to implement ecosystem service protection programs, and welcomed the implementation of such programs anywhere in the basin, but not close to their home. The average MWTP was extremely low (<$2/household/year) when compared to other studies, and suggests that respondents have many competing interests for their discretionary spending in relation to environmental amenities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85007473614,"Background: The nose is a dangerous site for filler injection. This study investigated the anatomy of the dorsal nasal artery at the upper part of the nose to clarify how ocular complications occur. Methods: Dissections were performed in 50 noses of the embalmed cadavers. Either the soft embalming or formaldehyde embalming processes were used. Results: The dorsal nasal artery is not a constant artery. The artery traveled in the subcutaneous tissue layer of the nasal dorsum on the transverse nasalis muscle and its midline nasal aponeurosis which connected the muscles on both sides. Bilateral dorsal nasal arteries existed only in 34%. In 28% of the specimens, a single and large dorsal nasal artery was presented. The diameter was 0.4 ± 0.2 mm when bilateral dorsal nasal arteries were present and 0.7 ± 0.3 mm in a single artery. The largest artery was 1.2 mm. The artery usually crossed the midline at the middle third part of the nose over the upper lateral cartilages to form an anastomosis with the contralateral lateral nasal artery as the oblique nasal artery in 14%. The artery might descend and communicate with the ipsilateral lateral nasal artery in 6% or descended as a midline artery and form the nasal tip plexus in 8%. In 38% of the specimens, the arteries became small, formed a subcutaneous plexus and randomly distributed on the superficial layer of the subcutaneous tissue in the upper two-thirds of the nose. Conclusion: During the injections at the upper (bony) and middle (cartilaginous) part of the nose for nasal dorsal augmentation, the injector has to make sure the cannula tip is in the preperiosteal plane by reinsertion of the cannula if needed, due to the chance of encountering the large single dorsal nasal artery at the midline.

2-s2.0-85007159367,"Introduction: Heinz bodies are important to diagnosing and managing patients. However, microscopic examination of Heinz bodies has several disadvantages, demonstrating the need for a better method. We explored the potential use of flow cytometry to examine Heinz bodies. Methods: Whole-blood samples were collected from patients deficient in G6PD and healthy volunteers. Acetylphenylhydrazine was used to induce formation of Heinz bodies in red blood cells (RBCs). Then, RBCs positive for Heinz bodies were examined using a FACSCanto II cytometer. Results: RBCs treated with acetylphenylhydrazine formed Heinz bodies and emitted a broad spectrum of fluorescence that could be detected by flow cytometry. The maximum emission of fluorescence was observed at 45 min after the incubation with acetylphenylhydrazine. In addition, the fluorescence emitted was stable for at least 72 h. The flow cytometer could detect the RBCs positive for Heinz bodies even if they made up as little as 0.1% of the total RBC population. Furthermore, the percentage and number, respectively, of RBCs positive for Heinz bodies in G6PD-deficient patients and normal donors exhibited a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 68.9 ± 27.5 vs. 50.9 ± 28.6 and 96 014 ±35 732 cells/μL vs. 74 688 ± 36 514 cells/μL. Conclusion: Heinz bodies induced by acetylphenylhydrazine emit fluorescence, and this fluorescence could be examined using flow cytometry.

2-s2.0-85006918777,"Background: Though most injectors prefer to use a cannula rather than a needle, there have been reported cases of blindness following cannula injections. This study investigated possible situations in which a cannula can injure an artery to gain more insight about the vascular complication and its prevention. Methods: To understand how an arterial injury occurs, five situations favoring vascular injury were simulated and tested. Experiments were performed in 100 arterial segments of 10 soft embalmed cadavers with red latex injections to the arteries. The frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery with a diameter between 1.2 and 1.5 mm was chosen for the experiment with a 25G cannula. Five situations were created to simulate any possibility that the cannula can penetrate through the arterial wall. Two factors were varied for simulation of specific danger situations. Factors that vary were as follows: (1) the angles between the cannula and the artery when the cannula touched the artery, and (2) the segments of the artery with different features. Results: The cannula could penetrate the arterial wall in some specific situations with a different chance in each situation. The perpendicular angle between the artery and the cannula was one of the essential situations for vascular injury. Situations that had a similar effect of the perpendicular arterial surface related to the cannula axis also favored vascular injuries. Conclusion: During a blinded insertion of cannula injections to reach the target area, the injector cannot discriminate the sensation at the cannula tip between the resistance of a fibrous septum in the way of the insertion and the resistance of encountering an artery. To prevent arterial emboli, the cannula trajectory should not be close to the main artery in the region. This allows a physician to safely perform an intermittent forceful insertion without an arterial injury during an attempt to perform a gentle cannula insertion.

2-s2.0-85006381853,"A novel paper-based electrochemical biosensor was developed using an anthraquinone-labeled pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) probe (AQ-PNA) and graphene-polyaniline (G-PANI) modified electrode to detect human papillomavirus (HPV). An inkjet printing technique was employed to prepare the paper-based G-PANI-modified working electrode. The AQ-PNA probe baring a negatively charged amino acid at the N-terminus was immobilized onto the electrode surface through electrostatic attraction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to verify the AQ-PNA immobilization. The paper-based electrochemical DNA biosensor was used to detect a synthetic 14-base oligonucleotide target with a sequence corresponding to human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA by measuring the electrochemical signal response of the AQ label using square-wave voltammetry before and after hybridization. It was determined that the current signal significantly decreased after the addition of target DNA. This phenomenon is explained by the rigidity of PNA-DNA duplexes, which obstructs the accessibility of electron transfer from the AQ label to the electrode surface. Under optimal conditions, the detection limit of HPV type 16 DNA was found to be 2.3 nM with a linear range of 10–200 nM. The performance of this biosensor on real DNA samples was tested with the detection of PCR-amplified DNA samples from the SiHa cell line. The new method employs an inexpensive and disposable device, which easily incinerated after use and is promising for the screening and monitoring of the amount of HPV-DNA type 16 to identify the primary stages of cervical cancer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85006324295,"Background: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification and needs vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. High levels of desphosphorylated uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) were significantly associated with vitamin K deficiency and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to explore the correlations of plasma dp-ucMGP with vascular calcification and vascular stiffness in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 83 CKD stages 3-5 patients. Vascular calcification score was determined by calcific lesions in the abdominal aorta (AAC) shown by lateral lumbar film; vascular stiffness was assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and pulse wave velocity, while plasma dp-ucMGP levels were measured using ELISA method. Multivariate regression analyses were used to select factors that were independently associated with vascular calcification and vascular stiffness. Results: The mean age was 62.9 ± 13.9 years. CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 constituted 51.8, 13.3, and 34.9%, respectively. The median of plasma dp-ucMGP levels in CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 were 586 (452-888), 870 (594-1,591), and 1,050 (518-1,298) pmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of vascular calcification (AAC score ≥1) was 63.4% and that of vascular stiffness (CAVI ≥9) was 46.3%. Vascular calcification was correlated with vascular stiffness (r2 = 0.50, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis models to predict vascular calcification showed that age and plasma dp-ucMGP levels were significantly correlated with vascular calcification (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.33; p < 0.001 and OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.001-1.004; p = 0.004, respectively). In contrast, there was no association between plasma dp-ucMGP levels and vascular stiffness. Conclusions: Plasma dp-ucMGP levels increase according to the severity of CKD. Plasma dp-ucMGP was positively associated with vascular calcification and might be utilized as an early marker for vascular calcification in CKD patients. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel."

2-s2.0-85006293761,"We report a combined paleomagnetic and U–Pb geochronologic study of sedimentary rocks from the Huai Hin Lat and Nam Phong formations of Mesozoic age in NE Thailand in order to provide independent constraints on the tectonic movement of the Indochina Block during convergence of the major blocks now comprising East Asia. The maximum allowable depositional age of the two formations is estimated to be 227 Ma and 215 Ma, respectively, from detrital zircon U–Pb geochronologic analysis which also indicates a sediment source transition in the Khorat Plateau Basin during the Middle–Late Jurassic. A formation mean paleomagnetic direction of Dg/Ig=21.4°/38.1° (kg=19.5, α95=9.6°) before and Ds/Is=43.0°/48.0° (ks=47.4, α95=6.1°, N=13) after tilt correction is derived from samples with different lithologies, bedding attitudes, magnetic carriers and polarities and yields a positive fold test. Hence, the magnetization is likely primary. The revised Mesozoic APWP of the Indochina Block yields paleolatitudes (for a reference site of 22°N, 102°E) of 33.4 ± 7.2°N during the Norian Late Triassic, 25.9 ± 5.9°N during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, 23.9 ± 8°N during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, 27.5 ± 3.2°N during the Early Cretaceous and 24.5 ± 4.9°N by the Late Cretaceous; corresponding declinations are 45.2 ± 8.6°, 38.0 ± 6.6°, 36.3 ± 8.8°, 29.6 ± 3.6° and 24.9 ± 5.4° respectively. These data indicate a significantly southward displacement accompanied by clockwise rotation during the Mesozoic. A reconstruction of the Indochina Block within the now well-studied merging process of South China and North China indicates that the Indochina Block was located at a higher latitude than the South China Block during the Norian stage of Late Triassic times whilst no significant relative poleward displacement apparently occurred during the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous interval.

2-s2.0-85003967137,"This study assessed the biodegradation of mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by indigenous bacteria in river sediment. Microcosms were constructed from sediment from the Chao Phraya River (the main river in Thailand) by supplementation with high concentrations of fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene (300 mg kg−1 of each PAH), and acenaphthene (600 mg kg−1). Fluorene and phenanthrene were completely degraded, whereas 50% of the pyrene and acenaphthene were removed at the end of the incubation period (70 days). Community analyses revealed the dynamics of the bacterial profiles in the PAH-degrading microcosms after PAH exposure. Actinobacteria predominated and became significantly more abundant in the microcosms after 14 days of incubation at room temperature under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, the remaining PAHs and alpha diversity were positively correlated. The sequencing of clone libraries of the PAH-RHDα genes also revealed that the dioxygenase genes of Mycobacterium sp. comprised 100% of the PAH-RHDα library at the end of the microcosm setup. Moreover, two PAH-degrading Actinobacteria (Arthrobacter sp. and Rhodococcus ruber) were isolated from the original sediment sample and showed high activity in the degradation of phenanthrene and fluorene in liquid cultivation. This study reveals that indigenous bacteria had the ability to degrade high concentrations of mixed PAHs and provide clear evidence that Actinobacteria may be potential candidates to play a major role in PAH degradation in the river sediment. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Ni(OH)2 was subject to 300 °C calcination temperature and mixed with TiO2 sol before incorporation with TiO2. Acid orange 7 (AO7) in KPH/HCl buffer (pH = 3) was used for both electrochemical process and photocatalytic activity testing of the film. The TiO2[sbnd]NiO/TiO2 film showed catalytic activity even without illumination implying that the energy stored during the illumination drove the reaction when there was no illumination. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84995938576,"Objective Cancer stem cells contribute to tumor recurrence, and a hypoxic environment is critical for maintaining cancer stem cells. Apigenin is a natural product with anticancer activity. However, the effect of apigenin on cancer stem cells remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the effect of apigenin on cancer stem cell marker expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells under hypoxia. Design We used three head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines; HN-8, HN-30, and HSC-3. The mRNA expression of cancer stem cell markers was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Real-time PCR. The cytotoxic effect of apigenin was determined by MTT colorimetric assay. Flow cytometry was used to reveal the number of cells expressing cancer stem cell surface markers. Results HN-30 cells, a cancer cell line from the pharynx, showed the greatest response to hypoxia by increasing their expression of CD44, CD105, NANOG, OCT-4, REX-1, and VEGF. Apigenin significantly decreased HN-30 cell viability in dose- and time-dependent manners. In addition, 40 μM apigenin significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of CD44, NANOG, and CD105. Consistent with these results, the hypoxia-induced increase in CD44+ cells, CD105+ cells, and STRO-1+ cells was significantly abolished by apigenin. Conclusion Apigenin suppresses cancer stem cell marker expression and the number of cells expressing cell surface markers under hypoxia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85002486051,"Recently, mental health problems (MHP) in school-aged children have become a global phenomenon. Yet, the number of children affected remains unclear in Indonesia, and the effects of mental health problems are of concern. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of MHP in school-aged children and its relationship to personal, maternal, and familial factors in Aceh province, Indonesia. Participants were 143 school-aged children with MHP and their mothers. They completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Social Competence Questionnaire, Brief Family Relationship Scale, Parental Stress Scale, Parent's Report Questionnaire, and Indonesian Version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Mainly, children were rated to have emotional symptoms by their mothers (37.8%). Factors such as academic competence, family relationships, and maternal parenting stress are related to MHP. Given the high prevalence of school-aged children that have emotional symptoms, child psychiatric mental health nurses should give special attention to assist them during their school years. Moreover, nurses should aim to improve family relationships and reduce maternal parenting stress. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84997416778,"Periodontal ligament cells have the potential to differentiate into bone forming osteoblasts and thus represent a good cellular candidate for bone regeneration. This study aimed to investigate the effect of inhibition of histone deacetylases, using the inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), on bone regeneration by human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) in a mouse calvaria bone defect. Methods RUNX2 protein and its acetylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The effect of TSA on osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs was investigated using in vitro 3D cultures. hPDLCs were pre-incubated with and without TSA and implanted in mouse calvaria defects with polycaprolactone/polyethylene glycol (PCL/PEG) co-polymer scaffold. Micro-CT scanning and bone histomorphometric analysis were used to quantify the amount of bone. Survival of hPDLCs as xenogenic grafts was verified by immunohistochemistry with anti-human β1-integrin. The immunological response of mice against hPDLCs xenografts was evaluated by measuring total IgG and hPDLCs-specific IgG. Results: Beside affecting histone protein, TSA also induced hyper-acetylation of RUNX2 which might be a crucial mechanism for enhancing osteogenesis by hPDLCs. TSA enhanced mineral deposition by hPDLCs in in vitro 3D cultures and had no effect on cell viability. In vivo bone regeneration of mouse calvaria defects was significantly enhanced by TSA pre-treated hPDLCs. By using anti-human ß1 integrin hPDLCs were shown to differentiate into osteocyte-like cells that were present in newly formed bone. hPDLCs, as a xenograft, slightly but not significantly induced an immunological response in recipient mice as demonstrated by the level of total IgG and hPDLCs-specific IgG. Conclusion Inhibition of histone deacetylases by TSA enhanced in vivo bone regeneration by hPDLCs. The data strongly suggest a novel approach to regenerate bone tissue. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-84995598599,"Canine pyometra is considered a serious and life-threatening condition. Due to the relationship among sex steroid hormones, oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression, and canine pyometra pathogenesis, this study aimed to investigate the expression of oxytocin, progesterone, and estrogen receptors in the reproductive tissues of canines with pyometra by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. A total of 27 pyometra bitches were classified into open- and closed-cervix pyometra groups based on the presence of vaginal discharge. Moreover, 15 normal bitches in the luteal phase served as a control group. The results showed that OTR gene expression in the ovary of pyometra bitches was higher than that of normal bitches, whereas the level of OTR gene expression in the cervix of pyometra bitches was less than that of normal bitches (P < 0.05). Conversely, a lower OTR H-score in ovarian follicles was observed in pyometra bitches compared with normal bitches, whereas a higher percentage of OTR-positive immunostaining in uteri and cervices were found in pyometra bitches compared with normal bitches (P < 0.05). Moreover, the H-scores of estrogen receptor alpha in uteri and cervices of pyometra bitches were less than that of normal bitches (P < 0.05). However, the localization of the OTR and sex steroid receptors between groups of pyometra bitches was not different. Our findings suggest that pyometra pathogenesis is associated with a change in expression of OTR and sex steroid receptors in the canine reproductive tract. However, cervical dilation in bitches with pyometra was not influenced by the expression of OTR and sex steroid receptors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-84994476843,"Methylglyoxal (MG) can react with amino acids of proteins to induce protein glycation and consequently the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Previous studies reported that ferulic acid (FA) prevented glucose-, fructose-, and ribose-induced protein glycation. In this study, FA (0.1–1 mM) inhibited MG-induced protein glycation and oxidative protein damage in bovine serum albumin (BSA). Furthermore, FA (0.0125–0.2 mM) protected against lysine/MG-mediated oxidative DNA damage, thereby inhibiting superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical generation during lysine and MG reaction. In addition, FA did not have the ability to trap MG. Finally, FA (0.1 mM) pretreatment attenuated MG-induced decrease in cell viability and prevented MG-induced cell apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. The results suggest that FA is capable of protecting β-cells from MG-induced cell damage during diabetes. © 2016, University of Navarra."
2-s2.0-85006054784,"Objective To identify factors associated with successful ultrasound guidance for each surgical step of ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and Methods Consecutive patients undergoing PCNL between March 2015 and June 2016 were prospectively enrolled. An attempt was made to use ultrasound guidance in renal access, tract dilation, and nephrostomy tube placement for each patient. For steps during which ultrasound guidance was unsuccessful, fluoroscopic screening was applied. Regression analysis identified patient characteristics associated with successful use of ultrasound guidance. Results A total of 96 patients composed this cohort, with a mean body mass index of 28.7 kg/m2. Mean stone size was 33.1 ± 18.9 mm, and no hydronephrosis was found in 63.5% of cases. Fluoroscopic screening was required for renal access in 27 cases (28.1%), tract dilation in 38 (39.6%), and nephrostomy tube placement in 80 (83.3%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that successful ultrasound guidance was significantly associated with the presence of hydronephrosis for renal access and the absence of staghorn calculi for tract dilation. Ultrasound-guided nephrostomy tube placement appeared linked to surgeon experience. Conclusion To achieve completely x-ray–free ultrasound-guided PCNL, the ideal patient should have a hydronephrotic collecting system with no staghorn stone present. For practitioners looking to adopt ultrasound guidance into their PCNL practice, these represent the most appropriate patients to safely initiate a surgical experience. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-84994442827,"Clip domain serine proteinases (ClipSPs) play critical roles in the activation of proteolytic cascade in invertebrate immune systems including the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system. In this study, we characterized a snake-like serine protease, namely PmSnake, from the shrimp Penaeus monodon which has previously been identified based on the subtractive cDNA library of proPO double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-treated hemocytes. An open reading frame of PmSnake contains 1068 bp encoding a predicted protein of 355 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids and two conserved domains (N-terminal clip domain and C-terminal trypsin-like serine proteinase domain). Sequence analysis revealed that PmSnake was closest to the AeSnake from ant Acromyrmex echinatior (53% similarity), but was quite relatively distant from other shrimp PmclipSPs. PmSnake transcript was mainly expressed in shrimp hemocytes and up-regulated after systemic Vibrio harveyi infection indicating that it is an immune-responsive gene. Suppression of PmSnake expression by dsRNA interference reduced both transcript and protein levels leading to a reduction of the hemolymph phenoloxidase (PO) activity (36%), compared to the control, suggesting that the PmSnake functions as a clip-SP in shrimp proPO system. Western blot analysis using anti-PmSnake showed that the PmSnake was detected in hemocytes but not in cell-free plasma. In vitro PO activity and serine proteinase activity assays showed that adding rPmSnake into the shrimp hemolymph could increase PO activity as well as serine proteinase activity suggesting that the rPmSnake activates the proPO system via serine proteinase cascade. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-84995792946,"Background: The Chinese Medicine NeuroAiD Efficacy on Stroke recovery - Extension (CHIMES-E) study is among the few acute stroke trials with long-term outcome data. We aimed to evaluate the recovery pattern and the influence of prognostic factors on treatment effect of MLC601 over 2 years. Methods: The CHIMES-E study evaluated the 2 years outcome of subjects aged ≥18 years with acute ischemic stroke, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 6-14, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤1 included in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MLC601 for 3 months. Standard stroke care and rehabilitation were allowed during follow-up with mRS score being assessed in-person at month (M) 3 and by telephone at M1, M6, M12, M18 and M24. Results: Data from 880 subjects were analyzed. There was no difference in baseline characteristics between treatment groups. The proportion of subjects with mRS score 0-1 increased over time in favor of MLC601 most notably from M3 to M6, thereafter remaining stable up to M24, while the proportion deteriorating to mRS score ≥2 remained low at all time points. Older age (p < 0.01), female sex (p = 0.06), higher baseline NIHSS score (p < 0.01) and longer onset to treatment time (OTT; p < 0.01) were found to be predictors of poorer outcome at M3. Greater treatment effect, with more subjects improving on MLC601 than placebo, was seen among subjects with 2 or more prognostic factors (OR 1.65 at M3, 1.78 at M6, 1.90 at M12, 1.65 at M18, 1.39 at M24), especially in subjects with more severe stroke or longer OTT. Conclusions: The sustained benefits of MLC601 over 2 years were due to more subjects improving to functional independence at M6 and beyond compared to placebo. Selection of subjects with poorer prognosis, particularly those with more severe NIHSS score and longer OTT delay, as well as a long follow-up period, may improve the power of future trials investigating the treatment effect of neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapies. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

2-s2.0-84994226123,"CrustinPm1 and crustinPm7 are the two most abundant isoforms of crustins identified from the hemocytes of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. CrustinPm1 inhibits only Gram-positive bacteria, while crustinPm7 acts against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work aims to characterize the molecular properties of recombinant crustinPm1 and crustinPm7, and the regulatory pathways of these two crustins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that crustinPm1 contained 40.81% alpha-helix and 22.34% beta-sheet, whereas crustinPm7 is made up of 32.86% alpha-helix and 27.53% beta-sheet. CrustinPm1 and crustinPm7 bound to phosphatidic acid (PA) with positive cooperativity of Hill slope (H) > 2, indicating that at least two molecules of crustins bind with one PA molecule. It is worth noting that both crustins bound to PA with significantly higher affinity than to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We speculate that crustin might also achieve antimicrobial activity by targeting PA, a signaling lipid. Regulatory pathways of crustinPm1 and crustinPm7 were investigated by knockdown of PmRelish and PmMyD88. This study demonstrated that crustinPm1 is mediated through the Toll signaling pathway, while crustinPm7 is regulated via both Toll and Imd pathways. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Different amounts of ZSM-5 seeds were added into the Ia-3d mesopore silica gel to yield ZM-x composites (where x is the wt.% loading level of ZSM-5). The structure characterization, morphology and acidity of the synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 13C-NMR techniques. The composite materials were found to have properties of both mesoporous (MCA) and ZSM-5, with the ZSM-5 loading level having a major effect on the structure of the Ia-3d mesoporous composite. The MCA-Pr-SO3H catalytic activity in the anisole alkylation reaction with tert-butanol was compared to that of Amberlyst-15, ZSM-5 and ZM-30 materials. The highest yield of total tert-butylated anisole (TBA) products was obtained with MCA-Pr-SO3H, with the major products being 4-tert-butyl anisole (4-TBA), 2-tert-butyl anisole and 2, 4-di-tert-butyl anisole.

In the current study, the α-enolase-based DNA vaccine was constructed and examined for its effectiveness against SI infection in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The juvenile tilapia were immunized intramuscularly with DNA vaccine, pEno, and kept for 30 days prior to the intraperitoneal challenge with 2.7 × 107 CFU of pathogenic SI. At two weeks post challenge, the pEno group yielded the highest survival rate at 72.5%, whereas mock vaccination and negative control groups gained only 40 and 25%, respectively. The protection of vaccine tended to be related to the expression of immune-relevant genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, COX-2, IL-12β and IL-13Rα1) at 7 day post-vaccination (dpv) and the anti-SI serum antibody level at 30 dpv (before in vivo challenge).

2-s2.0-84991071437,"A fundamental feature of insect colonies is the presence of a sterile worker caste. In the presence of a queen, worker reproduction is suppressed, leading to degradation of the ovaries. However in the absence of the queen, some young workers activate their ovaries and lay eggs that can result in viable male offspring. The genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of worker sterility are only partially understood, but are of great interest since they are fundamental to the evolution of eusociality. Here, we determine whether DNA methylation of the transcription factor, Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), is associated with ovary activation in workers of honeybee. Workers were reared under queenless conditions and separated into control and CO2-treated cages (CO2 narcosis is known to suppress ovary activation in queenless workers). Patterns of DNA methylation of Kr-h1 in the ovaries of 7-day-old adult workers showed that non-active ovaries had significantly higher levels of methylation at 4 CpG sites compared to workers with active ovaries. CO2 narcosis inhibited ovary activation, but did not alter methylation levels in non-active ovaries. These findings suggest that methylation of Kr-h1 contributes to the regulation of worker sterility in the honeybee. In addition to the overall finding of differential methylation between ovary-activated and non-activated workers, we found evidence of allele-specific methylation at one site. © 2016, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI)."

2-s2.0-84994129911,"Epigenetic modifications, mediated by DNA methylation, are involved in caste differentiation between queen and worker honey bees, Apis mellifera. This study uses methylation sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) to investigate whether genome-wide DNA methylation is implicated in the regulation of honey bee worker sterility and whether CO2 narcosis, which suppresses ovary activation in queenless workers, influences DNA methylation. Queenless workers were divided into control and experimental (CO2 narcosis) cages. We compared MS-AFLP patterns in CO2-treated and non-treated workers with and without activated ovaries at 4 h, 2 and 7 days after treatment. While there was evidence of DNA methylation in all samples, there was no detectable difference in genome-wide methylation patterns between any treatment comparisons. This suggests that mechanisms that regulate worker sterility in the adult honey bee worker are not related to genome-wide methylation, and that CO2 narcosis does not significantly affect DNA methylation patterns in the worker ovary. However, because DNA methylation is sparse in the honey bee, and because MS-AFLP detects only a proportion of methylated sites, it remains possible that a subset of genes that are responsible for the regulation of worker sterility are differentially methylated, but that we failed to pick these up in our genome-wide scan. © 2016 Australian Entomological Society"
2-s2.0-84988557100,"Macaca fascicularis fascicularis is distributed over a wide area of Southeast Asia. Thailand is located at the center of their distribution range and is the bridge connecting the two biogeographic regions of Indochina and Sunda. However, only a few genetic studies have explored the macaques in this region. To shed some light on the evolutionary history of M. f. fascicularis, including hybridization with M. mulatta, M. f. fascicularis and M. mulatta samples of known origins throughout Thailand and the vicinity were analyzed by molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including the hypervariable region 1, and Y-chromosomal DNA, including SRY and TSPY genes. The mtDNA phylogenetic analysis divided M. f. fascicularis into five subclades (Insular Indonesia, Sundaic Thai Gulf, Vietnam, Sundaic Andaman sea coast, and Indochina) and revealed genetic differentiation between the two sides of the Thai peninsula, which had previously been reported as a single group of Malay peninsular macaques. From the estimated divergence time of the Sundaic Andaman sea coast subclade, it is proposed that after M. f. fascicularis dispersed throughout Southeast Asia, some populations on the south-easternmost Indochina (eastern Thailand, southern Cambodia and southern Vietnam at the present time) migrated south-westwards across the land bridge, which was exposed during the glacial period of the late Pleistocene epoch, to the southernmost Thailand/northern peninsular Malaysia. Then, some of them migrated north and south to colonize the Thai Andaman sea coast and northern Sumatra, respectively. The SRY-TSPY phylogenetic analysis suggested that male-mediated gene flow from M. mulatta southward to M. f. fascicularis was restricted south of, but close to, the Isthmus of Kra. There was a strong impact of the geographical factors in Thailand, such as the Isthmus of Kra, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Phuket ranges and Sundaland, on M. f. fascicularis biogeography and their hybridization with M. mulatta. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

A suitable process for modifying the rheological property of konjac glucomannan (KGM) solution by enzymatic treatment was developed. A plant bioactive compound, andrographolide, was selected to use as core material. Mannanase (1500 units of enzyme) was used in the treatment of KGM solution. The concentration of KGM solution was varied from 9 to 18% (w/w). It was found that 12% (w/w) was the optimum KGM concentration that could be hydrolyzed to a viscosity of <100 mPa·s. HPLC analysis of hydrolyzed solution found a fair amount of DP4–DP7 oligosaccharides (where DP is degree of polymerization) were obtained. The solution was then used as coating material in spray drying with inlet air temperature of 170°C and outlet air temperature of 85°C. It was found that 12% (w/w) konjac glucomannan hydrolysate (KGMH) was suitable for coating 2% (w/w) andrographolide.

2-s2.0-84973577783,"Background: Accurate skin colour measurements are important for numerous medical applications including the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous disorders and the provision of maxillofacial soft tissue prostheses. Methods: In this study, we obtained accurate skin colour measurements from four different ethnic groups (Caucasian, Chinese, Kurdish, Thai) and at four different body locations (Forehead, cheek, inner arm, back of hand) with a view of establishing a new skin colour database for medical and cosmetic applications. Skin colours are measured using a spectrophotometer and converted to a device-independent standard colour appearance space (CIELAB) where skin colour is expressed as values along the three dimensions: Lightness L*, Redness a* and Yellowness b*. Skin colour differences and variation are then evaluated as a function of ethnicity and body location. Results: We report three main results: (1) When plotted in a standard colour appearance space (CIELAB), skin colour distributions for the four ethnic groups overlap significantly, although there are systematic mean differences. Between ethnicities, the most significant skin colour differences occur along the yellowness dimension, with Thai skin exhibiting the highest yellowness (b*) value and Caucasian skin the lowest value. Facial redness (a*) is invariant across the four ethnic groups. (2) Between different body locations, there are significant variations in redness (a*), with the forehead showing the highest redness value and the inner arm the lowest. (3) The colour gamut is smallest in the Chinese sample and largest in the Caucasian sample, with the Chinese gamut lying entirely the Caucasian gamut. Similarly, the largest variability in skin tones is found in the Caucasian group, and the smallest in the Chinese group. Conclusion: Broadly speaking, skin colour variation can be explained by two main factors: individual differences in lightness and yellowness are mostly due to ethnicity, whereas differences in redness are primarily due to different body locations. Variations in lightness are more idiosyncratic probably reflecting the large influence of environmental factors such as exposure to sun. © 2016 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84988027283,"Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) is a specific membrane receptor on the granulosa and theca cells that bind to luteinizing hormone (LH), resulting in androgen and progesterone production. Hence, the regulation of LHR expression is necessary for follicle maturation, ovulation and corpus luteum formation. We examined the immunolocalization of LHR in cyclic gilt ovaries. The ovaries were obtained from 21 gilts aged 326.0 ± 38.7 days and weighing 154.6 ± 15.7 kg. The ovarian tissues were incubated with rabbit anti-LHR polyclonal antibody. The follicles were categorized as primordial, primary, preantral and antral follicles. Ovarian phase was categorized as either follicular or luteal phases. The immunolocalization of LHR was clearly expressed in primary, preantral and antral follicles. LHR immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of granulosa, theca interna and luteal cells. LHR immunostaining was evaluated using imaging software. LHR immunostaining in the theca interna cells in antral follicles was almost twice as intense as that in preantral follicles (65.4% versus 38.3%, P < 0.01). LHR immunostaining was higher in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase (58.6% versus 45.2%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the expression of LHR in the theca interna cells of antral follicles in the follicular phase was higher than in the luteal phase. The expression of LHR in all types of the follicles indicates that LHR may impact follicular development from the primary follicle stage onwards. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"
2-s2.0-84959461157,"Conference calls have become a widely used medium for voluntary corporate disclosure, especially among firms associated with greater information asymmetry, intangible assets, and external competition. These features are common in high-tech sectors, which dominate the Taiwanese economy and render it a useful research setting for investigating whether board interlock, as a social network, affects corporate decisions to hold conference calls. We show that firms connected to conference-call-making firms through interlocked directors are more likely to hold conference calls and the frequency of holding conference calls increases with interlocking directors’ relevant experience. Moreover, such evidence is more pronounced if the connections are held through independent directors and among firms with greater information asymmetry. These results support the argument that the spread of corporate practices is positively associated with board interlock networks. Our findings have implications for the choice of board of director members, and can be generalized to other emerging economies characterized by weaker corporate information environments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-84990942552,"In this paper, a penny-shaped crack in an infinite elastic medium subjected to vertical pressure loading at the crack surface under the influence of surface stress is considered. The Gurtin–Murdoch continuum theory of elastic material surfaces is adopted, and the Hankel integral transform is employed to solve this axisymmetric boundary value problem. A set of simultaneous dual integral equations is solved by employing an appropriate numerical solution scheme. Selected numerical results are presented to portray the influence of the surface stress on the elastic field. Numerical results reveal that the surface stress has a significant influence on both stress and displacement fields. It is also found that the material becomes tougher with the presence of surface stress. In addition, the elastic field also shows size-dependent behavior deviating from the classical crack solution. The solutions presented in this study provide fundamental understanding of the influence of surface stress on fracture mechanics problems. It can also be used as a benchmark solution for the development of numerical techniques, such as FEM and BEM, for analysis of more complicated problems associated with cracks under the influence of surface stress. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien."

The number of freshwater intensive seabass farms in Thailand is increasing annually. Here, we first describe the susceptibility of Asian seabass, which were cultured in freshwater, to Streptococcus inae (SI) and their pathological changes. Three isolates of putative SI were identified using a combination of standard biochemical assays and species-specific PCR prior subjected to in vivo challenge. Accumulated mortalities of the fish which received 107 CFU fish−1 of either SI1J, SI SGSA or SI2J were 90%, 90% and 100% at 7 days-post infection (dpi), respectively, and mortalities increased sharply between 3 and 5 dpi. Clinical signs such as erratic swimming and opaque eyes were identified from a few infected fish, while most died rapidly without any abnormal signs. Histopathological manifestations were observed in the multiple organs (kidney, liver and brain). Haemorrhage, hyperhemia, cellular degeneration and inflammatory cells infiltration were commonly found within the internal organs. Notably, the formation of numerous encyst-like lesion aggregated by eosinophilic cells, resembling macrophages, were typically found in the brain of the infected fish. Summarily, this study first revealed that freshwater reared Asian seabass is highly susceptible to SI infection and haemorrhagic septicaemia was a major pathological change that could be found in the infected fish. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
2-s2.0-84957558259,"Contrary to studies of other migrant-receiving countries, most of which are developed countries, this paper examines impacts of immigrant workers on innovative capacities in Thailand, which is not only a representative of a receiving country that is a developing country but also a country where the majority of its immigrant workers are unskilled. Analysis of firm-level survey data in Thailand finds that employing unskilled and cheap labor from neighboring countries, namely Myanmar, the Lao PDR, and Cambodia, is like adopting a kind of “labor-saving technology” which actually impedes firms’ R&D investment. Contrary to developed countries in which immigrants are found to boost innovation and promote sustainable growth, in Thailand, even though employing unskilled immigrant workers helps firms maintain their cost competitiveness in the short run, its negative impacts on R&D investment tend to hamper improvements in productivity and thus diminish global competitiveness in the long run. Employing skilled or educated migrants, on the other hand, complements technological progress and encourages firms to innovate more quickly. In addition, the paper finds that providing government incentives and promoting access to financing have become effective tools in facilitating Thai firms’ investment in innovation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

The cements used were etch-and-rinse (RelyX Ultimate) and self-adhesive (RelyX U200) resin cements. Compressive load was applied on the ceramic plates using a universal testing machine, and fracture loads were recorded in Newtons (N). Statistical analysis was performed by multiple regression (p < 0.05). Representative specimens were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy to control the cement film thickness. Results: The RelyX Ultimate group with a cement thickness of 100 μm cemented to enamel showed the highest mean fracture load (MFL; 1591 ± 172.59 N). The RelyX Ultimate groups MFLs were significantly higher than the corresponding RelyX U200 groups (p < 0.05), and thinner film cement demonstrated a higher MFL than thicker films (p < 0.05). Bonding to dentin resulted in lower MFL than with enamel (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher fracture loads were related to thinner cement film thickness and RelyX Ultimate resin cement. Bonding to dentin resulted in lower fracture loads than bonding to enamel. Clinical Significance: Reduced resin film thickness could reduce lithium disilicate restoration fracture. Etch-and-rinse resin cements are recommended for cementing on either enamel or dentin, compared with self-adhesive resin cement, for improved fracture resistance. © 2015 by the American College of Prosthodontists"
2-s2.0-84979790113,"A compliant electrode is a stretchable electronic device that retains good conductivity under stretching or bending. It has been used in various electro-actuating applications which require large deformations under electrical field. The objective of this work was to fabricate a compliant electrode possessing high electrical conductivity and good mechanical properties. Due to the excellent mechanical properties of natural rubber (NR), it was used as a matrix for the compliant electrode. Graphene was used as a new and innovative conductive filler to provide excellent electrical conductivity. The mechanical properties and electrical properties were investigated by using a rheometer in the tension mode. Both mechanical and electrical properties were improved drastically by introducing graphene into the matrix. The highest electrical conductivity of 0.61 S/cm was obtained from the 35.0 %vol/vol graphene/NR composite, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the commercial compliant electrode. The 5.0 %vol/vol graphene/NR composite was shown and identified here as a promising material for using as a compliant electrode. POLYM. ENG.

2-s2.0-84940704057,"Princess Mother’s Medical Volunteer (PMMV) Foundation is the most recognized and significant free-of-charge mobile medical service (MMS) provider in Thailand. They require volunteers from partner hospitals to give medical care to poor populations residing in remote areas of the country where access to general medical services is limited. Volunteers usually include four types of staff: doctors, dentists, nurses, and pharmacists. According to their operational plan, the PMMV and their working partners need to properly allocate/assign volunteer medical staff to operation sites according to site requirements. In current planning process, the PMMV has to organize massive amounts of data from different organizations in the country, resulting in a long processing time for allocation decisions. In addition, the current process does not allow decision makers to efficiently allocate medical staff with acceptable transportation cost. There is a significant opportunity to improve this process by using analytical models to support this decision making. Thus, this paper proposes a decision support model for staff allocation. The proposed model is in a form of computer information system (CIS) that is carefully developed to facilitate the access to heterogeneous data and ease of use by decision makers. The proposed CIS will assist the PMMV central offices and partners to manage massive data more efficiently and effectively, while the decision algorithm can facilitate planners to achieve the lowest possible cost associated with their decisions. The outcomes of this research were verified by potential users through a focus group manner. The result showed that the potential users were very satisfied with the overall performance of this system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
2-s2.0-85013176235,"Crystallization processes have been widely used for separation in many fields to provide a high purity product. In this work, dynamic optimization and neural network (NN) have been applied to improve the quality of the product: citric acid. In the dynamic optimization, optimization problems maximizing both crystal yield and crystal size have been formulated. The neural networks have been developed to provide NN models to be used in the formulation of not only neural network inverse control (NNDIC) but also neural network model predictive control (NNMPC) strategies. The Levenberg Marquadt algorithm has been used to train the network and optimal neural network architectures have been determined by a mean squared error (MSE) minimization technique. In addition, a neural network model has been designed to provide estimates of the temperature and the concentration of the crystallizer. These estimates have been incorporated into the NNMPC controller. In the NNDIC controller, another neural network model has been applied to predict the set point of jacket temperature. The simulation results have shown that the obtained crystal size is increased by 19% and 30% compared to that by cooling and evaporation methods respectively and the obtained yield is increased more than 50%. The robustness of the proposed controller is investigated with respect to parameters mismatches.

2-s2.0-85013174135,"Diffusion couples of pure gold and pure tin were created by mechanical cold rolling method. The couples were isothermally treated at temperatures slightly above and below the eutectic temperature near tin-rich region of the equilibrium phase diagram. Differences in the diffusion behaviors were observed as a function of treatment temperatures below (473 K) and above (498 K) the eutectic temperature. At the boundary, it was found that first solid state inter-diffusion was initiated which resulted in local compositional change and solid-state formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). As the composition shifts away towards mixing, the growth of the intermetallic phases was monitored as a function of temperature and time. At temperature above the eutectic, there may be a liquid fraction as the interface isothermally melted. The kinetic involves dissolution of Au atoms into localized tin-rich liquid. At below eutectic temperature, the formation and growth kinetic of phases follows a solid state diffusion mechanism. By investigation the exponent n values in the growth equation l=k(t/t0)n, the values were found to be in between 0.62 - 0.77 which implies that the kinetics of IMC formations experiment are controlled by both diffusion and intermetallic reaction. The bonding time was found to be faster and more reliable at bonding temperature slightly above the eutectic. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85013173967,"A 13.56 MHz RF plasma discharge was successfully utilized to activate and coat Thai silk fabrics with chitosan for durable antibacterial property. Uncolored and untreated Thai silk fabrics were activated in Ar plasma for 5 minutes with an optimized RF power of 120 W under Ar pressure of 0.8 Torr. After plasma activation, specimens were submerged and stirred in a 1% (w/v) chitosan solution. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of chitosan on the silk fabrics. From SEM analysis, chitosan was observed to coat silk fibers almost everywhere. RF plasma treated fabrics were able to absorb the chitosan solution substantially faster than those without the treatment. Another benefit of increased hydrophilicity is the ability of the treated fabrics to allow human perspiration to flow through more effectively, providing additional comfort when worn in tropical-zone countries. Antibacterial properties against E. coli and S. aureus reduced with increasing washing cycles dropping to approximately 95% after 5 rounds of washing. Extrapolation of linear trend lines revealed that for the case of E. coli, it will take approximately 16 washing cycles to reduce the antibacterial ability to 90%. For the case of S. aureus, it will take approximately 10 washing cycles to reduce the antibacterial ability to 90%. Fabrics without RF plasma treatment prior to chitosan solution submersion will have their antibacterial ability for E. coli and S. aureus reduced to 90% after only about 5 washing cycles. Thus, RF plasma treatment can effectively induce chitosan to provide a strong and durable coating for Thai silk fabrics, thus, offering a new, very environmentally-friendly coating technique for Thai silk with chitosan for potential use in the textile industry. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85013157945,"This study aims to demonstrate a simple fabrication technique of freestanding electroplated metallic microstructures by modifying a substrate roughness. The proposed technique utilizes counter effects between two forces, i.e. an intrinsic force causing shrinkage in an electroplated metallic microstructure, and an adhesive force adhering a metallic microstructure to a substrate. With the modification of substrate roughness until the adhesive force becomes weaker than the induced intrinsic force, electroplated metallic microstructures would spontaneously release from the substrate after the electroplating process. Three parameters, i.e. substrate roughness, electroplated square structure’s area and electroplated rectangular structure’s width-to-length ratio, were experimentally studied. The results showed that the electroplated structure with a smaller size and smaller width-to-length ratio was more easily detached from the substrate for a given substrate roughness. In addition, for the same electroplated structure, a substrate with less roughness allowed a detachment of electroplated microstructure more easily. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

2-s2.0-85008604264,"Polydiacetylene (PDA)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite is a class of materials that exhibit reversible thermochromism with controllable color-transition temperature. The nanocomposite also changes color upon exposure to various types of acids and bases. In our continuing efforts to develop this material, we obtain evidences that reveal true nature of the nanocomposite formation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique detects a significant increase of the interlamellar distance within the nanocomposite comparing to that of the pure constituent PDA. The investigation of the nanocomposite systems prepared from 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid and 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid provides consistent results. This indicates an intercalation of the Zn2 + ions, leaking out of the ZnO nanoparticles, between the PDA layers. An atomic absorption spectroscopy confirms the existence of Zn2 + ions in the aqueous solution. The XRD result also shows that using only Zn2 + ions to prepare the nanocomposite can provide the intercalated PDA/Zn2 + structure. However, the enhanced inter- and intrachain interactions within this system is not sufficient to provide reversible thermochromism. An infrared spectroscopy detects the variation of vibrational frequencies of carboxylate head groups within the systems of PDA/ZnO nanocomposite and PDA/Zn2 + assemblies, corresponding to different types of interactions. Therefore, the strong interfacial interaction between PDA head groups and ZnO nanoparticle is essential for obtaining the reversible thermochromism. We also attempt to prepare the nanocomposites by using a combination of Zn2 + ions and various types of substrates including TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85013146773,"The Co/SBA-15 and the Co/SBA-16 catalysts having 20 wt% of cobalt were prepared by the conventional impregnation method. Then, the post-impregnation treatments including vacuum and ultrasound treatments were applied. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by means of N2 physisorption, small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD), wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The results show that the synthesized SBA-15 had hexagonal structure and the synthesized SBA-16 had the cubic structure. The vacuum and the ultrasound treatments after incipient wetness impregnation can apparently enhance the dispersion of cobalt on the SBA-15 catalysts due to the decrease of the metal crystallite size. However, only the vacuum treatment was suitable for the Co/SBA-16. After reduction, no cobalt-silicate compound was detected based on XRD measurement. Both post-impregnation treatments can also decrease the metal-support interaction resulting in increased activity for CO2 hydrogenation under methanation. © 2017, Chulalongkorn University 1.

The effect of the reaction temperature, steam to carbon (S/C) ratio and oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio on the hydrogen production and coke formation of the reformers is analysed. Favourable operating conditions to inhibit carbon formation, to produce low CO concentrations and to achieve high hydrogen yields for the hydrogen production processes coupled with a high-temperature water-gas shift reactor (HT-WGSR) in a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system is also investigated. The results show that an S/C ratio above two is preferred for the bio-oil steam reformer to keep the CO concentration below the maximum allowable limit of the high-temperature PEMFC. However, the CO concentration in the product gas from an HT-WGSR integrated with an autothermal reformer and a partial oxidation reactor is lower than the 5% limit at all temperatures (300–1000 °C), S/C ratios (1–2) and O/C ratios (0.3–1) considered. The efficiency of different bio-oil reforming processes integrated with high-temperature PEMFC systems is studied.

In vitro skin permeation studies indicated that hollow MNs had a superior enhancing effect on skin permeation compared with solid MN patches, electroporation (EP) patches, the combination of MN and EP patches, and untreated skin. Upon using hollow MNs combined with nanocarriers for pOVA delivery, the skin permeation was higher than for the delivery of naked pOVA, as evidenced by the increased amount of pOVA in Franz diffusion cells and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses. When the hollow MNs were used for the delivery of nanocarrier:pOVA complexes into the skin of mice, they induced a stronger IgG immune response than conventional subcutaneous (SC) injections. In addition, immunization of mice with the hollow MNs did not induce signs of skin infection or pinpoint bleeding. Accordingly, the hollow MNs combined with a nanocarrier delivery system is a promising approach for delivering pOVA complexes to the skin for promoting successful immunization. © 2017 Pamornpathomkul et al."

After harvested, the stubs of hemp are left as wastes. Therefore, the added value of this part is considered in this study. Mechanical defibrillation is an interesting method which does not require any harmful chemicals to be involved for size reduction. In this work, high-pressure homogenization by microfluidizer was carried out to defibrillate hemp fibers. Three investigating parameters, which were chemical pretreatment (delignification and hemicellulose removal), fiber concentration, and defibrillation time, were studied. It was found that chemical pretreatment enhanced capability of mechanical defibrillation in which nanofibrillated cellulose could be obtained shortly by microfluidizer (starting from only 15 min defibrillation to obtain 20–50 nm fiber diameters). Higher fiber concentration during defibrillation provided greater degree of polymerization and slightly higher thermal degradation temperature. Meanwhile, longer defibrillation time resulted in smaller and more uniformity of size of nanofibers and provided significant lower degree of polymerization and minor decrease in thermal degradation temperature. However, no significant change on crystallinity was observed. From the obtained results, 0.7% w/v of fiber concentration and 120 min defibrillation time using chemi-mechanical method provided the most uniformity of fiber size and the highest transparency of an aqueous suspension as well as its cast film. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85028270382,"A Measureable, Reportable, and Verifiable (MRV) system is an important tool for tracking the performance of greenhouse gas (GHG)-regulation schemes, especially Emission Trading System (ETS). As a voluntary program, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Trading System (Thailand V-ETS) was established in 2014 as one of important instruments to help reduce GHG emissions. The Thailand V-ETS focuses on the high-intensive energy industry, especially that associated with the petrochemical industry, which has complex of GHG sources with various emission factors. Therefore, MRVs-related activities in the ETS must be urgently developed. The objective of this study was to develop MRV guidelines for the Thailand V-ETS so that factories participating in the system can effectively, consistently, reliably, and compatibly report their GHG emissions. There are currently 7 petrochemical plants participating in this program; GHG emission data from these plants were collected and reported according to the MRV guidelines. A bottom-up perspective of the MRV for the Thailand V-ETS, which was based on data gathered from interviews, meetings, audits, desktop research, and consultations with stakeholders, was provided, and the boundary system, methodologies, and association among schemes were examined. An analysis of these data revealed that the total GHG emissions from petrochemical plants were 7.85 and 7.95 MtCO2 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The data obtained in this study suggest that specific emission factors should be calculated based on the raw data obtained from each petrochemical plant. Scope II (i.e., indirect emissions) data should not be included in GHG emissions reports. Some factories were unable to provide GHG data within a reasonable period. The MRV guidelines tested in this study might improve the reporting of GHG emissions to ETS registries, although some issues must be resolved. In the future, a suitable uncertainty level should be further investigated to improve the quality of GHG data from the factories, which can reflect to the reliability and robustness of the MRV system in the ETS scheme. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85009999737,"A paper-based device, based on the fluorescence switching of water-soluble thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped CdTe QDs, was developed for the simple, rapid and sensitive detection of organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate (CM) insecticides. A new design platform for the developed device was created, comprising a foldable sheet with a detection zone and a buffer solution loading channel, to simplify the multi-step reaction of a bi-enzyme assay with a signal enhancement system. This device was very useful for fast screening and on-site detection, without requiring many reagents. The bi-enzyme includes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline oxidase (ChOx) and TGA-capped CdTe QDs, which were coated on the paper-based device at the detection zone in a separated sheet, starting with an acetylcholine (ACh) substrate coating. After incubation of the sample at the detection zone, the device was closed to initiate enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the pre-spotted ACh. Subsequently, the buffer solution was applied to the device, allowing for the pre-spotted chemicals to mix well and importantly, result in signal enhancement. The hydrolysis of ACh was catalyzed by AChE followed by ChOx to yield H2O2, which can quench the fluorescence of the TGA-capped CdTe QDs. In the presence of OP and CM insecticides, the AChE activity was inhibited, resulting in decreased quenching of the TGA-capped CdTe QDs. The change in the fluorescence intensity of the TGA-capped CdTe QDs can be observed using the naked eye under UV-black light. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection for pirimicarb, dichlorvos and carbaryl were found to be 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 ppm, respectively, using visual measurements. This developed device was successfully applied to the detection of OP and CM insecticide residues in agricultural products. The data correlated well with the data obtained using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 17.6 fb-1. This search assumes a minimal flavor violating model in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is a long-lived neutralino or gluino, leading to a signal with jets emanating from displaced vertices. In a sample of events with two displaced vertices, no excess yield above the expectation from standard model processes is observed, and limits are placed on the pair production cross section as a function of mass and lifetime of the neutralino or gluino. At 95% confidence level, the analysis excludes cross sections above approximately 1 fb for neutralinos or gluinos with mass between 400 and 1500 GeV and mean proper decay length between 1 and 30 mm. Gluino masses are excluded below 1 and 1.3 TeV for mean proper decay lengths of 300 μm and 1 mm, respectively, and below 1.4 TeV for the range 2-30 mm.

Several exclusive search regions are defined based on the number of jets and b-tagged jets, the scalar sum of the jet transverse momenta, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum and the transverse momentum of the lepton. The observed event yields in data are consistent with the expected backgrounds from standard model processes. The results are interpreted using two simplified models of supersymmetric particle spectra, both of which describe gluino pair production. In the first model, each gluino decays via a three-body process to top quarks and a neutralino, which is associated with the observed missing transverse momentum in the event. Gluinos with masses up to 1.6 TeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 600 GeV. In the second model, each gluino decays via a three-body process to two light quarks and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a neutralino. The mass of the chargino is taken to be midway between the gluino and neutralino masses.

This entrapment of water droplets can lead to a significant decrease in the yield stress of the deposits, which can cause the deposit to slough-off during wax deposition. This investigation presents the most comprehensive characterization of the entrapment of water droplets by deposit formation with cold finger and flow loop wax deposition experiments. NMR techniques were implemented to characterize the droplet size of the bulk and deposit in order to reveal the relationship between the droplet size of the bulk and the water content of the deposit. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that incorporation of droplets in the deposit lowers the yield stress of the deposit and causes the deposit to slough-off during pipe flow.

In recent decades, high performance steel fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) has been a new achievement in concrete technology. Due to its superior mechanical properties, civil engineers can address the problem of punching shear of thin slabs that are currently widely used in buildings. By processing some studies, researchers have found that the strength capacity of the material before cracking and the post-cracking resistance strongly depend on the orientation of the fibers, which heavily rely on the casting direction and casting method. While most previous studies focused on the effect on the behavior of beams, this research particularly considers how the casting procedures as well as the volume content of the fiber affect the punching shear behavior of flat slabs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85006992960,"Clinical manifestations of malaria infection in vertebrate hosts arise from the multiplication of the asexual stage parasites in the blood, while the gametocytes are responsible for the transmission of the disease. Antimalarial drugs that target the blood stage parasites and transmissible gametocytes are rare, but are essentially needed for the effective control of malaria and for limiting the spread of resistance. Artemisinin and its derivatives are the current first-line antimalarials that are effective against the blood stage parasites and gametocytes, but resistance to artemisinin has now emerged and spread in various malaria endemic areas. Therefore, a novel antimalarial drug, or a new drug combination, is critically needed to overcome this problem. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a relatively new antimalarial compound, tafenoquine (TQ), and a combination of TQ and a low dose of artesunate (ATN) on the in vivo blood stage multiplication, gametocyte development and transmission of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum to the vector Aedes aegypti. The results showed that a 5-d treatment with TQ alone was unable to clear the blood stage parasites, but was capable of reducing the mortality rate, while TQ monotherapy at a high dose of 30 mg/kg was highly effective against the gametocytes and completely blocked the transmission of P. gallinaceum. In addition, the combination therapy of TQ + ATN completely cleared P. gallinaceum blood stages and sped up the gametocyte clearance from chickens, suggesting the synergistic effect of the two drugs. In conclusion, TQ is demonstrated to be effective for limiting avian malaria transmission and may be used in combination with a low dose of ATN for safe and effective treatment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) score and qualities of cylindrical dandruff (CD) were also determined. Demodex mite infest-ations of eyelash samples were screened by both micros-copic examination and semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ● RESULTS: The prevalence of ocular demodicosis as det-ermined by microscopic examination was 42% [Demodex folliculorum (D. folliculorum) 41% and Demodex brevis (D. brevis) 1%]. Among patients who had ocular Demodex infestation, 69% have CD and had an average MGD score of 4; in patients without demodicosis, 15.5% had CD and had an average MGD score of 4.12. Prevalence of ocular demodicosis as determined by semi-nested PCR was 79% (D. folliculorum 78% and D. brevis 1%). ● CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the prevalence of ocular demodicosis in Thailand. Patients with CD also had Demodex mites present. Semi-nested PCR is better than microscopy for Demodex infestation detection. An extensive survey with more representative samples is required to determine the prevalence in the country. © 2017, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

The effectiveness of concomitant carbon ions and cisplatin is unclear. To obtain the information on the mechanisms potentially shared between carbon ions or X-rays and cisplatin, we assessed the correlation of sensitivity to the single treatments. In 20 human cancer cell lines, sensitivity to X-rays strongly correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin, indicating the presence of potentially shared target mechanisms. Interestingly, the correlation of sensitivity to carbon ions and cisplatin was much weaker than that of sensitivity to X-rays and cisplatin, indicating the presence of potentially different target mechanisms between carbon ions and cisplatin. Assessment of clonogenic cell death by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining showed that mitotic catastrophe was more efficiently induced by carbon ions than by the same physical dose of X-rays, while apoptosis and senescence were not. These data indicate that the correlation of sensitivity to carbon ions and cisplatin is weaker than that of sensitivity to X-rays and cisplatin, which are helpful as biological basis to understand the potentially shared mechanism among these treatments. Further investigation is mandatory to elucidate the clinical efficacy of carbon ions and cisplatin combination. © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-84988419028,"In this work, ZnO microspheres-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites were synthesized via a simple solution method and used for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) dye from water under UV light. The SEM and TEM observations demonstrate that the microsphere morphologies of the ZnO microspheres-rGO nanocomposite is composed of ZnO microspheres anchored on rGO sheets, confirming the formation of ZnO microspheres-rGO composites. Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that both of the reduction of GO tight contact between ZnO and rGO are achieved during the high temperature calcination process. During the photocatalytic test, in comparison with ZnO microspheres and P25 TiO2, the ZnO microspheres-rGO nanocomposite shows improved photodegradation of MB dye, because the rGO sheets could reduce the charge recombination in electron-transfer processes. According to the scavenger experiments, the possible MB degradation mechanism is contributed mainly to the generation of active species induced by the photogenerated holes (h + ) and superoxide radicals ([rad]O 2 − ). © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84983740530,"A novel label-free electrochemical immunosensor for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) detection has been developed. The immunosensor has been constructed by immobilization of NGAL capture antibodies to electropolymerized aniline deposited on top of an electrosprayed graphene/polyaniline (G/PANI) modified screen printed carbon electrode. Electrospraying of G/PANI increases the electrode surface area while electropolymerization of aniline increases the number of amino groups (-NH2) for antibody immobilization. The factors affecting the sensor sensitivity (i.e. aniline concentration, scan number and scan rate of electropolymerization) have been optimized. In a prior report, Kannan et al. reported a broad oxidation peak in cyclic voltammetry upon the binding between NGAL with its antibody. In this study, a dramatic increase (58-fold) in the oxidation current upon the binding between NGAL and its antibody is obtained when compared to an unmodified electrode, verifying a substantial improvement in the electrochemical sensitivity of this system. Under optimal conditions, this system exhibits high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 21.1 ng mL−1, wide linearity (50–500 ng mL−1) and high specificity toward NGAL detection from small samples (10 μL). As an example application, the sensor is tested for the detection of NGAL in human urine, and the results correspond well with the values obtained from a standard ELISA. Compared to the ELISA method, our system requires less analysis time (≤30 min/sample), less sample and less operating cost. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85009511178,"Background: KDOQI guideline suggests that nutritional vitamin D should be supplemented in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who have vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. However, there are scarce data regarding the additional benefit of active vitamin D supplement in CKD patients who were receiving nutritional vitamin D supplement. This study was conducted to explore the effect of adding active vitamin D to nutritional vitamin D supplement on proteinuria and kidney function in CKD with vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. Methods: This double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed to answer the above question. Sixty-eight patients with CKD stage 3-4, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 1 g/g, and serum 25OH-D level < 30 ng/mL were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with oral ergocalciferol plus placebo (n = 36) or oral ergocalciferol plus calcitriol (n = 32). Results: The mean baseline values of UPCR of both groups were comparable (3.6 ± 3.8 g/g in combined group and 3.5 ± 3.0 g/g in ergocalciferol group). Following 12-week treatment, there were significant reductions in UPCR from baseline in both groups (2.3 ± 2.1 g/g in combined group and 2.4 ± 2.0 g/g in ergocalciferol group). The percentage reductions in UPCR of both groups were not significantly different. The mean eGFR and blood pressure did not differ between baseline and 12-week follow-up and between both groups. No severe hypercalcemia or serious side effects were noted in both groups. Conclusions: The proteinuria lowering effect of ergocalciferol in CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency was demonstrated. Additional calcitriol supplement did not have more effects on proteinuria. Trial registration: (Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR) 20140929002).

2-s2.0-85010297712,"Background: The AGE-RAGE-oxidative stress (AROS) axis is involved in the onset and progression of metabolic syndrome induced by a high-fructose diet (HFD). PPARγ activation is known to modulate metabolic syndrome; however a systems-level investigation looking at the protective effects of PPARγ activation as related to the AROS axis has not been performed. The aim of this work is to simultaneously characterize multiple molecular parameters within the AROS axis, using samples taken from different body fluids and tissues of a rat model of HFD-induced metabolic syndrome, in the presence or absence of a PPARγ agonist, Rosiglitazone (RGZ). Methods: Rats were fed with 60% HFD for the first half of the treatment duration (21 days) then continued with either HFD alone or HFD plus RGZ for the second half. Results: Rats receiving HFD alone showed metabolic syndrome manifestations including hypertension, dyslipidemia, increased glucose levels and insulin resistance, as well as abnormal kidney and inflammatory parameters. Systolic blood pressure, plasma triglyceride and glucose levels, plasma creatinine, and albuminuria were significantly improved in the presence of RGZ. The following molecular parameters of the AROS axis were significantly upregulated in our rat model: carboxymethyl lysine (CML) in urine and liver; carboxyethyl lysine (CEL) in urine; advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in plasma; receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in liver and kidney; advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in plasma; and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in plasma, liver, and kidney. Conversely, with RGZ administration, the upregulation of AOPP and AGEs in plasma, CML and CEL in urine, RAGE in liver as well as HNE in plasma and liver was significantly counteracted/prevented. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate (i) the systems-level regulatory landscape of HFD-induced metabolic syndrome involving multiple molecular parameters, including HNE, AGEs and their receptor RAGE, and (ii) attenuation of metabolic syndrome by PPARγ modulation. © 2017 The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85010441099,"Objective: This open-label prospective study investigated the effects of paliperidone extended release (ER) on hostility in Thai patients with schizophrenia. Background: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia may be hostile or exhibit aggressive behavior, which can occasion their admission to psychiatric hospital. Antipsychotic medications are often used to treat hostility and aggression in such patients. Paliperidone ER is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, there are no data available for paliperidone ER with regard to its efficacy on hostility and aggression among Thai patients. This study was a part of the PERFEcT study, a 6-month, open-label, multicenter, multicountry, prospective trial to explore the safety, efficacy, and functionality of paliperidone ER tablets. The current study included only the data obtained from Thai participants. Materials and methods: Flexible dosing of paliperidone ER in a range of 3–12 mg/day was used, allowing investigators to adjust the dosage of each subject individually. The 199 Thai patients had a stable Clinical Global Impression – severity score before enrollment. Demographic data were collected at enrollment, and assessments took place at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months postbaseline. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale were used to evaluate efficacy. In this analysis, we report the findings for the specific PANSS factor P7 (hostility) and the PSP subscale disturbing and aggressive behavior. Data were analyzed using paired t-test method to investigate changes in mean PANSS and PSP total and subscale scores. The significance level was set at P˂ 0.05. Results: From a total of 199 Thai patients, 148 patients (74.4%) participated in all visits. There was a significant reduction in mean scores for all total PANSS measures from 1 month onward compared with baseline, as well as ongoing significant reductions in scores from visit to visit. There was a significant reduction in mean hostility score at 2 months (P˂ 0.05), 3 months (P˂ 0.05), and 6 months (P˂ 0.01) (n=148). For the PSP scale, there was a significant across-the-board reduction of mean scores from 3 months onward, including in the disturbing and aggressive behavior subscale (P˂ 0.001) (n=148). Conclusion: Switching from previously unsuccessful antipsychotic treatments to paliperidone ER may be a useful option to reduce hostility and disturbing behavior in patients with schizophrenia. This study in Thai patients is in line with findings in other countries and cultures concerning the management of hostility in patients with schizophrenia. © 2017 Jariyavilas et al."

The presence of different surfactants (sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) or poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)) in electrolyte plays an important role in structural, morphological and supercapacitive properties of polypyrrole/graphene hydrogel (PPy/GH) composite films. Scanning electron microscope analysis demonstrated that the unique design of PPy/GH-PSS morphology is not only to control micro/nanostructure of PPy wrapped GH, but also to develop the nanostructure morphology of PPy matrix. A large surface area of GH-PSS with the preserving decent electronic conductivity of PPy/GH-PSS composite expected to support the facile ionic transport is investigated. The results revealed that these features endow PPy/GH-PSS composite film electrode with the excellent electrochemical properties such as the high specific capacitance of 640.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and energy density of 68.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 438.5 W kg−1, suggesting of its extensive potential application for the flexible thin film supercapacitors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85011064155,"Background: Dating apps play a major role in connecting men who are interested in meeting other men for sex. Besides finding a partner, these tools are also exploited for other activities such as encouraging people to get involved in the habit of illicit drug consumption (substance use). Methods: This study evaluated the overall usage of dating apps among Thai men who have sex with men (MSMs), with an emphasis on abusing these apps to convey messages encouraging substance use. A well-structured Survey Monkey questionnaire posted on specialized websites and social sites used by MSMs was used to collect the data. Data were analyzed using regression and correlation analysis in order to establish the relationship between variables. Results: A substantial proportion (73%) of the Thai MSM community is using dating apps to find their partners as well as for inviting others into illicit drug practice. Unfortunately, persuasion through dating significantly influenced people toward accepting a substance use invitation, with a 77% invitation success rate. Substance use was also linked with unprotected sex, potentially enhancing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Conclusion: Dating apps significantly increased motivational substance use through messaging from their counterparts. One of the major concerns revealed in this study is that Thai MSMs who reported being involved in substance use also reported avoiding use of condoms during intercourse. © 2017 Boonchutima and Kongchan."
2-s2.0-85008711948,"Background: An early sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (sepsis-AKI) biomarker is currently in needed. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) is a candidate of sepsis-AKI biomarker but with different cut-point values. Urinary exosomal activating transcriptional factor 3 (uATF3) has been mentioned as an interesting biomarker. Methods: We conducted experiments in mice and a prospective, multicenter study in patients as a proof of concept that urine exosome is an interesting biomarker. An early expression of ATF3 in kidney of CD-1 mice at 6 h after cecal ligation and puncture implied the possibility of uATF3 as an early sepsis-AKI biomarker. Increase serum creatinine (Scr) ≥0.3 mg/dL from the baseline was used as an AKI diagnosis and urine was analyzed for uATF3 and uNGAL. Patients with baseline Scr at admission ≥1.5 mg/dL were excluded. Results: The analysis showed higher Scr, uNGAL and uATF3 in patients with sepsis-AKI in comparison with patients with sepsis-non-AKI and healthy volunteers. A fair correlation, r2 = 0.47, between uATF3 and uNGAL was showed in sepsis-AKI group with Scr ≥2 mg/dL. To see if uATF3 could be an early sepsis-AKI biomarker, urine sample was collected daily during the first week of the admission. In sepsis-AKI and sepsis-non-AKI groups, uNGAL were 367 ± 43 ng/mL and 183 ± 23 ng/mL, respectively; and uATF3 were 19 ± 4 ng/mL and 1.4 ± 0.8 ng/mL, respectively. With the mean value of uNGAL and uATF3 in sepsis AKI as a cut-off level, AUROC of uNGAL and uATF3 were 64% (95% CI 0.54 to 0.74) and 84% (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91), respectively. Conclusions: Urine exosome is an interesting source of urine biomarker and uATF3 is an interesting sepsis-AKI biomarker. © 2017 The Author(s)."

2-s2.0-85009193566,"Dysfunctional polymorphisms of FcγRIIb, an inhibitory receptor, are associated with Systemic Lupus Erythaematosus (SLE). Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection in SLE, perhaps due to the de novo immune defect. We investigated cryptococcosis in the FcγRIIb-/- mouse-lupus-model. Mortality, after intravenous C. neoformans-induced cryptococcosis, in young (8-week-old) and older (24-week-old) FcγRIIb-/- mice, was higher than in age-matched wild-types. Severe cryptococcosis in the FcγRIIb-/- mice was demonstrated by high fungal burdens in the internal organs with histological cryptococcoma-like lesions and high levels of TNF-α and IL-6, but not IL-10. Interestingly, FcγRIIb-/- macrophages demonstrated more prominent phagocytosis but did not differ in killing activity in vitro and the striking TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 levels, compared to wild-type cells. Indeed, in vivo macrophage depletion with liposomal clodronate attenuated the fungal burdens in FcγRIIb-/- mice, but not wild-type mice. When administered to wild-type mice, FcγRIIb-/- macrophages with phagocytosed Cryptococcus resulted in higher fungal burdens than FcγRIIb+/+ macrophages with phagocytosed Cryptococcus. These results support, at least in part, a model whereby, in FcγRIIb-/- mice, enhanced C. neoformans transmigration occurs through infected macrophages. In summary, prominent phagocytosis, with limited effective killing activity, and high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by FcγRIIb-/- macrophages were correlated with more severe cryptococcosis in FcγRIIb-/- mice. © The Author(s) 2017."
2-s2.0-85008226749,"Background: We aimed to examine the burden of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in Thailand and identify the prognostic factors for all-causes of death. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of ICC patients admitted during 2009-2013 using the Nationwide Hospital Admission Database, the National Health Security Office (NHSO). There was an average of 1,051,146 patients/year with diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases (GI). All patients with a diagnosis of ICC (ICD10- C221) were included from a total of 72,479 admissions from 858 hospitals. The surgical resection procedures such as the radical pancreaticoduodenectomy, subtotal and partial hepatectomy were analyzed. Data for all patients were censored 1 year post-study or death, whichever came first. Results: A total of 34,325 patients with ICC during a 5-year study period (on average, 6865 patients/year, with the incidence rate of 14.6 per 100,000 population, per year. The ICC patients had a mean age of 63.8+/-11.6 years and 63% were males. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.4+/-7.3 days with a mean+/-SD cost of hospitalization of $595+/-$1160 USD per admission. There were 659 patients (1.9%) underwent surgical resection. The overall survival of ICC patients with surgery was significantly better than those patients without surgery. Hazard ratio of death for patients without surgery was 2.5 (95% CI of 2.3-2.7). Approximately 14% of the ICC patients died during hospitalization. The median overall survival of all patients after the first admission was 53 +/-0.6 days. From the multivariate analysis, factors related to all-causes of death were: patients' age >60 years (OR = 1.2, 95% CI; 1.1-1.3), length of hospital stay of >7 days (OR = 1.1, 95% CI; 1.02-1.2), male (OR = 1.3, 95% CI; 1.2-1.4), living in the northern part of Thailand (OR = 1.5, 95% CI; 1.3-1.8) and presence of complications during admission (OR = 1.3, 95% CI; 1.1-1.5).

2-s2.0-85009412369,"The design and analysis of an integrated biomass gasification and PEMFC system to generate heat and power demand for residential applications are presented in this study. Two biomass gasification configurations using sawdust as a feedstock are considered: air–steam biomass gasification (AS-BG-PEMFC) and steam-only biomass gasification (SO-BG-PEMFC). The biomass processing consists of a biomass gasification which is used to produce H2-rich gas (syngas), followed by high- and low-temperature shift reactors and a preferential oxidation reactor. Pinch analysis is performed to evaluate and design a heat-exchanger network in the two biomass gasification systems. The remaining useful heat is recovered and employed for a reactant preparation step and for a heating utility system in a household. The simulation results indicate that the SO-BG-PEMFC generates syngas with a greater H2content than the AS-BG-PEMFC, resulting in higher fuel processor and electric efficiencies. However, the AS-BG-PEMFC provides a higher thermal efficiency because a high-temperature gaseous product is obtained, and more energy is thereby recovered to the system. The total heat and power efficiencies of the AS-BG-PEMFC and the SO-BG-PEMFC are 83% and 70%, respectively. The Sankey diagram of energy flows reveals that the performance improvement depends entirely on the utilization of useful energy in the exhaust gas. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"
2-s2.0-85003591348,"We give a solution to the long-standing problem of constructing the generators of hidden symmetries of the quantum Higgs oscillator, a particle on a d-sphere moving in a central potential varying as the inverse cosine-squared of the polar angle. This superintegrable system is known to possess a rich algebraic structure, including a hidden SU(d) symmetry that can be deduced from classical conserved quantities and degeneracies of the quantum spectrum. The quantum generators of this SU(d) have not been constructed thus far, except at d = 2, and naive quantization of classical conserved quantities leads to deformed Lie algebras with quadratic terms in the commutation relations. The nonlocal generators we obtain here satisfy the standard su(d) Lie algebra, and their construction relies on a recently discovered realization of the conformal algebra, which contains a complete set of raising and lowering operators for the Higgs oscillator. This operator structure has emerged from a relation between the Higgs oscillator Schrödinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. From such a point-of-view, constructing the hidden symmetry generators reduces to manipulations within the abstract conformal algebra so(d, 2). © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd."

A recombinant live, attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, JE-CV, is licensed in 14 countries, including Thailand, for the prevention of Japanese encephalitis in adults and children. Methods This was a prospective, phase IV, open-label, multicentre, safety study of JE-CV conducted from November 2013 to April 2015, to evaluate rare serious adverse events (AEs). JE-CV was administered to 10,000 healthy children aged 9 months to <5 years in Thailand as a primary (Group 1) or booster (Group 2) vaccination. Serious AEs (SAEs), including AEs of special interest, up to 60 days after administration were evaluated. Immediate Grade 3 systemic AEs up to 30 min after JE-CV administration were also described. Results The median age of participants was 1.1 years in Group 1 and 3.8 years in Group 2. SAEs were reported in 204 (3.0%) participants in Group 1 and 59 (1.9%) participants in Group 2. Among a total of 294 SAEs in 263 participants, only three events occurring in two participants were considered related to vaccination. All three cases were moderate urticaria, none of which met the definition of AEs of special interest for hypersensitivity. AEs of special interest were reported in 28 (0.4%) participants in Group 1 and 4 (0.1%) participants in Group 2; none were considered related to vaccination. Febrile convulsion was the most frequently reported AE of special interest: 25 (0.4%) participants in Group 1; and 2 (<0.1%) in Group 2. There were no cases of Japanese encephalitis reported. No Grade 3 immediate systemic AEs were reported after any JE-CV vaccination. Conclusions Our study did not identify any new safety concerns with JE-CV and confirms its good safety profile.

2-s2.0-84983527168,"Loss of platelet quality during ex vivo storage is a major concern in the transfusion medicine field and it has been known that platelet mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with storage time. In the last decade, small noncoding RNAs also known as microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate key cellular processes through their target sequence interactions with selected mRNAs. In this study, we focused on understanding the mechanisms of platelet mitochondrial dysfunction during storage through miRNA regulation of mRNAs. RNA was isolated from day 0, day 5, and day 9 of stored human leukocyte-depleted platelets and subjected to differential miRNA and mRNA profiling. The miRNA profiling identified several miRNAs at low levels including a set of 12 different miR-548 family members (miR-548a-3p, miR-548aa, miR-548x, miR-548ac, miR-548c-3p, miR-603, miR-548aj, miR-548ae, miR-548z, miR-548u, miR-548al, and miR-570-3p). The mRNA profiling identified, among many, the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit g (ATP5L) mRNA at high levels during storage. Target Scan algorithm for potential targets of miR-570-3p also identified ATP5L as one of its targets. We further identified two target sites for miR-570-3p in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of ATP5L mRNA. While ATP5L is a subunit of F0ATPase complex, its function is not established yet. Overexpression of miR-570-3p in platelets resulted in reduced levels of ATP5L mRNA and concomitant ATP loss. These experimental results provide first-time insights into the miRNA–mRNA interactions underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in ex vivo stored platelets and warrants further investigation. © 2016 Taylor & Francis."

OBJECTIVE To compare the overall response rate and assess the safety of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar plus a taxane or trastuzumab plus a taxane in patients without prior treatment for ERBB2-positivemetastatic breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, phase 3 equivalence study in patients with metastatic breast cancer. From December 2012 to August 2015, 500 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a proposed biosimilar or trastuzumab plus a taxane. Chemotherapy was administered for at least 24 weeks followed by antibody alone until unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occurred. INTERVENTIONS Proposed biosimilar (n = 230) or trastuzumab (n = 228) with a taxane. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewasweek 24 overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete or partial response. Equivalence boundaries were 0.81 to 1.24 with a 90% CI for ORR ratio (proposed biosimilar/trastuzumab) and -15%to 15%with a 95% CI for ORR difference.

2-s2.0-84992360844,"This article considers the problem of choosing between two treatments that have binary outcomes with unknown success probabilities p1 and p2. The choice is based upon the information provided by two observations X1 ∼ B(n1, p1) and X2 ∼ B(n2, p2) from independent binomial distributions. Standard approaches to this problem utilize basic statistical inference methodologies such as hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for the difference p1 − p2 of the success probabilities. However, in this article the analysis of win-probabilities is considered. If X*1 represents a potential future observation from Treatment 1 while X*2 represents a potential future observation from Treatment 2, win-probabilities are defined in terms of the comparisons of X*1 and X*2. These win-probabilities provide a direct assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of choosing either treatment for one future application, and their interpretation can be combined with other factors such as costs, side-effects, and the availabilities of the two treatments. In this article, it is shown how confidence intervals for the win-probabilities can be constructed, and examples of their use are provided.

This information can be useful in helping decide which of the two treatments to adopt, and can be combined with other factors relevant to a practitioner such as the availabilities, costs and side-effects of the two treatments. A methodology employing joint confidence sets is developed which not only allows estimation and confidence interval construction for the win-probabilities, but at the same guaranteed confidence level also tests whether Weibull distributions are appropriate for the data, identifies any common Weibull distributions for the two processes and also provides individual inferences for the two Weibull distributions. Examples are given to illustrate the implementation and application of this methodology, for which R computer code is available from the authors. This methodology can be extended to different models such as other two-parameter and three-parameter Weibull models, and to the comparison of three or more Weibull distributions. >© 2016 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management."

Fansubbing, or the amateur production of multilingual subtitles for media such as movies and songs, is one way by which they may accomplish this. Whether fansubbing can be used by teachers as a means by which learners can use English to make worthwhile contributions to the worldwide conversation on topics they have a personal interest in, however, cannot yet be definitively concluded. The goal of this exploratory questionnaire study was to gather data regarding fansubbers' engagement in fansubbing, their opinions on this activity in general, and their view of it being adopted for language learning, in order to determine its potential for implementation as a language learning activity. It was found that the majority of the questionnaire respondents agreed with the use of fansubbing as a language learning activity, and that they themselves felt engaging in fansubbing benefited them both linguistically and socially. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."
2-s2.0-85129496444,"This article aims to present and analyze teaching and learning situations using the concept of green chemistry along with the expected obstacles and also the interest in teaching and learning based on this concept to provide maximum benefits to students and generations of chemists. A practical approach to the successful teaching of green chemistry includes four aspects: 1) designing courses by interpolating green chemistry concepts in basic subjects; 2) using real-world case studies; 3) qualitative and quantitative measuring by focusing assessment and decision-making skills; and 4) providing the availability of learning resources such as instructors, textbooks, and laboratories. The teaching situations based on the concept of green chemistry occur mainly in higher education. However, there are some limitations such as the lack of accessible information for teachers or students on the concept of green chemistry. The concept of green chemistry to describe chemical synthesis is not included in textbooks and is invisible in the undergraduate curriculum. For basic education such as secondary school level in the USA, the development of green chemistry is apparent in teaching at the K-12 levels. Nevertheless, this concept has still not been explicitly recognized in the basic education curriculum in Thailand. Most teaching of the green chemistry concept comes from a partnership between government agencies and private organizations through various projects. © 2017, Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute.

2-s2.0-85119605695,"The actual sizes of precast anaerobic digestion tanks (600 dm3) combined with food waste disposer systems (PAD-FWD) were selected to investigate efficiency under actual use conditions. The effects of organic loading rates (OLRs) and the presence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) surfactants in dishwashing liquid on the organic removal efficiency and biogas generation of PAD-FWD were stud-ied. According to the findings, the PAD-FWD at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3·day) and hydraulic reten-tion time (HRT) of 12 days could be applied to treat food waste without adding any nutrients to the system to effectively produce biogas. Under operating conditions of the LAS concentration of 63.4 mg/dm3, PAD-FWD was able to reach a steady-state condition with a performance similar to the system without added LAS. The quality of effluent from the PAD-FWD system was unable to meet the effluent standard for households; thus, this effluent should be collected for treatment in a secondary wastewater treatment plant (WTP) before release into the environment. The effluent quality at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3·day) was in the range of the influent properties of the central WTP, which ensures that the pollutants in the effluent do not increase the overall burden on the WTP. The bio-sludge from PAD-FWD was not a sufficient nutrient source for the growing plants. However, the germination index (GI) of the effluent at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3·day) did meet the fertilizer standard. The results of this study can be applied to develop self-management of food waste technology to encourage the sep-aration of food waste at the origin within households. © 2017 Technical University of Wroclaw.

2-s2.0-85101633865,"As global environmental and humanitarian issues exacerbate, leaders and nations are striving hard to tackle these challenges at a global level collaboratively. With the setting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its 2030 Agenda, the role of business in economic, social and environmental development has never been more imperative. In fact, companies have connected sustainable development (SD) practices to their own business initiatives. To support this trend, the Organization for Economic Co-ordination and Development (OECD) has recently developed a set of guidelines for the private sector to initiate responsible business practices. Globally, the trend points to businesses being more accountable, responsible and putting more emphasis on sustainability. Motivations to engage in sustainable practices vary. When companies integrate sustainability into their business, the management of these initiatives needs to be integrated as well. Certain tools and guidelines exist for companies to help support the internal management of sustainability, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). However, there is little research on how companies formulate their SD goals and objectives, set priorities and measure the impacts of these initiatives. Doing so would increase their transparency and help convey meaningful information to their stakeholders. This chapter provides a critical analysis of how companies from five different countries integrate SDGs into their business activities. Each of these countries faces different, as well as similar types of sustainability challenges. The five countries that have been included in this research project are as follows: Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. The authors conclude that the private sector lacks strategy when they plan for integrating sustainability. © 2017 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
2-s2.0-85074993734,"Background: Trigonostemon reidioides roots have been used as a Thai traditional medicine for the treatment of drug addiction; however, the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the herbal extract on human cells have not been clarified. Objective: To evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the ethanolic extract of T. reidioides roots (TR) on human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Material and Method: Cell viability of TR (0.005 to 0.5 mg/mL)-treated Caco-2 cells was measured by MTT assay after 24 and 48 h exposure. DNA fragmentation was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining and comet assay was conducted in the cells treated with TR at the concentrations equal to and higher than the IC50. The protein expressions of ERK1/2 as well as pERK1/ 2 were investigated by immunoblotting. Densitometric analysis of thin layer chromatography (TLC) fingerprint of TR was performed to identify scopoletin content. Results: Exposure of the human Caco-2 cells to TR resulted in decreased cell viability with an IC50 value of approximately 0.2 mg/mL. Treatment of the cells with TR (0.01 mg/mL) for 24 h and 48 h significantly increased (p<0.05) cell proliferation. TR at the concentration of IC50 induced DNA fragmentation, and TR (0.2 to 0.5 mg/mL) significantly increased the percentage of DNA in the tail in a concentration-dependent manner as revealed by comet assay. Immunoblotting revealed that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the cells treated with TR (0.5 mg/mL) when compared with the control. Scopoletin content in TLC was approximately 271 ng per mg of extract. Conclusion: The present study contributes current evidence that caution must be practiced concerning the dose and duration of T. reidioides root medication. Moreover, further study in animal models concerning its safety application is required to confirm the finding in the cellular level of the present study. © 2017 Medical Association of Thailand.

2-s2.0-85079872439,"Understanding the effects of climate change on the economy is critically important to policy design for adaptation and mitigation. Climate change impacts on agriculture are well-known. However, many developing countries, including Thailand, are experiencing a structural change from agricultural to non-agrarian economies and the influence of climate change on national economic growth may be difficult to discern. Here, we adopted a Structural Vector Autoregressive framework to investigate the impacts of rainfall and temperature anomalies on the growth of agricultural, manufacturing and total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Thailand using available quarterly data covering recent 24 years. Results showed that increased rainfall brought an increase in agricultural GDP growth while rising temperature decreased manufacturing GDP growth. Total GDP growth was affected by the lags of itself, rather than climate variables. These empirical results may provide useful information for policy makers and others who devise plans for climate change adaptation for Thailand. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."
2-s2.0-85074982759,"Background: Flavonol quercetin has beneficial effects for promoting epithelial barrier function in intestinal and airway epithelium; however, information is limited regarding its effects on the endometrium. Objective: We investigated the potential effect of quercetin on epithelial barrier function and its protective effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced disruption of barrier function in endometrial epithelial cells. Material and Method: Immortalized porcine endometrial epithelial cells grown on porous membrane filters were treated with different concentrations of quercetin or LPS for 24 to 48 h. In experiments with LPS stimulation, the cells were treated with quercetin for 24 h prior to addition of LPS and further incubation for 24 h. The endometrial barrier function was assessed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4) flux. Results: Quercetin (1, 10 and 100 μM) concentration-dependently increased TER within the first hour reflecting increased membrane integrity, whereas high concentration (200 μM) significantly decreased TER at the first hour and persisted up to 48 h. However, the paracellular FD-4 transport was decreased by 1 and 100 μM quercetin. LPS exposure significantly disrupted endometrial barrier function as evidenced by decreased TER and increased FD-4 fluxes. This LPS-mediated barrier disruption was significantly reversed by pretreatment with quercetin at 1 and 10 μM. Conclusion: Quercetin at concentrations less than 100 μM has a potential role in preserving endometrial epithelial barrier function. The reversibility effect of quercetin on endometrial barrier disruption induced by bacterial endotoxin could be considered of using quercetin to protect endometrial barrier against bacterial infection. © 2017 Medical Association of Thailand.

The concern factors are incorporated into four main groups: (1) company profile; (2) finance; (3) opportunities; and (4) risk perceptions. The paper examines the different perceptions by the public and private sectors about these concern factors adopted by experienced professionals related to PPP transportation projects. Based on a questionnaire survey in Vietnam, the most concern factors of private investors are their own capacity, demand issues, legal and political risks, long-term income, and financial sources issues of the PPP project. Moreover, five factors that represent the significant differences between the private and public sectors including political risks, enhancement of company's strength in its industry, construction risks, demand issues, and financial viability of the company are also discovered. Addressing the different perceptions is indispensable to ensure the public sector can establish necessary policies that appeal to both domestic and foreign private investors.

2-s2.0-85073551609,"The rapidly increasing demand and the inefficacy of financing transportation infrastructure project investments have contributed to various challenges for Vietnam in recent decades. Since the country's budget is inadequate for investing in all necessary infrastructure projects, the Vietnam government has been inviting other economic sectors, especially the private sector, to participate in infrastructure development. The cooperation between the government agencies and the private entities, called Public-Private Partnership (PPP), must encounter various challenges leading to difficulties in attracting private investors. A main reason is that private investors must deal with critical risks concerning PPP investment environment. It is a challenging task for the government to optimally manage such risks to enhance the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors. This paper examines the critical risk factors that influence the private sector's investment decisions on PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Risk factors inherent in typical PPP projects were compiled by comprehensive literature review. To reflect unique characteristics of PPP projects in Vietnam, the compiled risk factors were reviewed by a group of PPP experts from both the public and private sectors in Vietnam through in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys. In addition, ten PPP project case studies in Vietnam were analyzed to derive the risk profile of PPP transportation projects of the nation. These risk factors were quantitatively assessed based on their probabilities and impact levels. We found that the critical risk factors of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam are acquisition/compensation problems, approvals and permits, inadequate feasibility studies, finance market issues, subjective evaluation methods, and change in laws and regulations. By performing factor analysis, these critical risk factors were grouped into four categories: (1) bidding process, (2) finance issues, (3) laws and regulations, and (4) project evaluation issues. These critical risk factors represent the obstacles that repel private investors from PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Thus, the Vietnam government agencies should meticulously address these issues to attract both domestic and foreign private investors in PPP projects. © 2017 ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network.

2-s2.0-85064939860,"BACKGROUND: Aging is one of the biggest problems in Southeast Asia due to their rapidly growing population of the older person. Old aging population is usually confined to their homes resulting in poor quality of life (QOL). Music has been found to be the great activity for older peoples with physical, emotional and social disorders hence, it affects on quality of their life. This study explored the music preference among elderly people and their quality of life in the semi-urban of Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing 353 elderly individuals living in the semi-urban area of Thailand. A validated, reliable world health organization quality of life (WHOQOL-OLD) tool was adapted for this study. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with QOL and its six domains with adjusted covariates, and the potential factors including chronic disease, community participation, traditional event participation, the experiences of music listening, and the types of music preference were entered in the model. RESULTS: Findings revealed that more than half of respondents were married female with an average age of 68.92±6.99. Around (80.7%) suffered from chronic diseases and the hypertension was found the highest (66.32%). The quality of life among the elderly was found at the moderate level with the total QOL score of 83.41±SD=10.32. Respondents with chronic diseases have the total QOL score (OR=0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.98). Respondents who preferred to listen to Look Krung (Thai popular classic music) type have the total QOL score (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05), Autonomy Facet(AUT) score (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21), and Intimacy facet(INT) score (OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24) as compared to those who did not listen the music.

Childhood obesity in Thailand has more than doubled since the 1960s and a recent study reported that overweight and obesity in Thais is the 5th highest in Asia. The present study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a life-skills, multicomponent, school-based intervention on child nutritional status. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was conducted in two-groups (control and intervention schools) on 453 students attending grade levels 4-5 in Bangkok. Two schools were selected for control, and two schools for intervention groups. The interventions included education, diet, physical activity (PA), food-environment, school builtenvironment, and life-skills components. Subjects were measured at baseline and at 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant differences in overall healthy practices (+1.5 mean difference, p=0.048), dietary habits, physical activity, lower total cholesterol (TC) levels (-2.43 mean, p=0.019) and higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (+4.06 p=0.028) as compared to the control. A higher reduction of overweight individuals among the intervention group over the intervention period was observed. Physical activity and consumption of vegetables increased while consumption of high-caloric snacks and fast foods decreased in children after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that a multidisciplinary approach in school-based interventions is most likely to be effective in preventing children from becoming overweight in the long term. More research should be conducted on school-based interventions with longer intervention periods and higher sustainability."

It was found that most derivatives could better interact with amino acids in the active site of both types of enzymes than praziquantel. The ligand G03_R1 interaction with both types of enzymes was similar to praziquantel. No interaction of ligands G17_R3 and G17_R4 in the active site of thioredoxin peroxidase was found but they could best interact in the active site of aspartic protease. The ligand G05_R3 could interact with both types of enzymes, and best interact with thioredoxin peroxidase. The interaction energy value of-31.79 was obtained.-CH 2 CH 2 OCH 3 group in ligand G05_R3 bound with amino acids Ser148 and Glu151 in the active site by hydrophobic interaction and the O1 and O33 atoms of this ligand could form hydrogen bonds with the amino acids Ile140 (N) and Thr139 (OG1). Furthermore, the interaction of ligand G05_R3 with aspartic protease was similar to ligands G17_R3 and G17_R4 . The interaction energy value of-39.83 was obtained.

The Thai SMVS contains 14 items as in the original scale and was validated using a sample of 585 employed participants in Thailand. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis are consistent with the conceptual model of vigour as consisting of physical strength, cognitive liveliness, and emotional energy, with a suggestion that a 13-item scale can also be used. As expected, vigour has been found to be conceptually distinct from some similar constructs, and independent from job burnout. Vigour also showed unique predictive effects on employees’ health. These results support the previously-proposed conceptual framework of vigour and indicate crucial roles of positive emotion in the work setting. In concordance with a positive organisational psychology approach, applications of the Thai vigor scale are discussed with respect to its potential for enhancing employees’ wellbeing and productivity. © The Author(s) 2017."

2-s2.0-85055775227,"Sedimentological and stratigraphic analysis of outcrops and subsurface data in the Mahakam Delta province, combined with concepts of transgressive sedimentary processes derived from a study of the modern Mahakam Delta, indicate that a significant portion of the palaeo- Mahakam Delta succession was deposited during transgressive phases. Some of the transgressive successions resulted from major transgressions and are regionally extensive, but many reflect small, short-lived transgressions within dominantly progradational phases. Two sandstone facies with significant reservoir potential are common within the transgressive successions. Backfilled distributary sandstones occur in outcrop as 10-20 m thick, fining-upward channel sands that become more marine upward and in the subsurface as elongate, coastline-perpendicular sand bodies with a back-stepping stratigraphic architecture and highly variable thickness. Transgressive shoreline sandstones also fine upward, but they are shoreline-parallel, their lateral extent is controlled by the pre-transgression delta morphology and their thickness depends on the rate of relative sea-level rise. Both types of transgressive sandstone can be difficult to distinguish from specific progradational sandstones with wireline log data, especially when they occur within predominantly progradational successions. However, their sand body geometries, volumetrics and connectivity are much different from the stratigraphically adjacent sandstones deposited during progradational phases of deltaic deposition. © 2017 The Author(s).

This study predicted the parameters that affected the liquid yield and the highest selectivity for naphtha. The optimal operating conditions were a temperature of 390°C, a hydrogen gas pressure of 3 bars, a reaction time of 60 minutes and MgO catalyst content of 0.5 wt%. These conditions gave a yield of 85.33 wt% and 32.04 wt% liquid fuel and naphtha, respectively. From an analysis with a simulated distillation gas chromatograph and a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, the distribution of liquid fuel was found to be C5-C12 aliphatic hydrocarbon molecules, 9.49 wt% alkane and 50.62 wt% alkene. FT-IR analysis showed C-H (stretching) indicating the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds (among the main functional groups), represented by the obvious peak at 2850-3000 cm-1. The physicochemical parameters identified pyrolysis oil, which has an acidity of 1.49 mgKOH/mg and a heating value and kinematic viscosity of 44.93 MJkg-1 and 0.99 mm2s-1, respectively. The temperature contributed to the decomposition of triglyceride acid by secondary catalytic cracking, and the acid active sites on MgO produced a biofuel that was used as an alternative fuel. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were also determined to be second order. The activation energy (Ea) and the pre-exponential factor (A) from an Arrhenius relationship were also defined as 71.134 KJ mol-1 and 18.21 s-1, respectively."

The important levels of knowledge in various areas were analyzed and ranked using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and their competency levels were measured using a Relative Level Index (RLI) from the perceptions of primary stakeholders such as contractors, consultants, and project owners. The results of this ranking showed that time, quality, cost, and safety management were the most important knowledge areas for construction PMs in the Lao PDR. However, the relative importance of these knowledge areas for construction PMs was different among the various stakeholders. Moreover, the result of these measurements indicated that the levels of competency of construction PMs in the Lao PDR is medium to low.

2-s2.0-85049994173,"In this paper, the problem of modeling the relationship between the mean atmospheric and air surface temperatures is addressed. Particularly, the major goal is to estimate the model parameters at a regional scale in Thailand. To formulate the relationship between the mean atmospheric and air surface temperatures, a triply modulated cosine function was adopted to model the surface temperature as a periodic function. The surface temperature was then converted to mean atmospheric temperature using a linear function. The parameters of the model were estimated using an extended Kalman filter. Traditionally, radiosonde data is used. In this paper, satellite data from an atmospheric infrared sounder, and advanced microwave sounding unit sensors was used because it is open source data and has global coverage with high temporal resolution. The performance of the proposed model was tested against that of a global model via an accuracy assessment of the computed GNSS-derived PWV. © 2017, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85047752971,"Environmental impacts of the mineral extraction have been a public concern. Presently, there is widespread global interest in the area of mining and its sustainability that focused on the need to shift mining industry to a more sustainable framework. The aim of this study was to systematically assess all possible environmental and climate change related impacts of the limestone quarrying operation in Thailand. By considering the life cycle assessment method, the production processes were divided into three phases: raw material extraction, transportation, and comminution. Both IMPACT 2002+ and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol methods were used. Results of IMPACT 2002+ analysis showed that per 1 ton crushed limestone rock production, the total depletion of resource and GHGs emissions were 79.6 MJ and 2.76 kg CO2 eq., respectively. Regarding to the four damage categories, ‘resources’ and ‘climate change’ categories were the two greatest environmental impacts of the limestone rock production. Diesel fuel and electricity consumption in the mining processes were the main causes of those impacts. For climate change, the unit of CO2 eq. was expressed to quantify the total GHGs emissions. Estimated result was about 3.13 kg CO2 eq. per ton limestone rock product. The results obtained by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol were also similar to IMPACT 2002+ method. Electrical energy consumption was considered as the main driver of GHGs, accounting for approximately 46.8 % of total fossil fuel CO2 emissions. A final point should be noted that data uncertainties in environmental assessment over the complete life cycle of limestone quarrying operation have to be carefully considered. © 2017 Suthirat Kittipongvises."

Material and methods: The data was extracted using a questionnaire administered among 106 public health officers drawn from the Bureau of Risk Communication and Health Behaviour Development, Department of Disease Control (DDC) in Thailand. It was analysed using SPSS version 22 with descriptive statistics and multiple correlation analysis performed to infer findings. Results: A total of 66 women and 40 men participated in this study. No compelling mandate from the government was found demanding public health officers have to interact with Burmese migrants to improve public health knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A significant number of the officers had never interacted with these migrants in conveying HIV/AIDS information. Most of the Burmese migrants experienced major problems receiving information on HIV/AIDS. They preferred the use of group training in the workplace in communicating information about the prevention, causes, spread, and symptoms of HIV/AIDS. Conclusions: Burmese migrant workers have low levels of information about the symptoms, prevention, causes, spread, and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Public health officers should utilise group training in migrants’ workplaces, posters, and flyers in administering intervention programs. © 2017 Termedia Publishing House Ltd. All Rights Reserved."
2-s2.0-85046703749,"Opaline is an unusual group of protists, characterized by the presence of flagella covering their whole body. They reside in the intestinal tracts of various animals, most notably amphibians. While there is a wealth of data regarding the morphological features of opalines, molecular data are extremely sparse. Consequently, the extent of diversity of this understudied group remains unknown. Here, we examine opalines from the intestinal tract of the amphibian Hoplobatrachus rugulosus in Thailand. We provide micrographs obtained from light and scanning electron microscopy of various opalinid morphotypes. Furthermore, we enrich the database of opaline sequences by providing new molecular data of the small subunit ribosomal DNA gene of these species. In our phylogenetic analyses, the newly derived sequences form a cluster sister to Protoopalina. © 2018, Jagiellonian University Press. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85045530106,"Nematode infection in wild caught Phlebotomine sand flies was investigated in Thailand. Light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to detect and morphologically characterize entomopathogenic nematodes that presented in the sand flies. Didilia sp. nematodes were found for the first time in the body cavity of wild caught male Phlebotomus stantoni sand flies. The Didilia sp. was identified based on the morphology of the adult nematodes, from their stylet and teeth at the anterior tip, body length, and egg shell sculpture. It was noted that every infected male sand fly had unrotated genitalia, which would not allow them to mate, thus leading to the loss of their offspring. This finding provided information that might lead to study on whether or not the Didilia sp. has the potential to control sand fly population. © 2017, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

2-s2.0-85044580580,"This essay analyzes the spatial and temporal dynamics which have emerged from the rapid development of Chiang Mai, Thailand over the last four decades. Modern urbanization since the 1980s in the previously remote Chiang Mai-Lamphun Valley has coincided with digital and financial globalization, neo-liberal governance, and the articulation of a new geological era of the Anthropocene based on evidence of human induced climate change. This time frame serves as a lens to theorize the architecture of the “metacity”, a new urban form and new form of urban practice responding to the demands of global digital financial networks and neo-liberal trade policies, but grounded in the ecology and life worlds of particular localities. The metacity appears in Chiang Mai within the interstices of a particularly fragmented rural/urban mix within a self-organized rather than plan-controlled built environment. The entire valley has been the site of intensive inhabitation for centuries, and recently urbanized, yet is spatially heterogeneous, extensive and patchy rather than ordered, bounded and uniform. The resulting landscape is marked by a disjunction between a feudal wet-rice cultivation land tenure structure overlaid with a market-based typology of urban real estate products with little enforcement of land use controls. The essay begins with theorizing the form of the metacity, continues with a description of the Chiang Mai case study, and concludes with a general assessment of the need to create a new form of metacity urban practice. A metacity design practice would re-conceptualize urban theories and forms by inking architectural and ecological thinking with inclusive social practices, enhanced by new digitally-enhanced urban imaginaries and new representational tools of mapping, modeling and design. © 2017 by the authors."

In Thailand, Leishmania martiniquensis and “Leishmania siamensis” have been described as causative agents of leishmaniasis. In this study, a survey of sand flies in the Leishmania infected area of Hang Dong district, Chiang Mai, Thailand was performed using CDC light traps for eight consecutive months, from January to August 2016. A total of 661 sand flies were collected, and of 280 female sand flies, four species of the genus Sergentomyia including Sergentomyia gemmea, S. barraudi, S. indica, and S. hivernus and one species of the genus Phlebotomus, Phlebotomus stantoni, were identified. S. gemmea and S. hivernus were found in Chiang Mai for the first time. The density of captured female sand flies was high in warm and humid periods from June to August, with temperatures of around 26°C and relative humidity about 74%. In addition, S. gemmea was the most predominant species in the area. Further studies as to whether or not these sand fly species could be a vector of Leishmaniasis in Thailand are required. © 2017, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved."

The pharmaceutical properties such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anticancer. The aim of this study is to evaluating antibacterial activity against oral pathogens (i.e., Streptococcus mutans, Straphylococcu saureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) with respect to four different types of A. bunius extraction by water including green fruits, red fruits, black fruits, and leaves. Method: The extracts of A. bunius were examined percent yield, total phenolic compounds, thin layer chromatography and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Result and Conclusion: The percentage of extract yield was found to be the highest in the black fruits (5.20%), followed by red fruits (3.53%) and the leaves (0.71%). The lowest percentage was observed in green fruit (0.47%). The thin-layer chromatography analysis showed a dark spot of gallic acid, the green and red fruit extract was found to have the same Rf value at 0.92.Total phenolic content was highest in the leaves (59 mg GAE g-1) followed by the green fruits (32 mg GAE g-1) and red fruits (26 mg GAE g-1), respectively, whereas the lowest was found in the black fruits (24 mg GAE g-1). Antibacterial activity of the green fruit extract against S. aureus (1.73 cm) was higher than tetracycline (1.05 cm). In contrast, the antibacterial activity against S. pyogenes was not different (2.46 cm for the green fruits was similar to tetracycline), whereas against S. mutans, it was lower (1.96 for the green fruits, 3.86 for tetracycline). Anti-bacterial activity was not observed in the black fruit and leaf extracts. The MIC’s of the green fruit extract were 0.0125 mg ml-1 for S. pyogenes and 0.025 mg ml-1 for both S. mutans and S. aureus. Furthermore, the same results were identical for MBC. Results of the current study indicated that the green and red fruit extracts of A. bunius had had an inhibitory effect on oral pathogenic bacteria. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85043983697,"The International Olympic Committee has adopted Agenda 21 as a countermeasure to the environmental impact caused by sports events. This research addresses its lack of a concrete solid waste management framework by investigating solid waste generated, collected and sorted by the football stadiums in the Thai Premier League. The participation behaviors of spectators were examined by means of a structured questionnaire along with in-depth interviews with key stakeholders in solid waste management. In addition, relevant policies were reviewed. Results suggest that due to the lack of waste separation, less than 15% of the recyclable waste at stadiums proceed to recycling, with the rest going to landfills in the form of commingled solid waste. Carbon dioxide emissions corresponding to the waste produced was estimated by the IPCC's first-order decay method. Field observations suggest that recycling can be increased by means of a prior-sorting behavior, and this was confirmed by the spectator survey. In-depth interviews with key stakeholders underlined the lack of proper incentives, regulations and environmental awareness to support proper solid waste management. We propose a sustainable solid waste management framework comprised of responsive policies, incentives and public participation focusing on the current deficiencies of solid waste management and increasing opportunities for resource recovery and recycling at sporting events. © 2017, Mahidol University, Institute for Population and Social Research."

Materials and Methods: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Clinical outcomes were compared between the lithium clinic (n = 120) and usual care groups (n = 240) between January 2006 and December 2015. Results and Discussion: Average study observation time was 6.11 ± 3.14 years. Hospitalization rate due to any recurrence in lithium clinic group was significantly less than usual care group (2.61 cases per 100 patient-years [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.65–4.14]vs. 9.02 cases per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 7.34–11.04], P < 0.0001). Furthermore, hospitalization rate from manic recurrence and emergency room visit rate in lithium clinic group (2.60 cases per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 1.64–4.13]and 1.89 cases per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 1.10–3.26], respectively) was significantly lower than usual care group (7.40 cases per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 5.96–9.19]and 7.40 cases per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 5.95– 9.20], respectively). Furthermore, lithium clinic group had risk of any recurrence (relative risk [RR]= 0.744, P = 0.02), manic recurrence (RR = 0.613, P = 0.001), and manic admission (RR = 0.439, P = 0.0001) significantly less than usual care group. Median time to manic recurrence was 4.44 (interquartile range [IQR]3.59–5.29) years for lithium clinic group, but 3.54 (IQR 3.08–3.99) years for usual care group. Median time to manic admission was 5.36 (IQR 4.81–5.92) and 3.98 (IQR 3.21–4.76) years for lithium clinic and usual care groups, respectively. Moreover, the median time to emergency room visit was 5.36 (IQR 4.93–5.80) years in lithium clinic and 4.09 (IQR 3.46– 4.72) years in usual care groups. Conclusion: Lithium clinic group had better long-term clinical outcomes than usual care group. Therefore, pharmaceutical care in bipolar disorder patients is beneficial and should be implemented for other psychiatric hospitals. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85043982520,"Creating community identity needs a learning process to help communities identify, recognize and cultivate awareness of their identities, but few models exist. This study, which utilizes the participatory action research approach, highlights a 10-step learning process developed using a social capital-based community empowerment concept to create community identity. Results reveal that bonding social capital and basic capital have the highest potential for empowerment, but human capital and bonding social capital are significant. Mutual planning and decision-making, promoting leadership, encouraging collaborative learning, internal communications, continuous operations, and self-reflecting and evaluating were methods used to empower the community. Community study, analyzing social capital, and determining the community identity were extremely important processes. The most significant factor is people, especially community leaders and local intellectuals. This learning process can be used and applied to other communities with similar contexts. For different areas, indicators in a community study process should be carefully considered and specified in order to make use of resources that currently exist in the target community. © 2017, Mahidol University, Institute for Population and Social Research."
2-s2.0-85043983145,"Objective: We have previously reported on progress toward the refinement of profilometry-based abrasivity testing of dentifrices using a V8 brushing machine and tactile or optical measurement of dentin wear. The general application of this technique may be advanced by demonstration of successful inter-laboratory confirmation of the method. The objective of this study was to explore the capability of different laboratories in the assessment of dentifrice abrasivity using a profilometry-based evaluation technique developed in our Mason laboratories. In addition, we wanted to assess the interchangeability of human and bovine specimens. Methods: Participating laboratories we're instructed in methods associated with Radioactive Dentin Abrasivity-Profilometry Equivalent (RDA-PE) evaluation, including site visits to discuss critical elements of specimen preparation, masking, profilometry scanning, and procedures. Laboratories were likewise instructed on the requirement for demonstration of proportional linearity as a key condition for validation of the technique. Laboratories were provided with four test dentifrices, blinded for testing, with a broad range of abrasivity. In each laboratory, a calibration curve was developed for varying V8 brushing strokes (0,4,000, and 10,000 strokes) with the ISO abrasive standard. Proportional linearity was determined as the ratio of standard abrasion mean depths created with 4,000 and 10,000 strokes (2.5 fold differences). Criteria for successful calibration within the method (established in our Mason laboratory) was set at proportional linearity = 2.5+0.3. RDA-PE was compared to Radiotracer RDA for the four test dentifrices, with the latter obtained by averages from three independent Radiotracer RDA sites. Individual laboratories and their results were compared by 1) proportional linearity and 2) acquired RDA-PE values for test pastes. Results: Five sites participated in the study. One site did not pass proportional linearity objectives. Data for this site are not reported at the request of the researchers. Three of the remaining four sites reported herein tested human dentin and all three met proportional linearity objectives for human dentin. Three of four sites participated in testing bovine dentin and all three met the proportional linearity objectives for bovine dentin. RDA-PE values for test dentifrices were similar between sites. All four sites that met proportional linearity requirement successfully identified the dentifrice formulated above the industry standard 250 RDA (as RDA-PE). The profilometry method showed at least as good reproducibility and differentiation as Radiotracer assessments. It was demonstrated that human and bovine specimens could be used interchangeably. Conclusion: The standardized RDA-PE method was reproduced in multiple laboratories in this inter-laboratory study. Evidence supports that this method is a suitable technique for ISO method 11609 Annex B. © 2017 by the YES Group,Inc. All Rights Reserved."

ENR used in this work was synthesized via in situ epoxidation of natural rubber (NR) in the presence of performic acid generated from the reaction of formic acid and hydrogen peroxide at 50°C for 8 h to acquire the epoxide content of about 40 mol%. Accordingly, the resulting ENR was referred to as ENR 40. The curing characteristics, mechanical properties, thermal behaviors, dynamic mechanical properties, and oil resistance of ENR 40/nSiO2 nanocomposites filled with three loadings of nSiO2 (1, 2, and 3 parts per hundred parts of rubber) were investigated and compared with NR and neat ENR 40. The results revealed that the scorch and cure times of ENR 40/nSiO2 nanocomposites were slightly longer than those of NR but slightly shorter than those of ENR 40. The tensile properties and tear strength for both before and after aging of all ENR 40/nSiO2 nanocomposites were higher than those of ENR 40, while the glass transition temperature, storage modulus at -65°C, thermal stability, and oil resistance of ENR 40/nSiO2 nanocomposites were higher than those of NR and ENR 40. © 2017 Laksamon Raksaksri et al."

Thus, the PBF benchmark using severe accidental analysis codes is essential to designing reactor for current directions. This assessment verified and validated that the RELAP/SCDAPSIM/MOD3.4 code can be used to assess the Severe Fuel Damage Scoping Test (SFD-ST) performed in the PBF facility. This study compares the cladding temperatures and hydrogen production results calculated by the RELAP/SCDAPSIM/MOD3.4 code with experimental data and calculated results from the SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.2 and SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.3 codes. The interested parameters are cladding temperature and hydrogen production since the cladding temperature affects hydrogen production and consequently influences the accident scenario. The calculated cladding temperatures and hydrogen production results from the RELAP/SCDAPSIM/MOD3.4 code are in a good agreement with the experimental data and are generally more reasonable than the calculated results from the SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.2 and SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.3 codes.

Collection of data on mosquito feeding patterns is crucial for developing an effective vector control strategy. The objective of this study was to use molecular biology methods to identify the sources of DNA in mosquito blood meals. The DNA from blood meals in the mosquito stomachs was extracted and amplified with multiplex PCR, using specific primer sets based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, to identify the DNA sources among human, pig, goat, dog, cow, and chicken. Among the 297 mosquito samples collected in the Songkhla province of Thailand, in Aedes spp. mosquitoes the percentages positive for human, dog, pig, chicken, cow, a mixture of 2 vertebrate DNAs, or of 3, and negative (no identified DNA) were 61.90, 2.38, 2.38, 0.60, 0.60, 4.18, 1.20 and 26.79% respectively. In Culex spp. blood meals the rank order was different: fractions positive for chicken, human, dog, cow, goat, pig, a mixture of 2 or 3 vertebrate DNAs, and negative were 40.83, 10.00, 5.00, 4.17, 1.67, 0.83, 8.32, 3.32 and 25.83% respectively. This study shows that feeding behaviors of the two species differ, with most Aedes spp. blood meals containing human blood, while Culex spp. had primarily consumed chicken blood. An improved understanding of the feeding behaviors of mosquitoes could contribute to new, more effective strategies for the control of mosquito populations. © 2017, Prince of Songkla University.

Two-dimensional finite element limit analysis with a plane strain condition in the direction of pile depth was employed to determine the stability of this problem. Six sections of I-piles were analyzed while parametric studies of each section were performed for a complete range of adhesion factors at the soil-pile interface, from smooth to rough piles, and two loading directions, where the I-pile was loaded normal to its major and minor axes. Failure mechanisms of the I-pile and its lateral capacity are discussed between different loading directions and compared with those of square piles.

2-s2.0-85042285371,"Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that aldosterone rapidly activates sodium-hydrogen exchangers 1 and 3 (NHE 1 and 3). In vitro investigations revealed that protein kinase C (PKC) regulates NHE properties. We previously demonstrated that aldosterone rapidly enhances PKCα protein abundance in the rat kidney. There are no reports of renal PKCβ (I and II) protein levels related to the regulation by aldosterone. There are also no in vivo data regarding the rapid effects of aldosterone on renal protein levels of NHE (1 and 3) and PKCβ (I and II), simultaneously. In the current study, rats received normal saline solution or aldosterone (150 μg/kg BW, i.p.). After 30 minutes, abundance and immunoreactivity of these proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Aldosterone increased NHE1 and NHE3 protein abundance to 152% and 134%, respectively (P<0.05). PKCβI protein level was enhanced by 30%, whereas PKCβII declined slightly. Aldosterone increased NHE protein expression mostly in the medulla. PKCβI immunostaining intensity was increased in the glomeruli, renal vasculature, and thin limb of the loop of Henle, while PKCβII was reduced. This is the first in vivo study to simultaneously demonstrate that aldosterone rapidly elevates PKCβI and NHE (1 and 3) protein abundance in the rat kidney. Aldosterone-induced NHE (1 and 3) protein levels may be related to PKCβI activation. © 2017 Somchit Eiam-Ong et al."

2-s2.0-85042157440,"This study proposes a novel method of Robust Transmission Network Expansion Planning (RTNEP) considering effect of renewable energy generation. The RTNEP problem will be formulated by using an AC Model instead of DC Model in order to obtain more accurate result. The investment cost of transmission lines and operating cost of conventional generators are considered as the objective function of the planning. In order to obtain the robust expansion plan for all possible scenarios of renewable energy generation and loads, the method to select the suitable scenarios as the considered criteria in the planning is proposed. To obtain the optimal expansion plan, a metaheuristic algorithm called Adaptive Tabu Search (ATS) is employed in the proposed RTNEP. With the proposed method, ATS iterates between the main problem which minimizes the investment cost and operating cost and the subproblem which is the process to avoid the violation of system operating constraints by using generation re-dispatch and curtailments of renewable energy generation and loads. The IEEE Reliability Test System 79 (RTS 79) is used to test the proposed method and to study the effect of renewable energy generation on RTNEP. The results show that the proposed RTNEP provides the solution more robust than the previous works and the effect of renewable energy generation on RTNEP is rather high which cannot be neglected in the planning. © Medwell Journals, 2017."

The effects of organic loading rates (OLRs) and the presence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) surfactants in dishwashing liquid on the organic removal efficiency and biogas generation of PAD-FWD were studied. According to the findings, the PAD-FWD at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3day) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 days could be applied to treat food waste without adding any nutrients to the system to effectively produce biogas. Under operating conditions of the LAS concentration of 63.4 mg/dm3, PAD-FWD was able to reach a steady-state condition with a performance similar to the system without added LAS. The quality of effluent from the PAD-FWD system was unable to meet the effluent standard for households; thus, this effluent should be collected for treatment in a secondary wastewater treatment plant (WTP) before release into the environment. The effluent quality at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3day) was in the range of the influent properties of the central WTP, which ensures that the pollutants in the effluent do not increase the overall burden on the WTP. The bio-sludge from PAD-FWD was not a sufficient nutrient source for the growing plants. However, the germination index (GI) of the effluent at an OLR of 0.13 kg VS/(m3day) did meet the fertilizer standard.

However, the increasing temperature has influenced the insect control efficiency of the fungus. Therefore, determination of thermotolerant isolates of B. bassiana that can grow and remain pathogenic at higher temperatures than its current optimum temperature may be a better way to control pest insects in a high temperature environment. Three isolates of B. bassiana obtained from the Rice Department, Thailand were selected for mutagenesis using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with subsequent screening at high temperatures (33 and 35°C). In addition, the recovery of fungal growth after exposure to a high temperature for a period of time (5-15 days) and then transferring to 25°C was evaluated. No isolates were found that grew at 35°C but one mutant isolate (BCNT002MT) produced larger diameter colonies and more spores than the corresponding wild type (WT) at 33°C. Growth and spore production of the BCNT002MT isolate were greater than its WT when incubated at 25°C for 14 days following exposure to 33°C for 7 days. In addition, the spore germination level (%) of BCNT002MT was significantly higher than its WT during culture at 25°C after prior exposure to 33°C for 5, 10 and 15 days.

Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the construct validity of T-DMSES (χ2=645.142, df = 164, p<0.001, CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.065, TLI = 0.977, and AGFI = 0.981). The T-DMSES was also shown to be criterion valid with most subscales highly associated with HbA1c control. Conclusion. The T-DMSES was shown to have good psychometric properties. It is likely to provide valuable insights into the epidemiology of diabetes management self-efficacy and may also prove useful in evaluating interventions for raising diabetes management self-efficacy, which in turn, improve both patient self-management and blood sugar control. © 2017 Monthida Sangruangake et al."
2-s2.0-85040819070,"Morphological, rheological and mechanical properties of various biodegradable poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends via conventional melt blending technique are studied. The morphology, rheology, and tensile properties of the PBS/PBAT blends were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), rotational rheometer, and universal testing machine, respectively. The SEM micrographs of the PBS/PBAT blends reveal an occurrence of phase separation indicating by a presence of spherical particles/cavities for a range of 10 to 30 wt% (i.e. PBS90-PBS70), and 70 to 90 wt% (i.e. PBS30-PBS10) PBT content and co-continuous structure for a range of 40 to 60 wt% (i.e. PBS60-PBS40) PBAT content. The rheological observation reveals that storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G''), and complex viscosity (η*) for the PBS/PBAT lends exhibit similar tendency. The morphological properties of the blends appear to affect the tensile behavior of the PBS/PBAT blends."

2-s2.0-85040095595,"This paper examines the performance of bounded Jacobian and Lipschitz observer design techniques for nonlinear estimation applications. The bounded Jacobian observer technique utilizes the mean value theorem to express the nonlinear estimation error dynamics as a convex combination of known matrices with time varying coefficients. The Lipschitz based observers are the most popular observer design technique used for nonlinear systems. But they are derived from more conservative Lipschitz conditions on the nonlinearity. Both observers are evaluated for longitudinal velocity estimation, vehicle roll angle estimation, and estimation in a polynomial nonlinear system with a large Lipschitz constant. The results show that the bounded Jacobian observer is the more appropriate observer for these problems."
2-s2.0-85040087746,"The role of cardiac autonomic modulation on ventricular arrhythmia, known as ventricular premature complexes (VPC), after splenectomy was investigated. Twelve dogs undergoing splenectomy were divided into 2 groups: low VPC (<1,000/day, n=6) and high VPC groups (≥1,000/day, n=6). Electrocardiograph recording was performed prior to (D0), during the first three days (D1–3) and on day 9 (D9) after surgery. Arrhythmic indices, Tpeak-Tend, corrected QT interval and short-term variability of QT interval as well as heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were measured. In the high VPC group, the occurrences of VPC were significantly increased (P<0.05) after surgery, and reached the levels higher than those in the low VPC group. For the arrhythmic indices, only Tp-Te in the high VPC group increased significantly (P<0.05) after surgery. For HRV analysis, enhancement of both time and frequency domains were found postoperatively in both groups. On D2, however, the high VPC group showed significantly lower total power and high frequency with higher low to high frequency ratio (P<0.05) than the low VPC group. Plasma NE concentration significantly increased in the high VPC group after surgery. Dogs in the high VPC group had shorter survival time than those in the low VPC group. In conclusion, dogs with imbalance cardiac autonomic modulation accompanied with high circulating NE concentration after splenectomy are prone to ventricular arrhythmia, which leads to short survival time. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science."
2-s2.0-85040003809,"Context: Lentinus squarrosulus Mont. (Polyporaceae) is an interesting source of diverse bioactive compounds. Objective: This is the first study of the anticancer activity and underlying mechanism of peptides extracted from Lentinus squarrosuls. Materials and methods: Peptides were isolated from the aqueous extract of L. squarrosulus by employing solid ammonium sulphate precipitation. They were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)-cellulose and gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G25. Anticancer activity was investigated in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells cultured with 0–40 lg/mL of peptide extracts for 24 h. Cell viability and mode of cell death were evaluated by MTT and nuclear staining assay, respectively. Western blotting was used to investigate the alteration of apoptosis-regulating proteins in lung cancer cells treated with peptide extracts (0–20 lg/mL) for 24 h. Results: The cytotoxicity of partially-purified peptide extracts from L. squarrosulus was indicated with IC50 of ~26.84 ± 2.84, 2.80 ± 2.14 and 18.84 ± 0.30 lg/mL in lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells, respectively. The extracts at 20 lg/mL induced apoptosis through the reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (~0.5-fold reduction) and up-regulation of BAX (~4.5-fold induction), a pro-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, L. squarrosulus peptide extracts (20 lg/mL) also decreased the cellular level of death receptor inhibitor c-FLIP (~0.6-fold reduction). Conclusions and discussion: This study provides the novel anticancer activity and mechanism of L. squarrosulus peptide extracts, which encourage further investigation and development of the extracts for anticancer use. © 2017 The Author(s).

Resin-based sealant was incorporated with 5% w/w of the following fillers: calcium aluminate cement (CAC), synthesized mesoporous silica (SI), a CAC and SI mixture (CAC+SI), glass-ionomer powder (GIC), and acetic acid-treated GIC (GICA). Sealant without filler served as control. The samples were immersed in deionized water or a lactic acid solution and the concentration of fluoride in the water, before and after fluoride recharge, and the lactic acid pH change, respectively, were determined. The CAC+SI group demonstrated the highest fluoride release after being recharged with fluoride gel. The CAC+SI group also demonstrated increased lactic acid pH.

In this study, megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) images were used to generate cumulative doses for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients by various DIR methods. The performance of the multiple DIR methods was analysed, and the impact of dose accumulation was assessed. The study consisted of five NPC patients treated with a helical tomotherapy unit. The weekly MVCT images at the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, 26th, and 31st fractions were used to assess the dose accumulation by the four DIR methods. The cumulative dose deviations from the initial treatment plan were analysed, and correlations of these variations with the anatomic changes and DIR methods were explored. The target dose received a slightly different result from the initial plan at the end of the treatment. The organ dose differences increased as the treatment progressed to 6.8% (range: 2.2 to 10.9%), 15.2% (range: -1.7 to 36.3%), and 6.4% (range: -1.6 to 13.2%) for the right parotid, the left parotid, and the spinal cord, respectively. The mean uncertainty values to estimate the accumulated doses for all the DIR methods were 0.21 ± 0.11 Gy (target dose), 1.99 ± 0.76 Gy (right parotid), 1.19 ± 0.24 Gy (left parotid), and 0.41 ± 0.04 Gy (spinal cord). Accuracy of the DIR methods affects the estimation of dose accumulation on both the target dose and the organ dose. The DIR methods provide an adequate dose estimation technique for observation as a result of inter-fractional anatomic changes and are beneficial for adaptive treatment strategies. © 2017 2017 Wannapha Nobnop, Imjai Chitapanarux, Hudsaleark Neamin, Somsak Wanwilairat, Vicharn Lorvidhaya, Taweap Sanghangthum."

According to the plan, the full-scale operation in 2035 requires additional 20 million tons per annum. This unprecedented quantity of sub-bituminous and bituminous coals reflects a strategic challenge as coals must be imported and transported to the plants at competitive logistics costs while minimizing disruption of public transportation and environmental impacts. In addition to this logistics challenge, the plan also faces with local community scrutiny and politics pressures that may delay or even cancel some coal-fired plants. To elaborate these uncertainties, a mixed-integer linear programming is formulated to analyze and assess their impacts by determining suitable modes of transportation and locations of transit facility.

Several recombinant proteins have potential to mediate induction of bone production, however, the high production cost of mammalian cell expression impedes patient access to such treatments. The aim of this study is to produce recombinant human osteopontin (hOPN) in plants for inducing dental bone regeneration. The expression host was Nicotiana benthamiana using a geminiviral vector for transient expression. OPN expression was confirmed by Western blot and ELISA, and OPN was purified using Ni affinity chromatography. Structural analysis indicated that plant-produced hOPN had a structure similar to commercial HEK cell-produced hOPN. Biological function of the plant-produced hOPN was also examined. Human periodontal ligament stem cells were seeded on an OPN-coated surface. The results indicated that cells could grow normally on plant-produced hOPN as compared to commercial HEK cell-produced hOPN determined by MTT assay. Interestingly, increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-related genes, including OSX, DMP1, and Wnt3a, was observed by realtime PCR.

2-s2.0-85037044596,"Background: This study aimed to determine the effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) on bone metabolism and bone mass in HIV-infected adolescents. Methods: This was a sub-study of a cross-sectional multicentre bone health trial that enrolled perinatally HIV-infected Thai and Indonesian adolescents (10–18 years) with viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy. Participants were classified into two groups as TDF users and non-users. Bone metabolism-related markers (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD], intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH], bone turnover biomarkers), and lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were assessed. Bone mineral density (BMD)/bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) Z-scores were calculated. Results: Of 394 adolescents, 136 (34.5%) and 258 (65.5%) were TDF users and non-users, respectively. Among TDF users, median age (IQR) was 16.1 (14.7–17.4) years and TDF treatment duration (IQR) was 2.3 (1.4–3.1) years. Among TDF non-users, median age (IQR) was 14.3 (12.6–16.4) years. BMD and BMAD Z-scores comparing TDF users with non-users were -0.8 and -0.6 (P=0.27), and -0.3 and -0.2 (P=0.58), respectively. The association between TDF use and iPTH elevation was intensified in adolescents with suboptimal vitamin D levels (25-OHD <30 ng/ml; P=0.001). TDF administration was positively associated with bone resorption marker (P=0.04) and negatively associated with bone formation marker (P=0.04). With data up to 4 years, neither association between TDF use and bone mass loss (BMD: P=0.09; BMAD: P=0.22), nor variation of bone mass Z-scores by TDF treatment duration (BMD: P=0.34; BMAD: P=0.58) was demonstrated. Conclusions: Recent TDF administration was correlated with PTH elevation and bone turnover dysregulation but not with bone mass reduction in our cohort.

2-s2.0-85036559393,"Nowadays, Thai elderly have increasingly been using smartphones to communicate with their families. However, the elderly may have problems using smartphones because most of them normally have visual impairment which result in unclear perception of the screen. The test on how user interface (UI) design of the LINE application affects the elderly when using smartphones shows that the elderly spend more time and make more mistakes than the young adults. The analysis was conducted to find the major factors associated with such problems, and the results show that three components of UI; i.e., font, color, and level of brightness are the major factors that affect how the elderly use their smartphones. In order to confirm the test results, several combinations of font, color, and level of brightness were used to create UI of the simulated LINE application and each UI was used to test with a group of 38 elderly (the age of 60-69) who were told to perform eight different actions on the phone. After further research on UI, it is found that the most appropriate font for Thai elderly is Arial Unicode MS with the size of 16 pt., and the green tone of screen with 75% of brightness level is found to be the most appropriate for the elderly. The test results reveal that the elderly could perform seven actions faster and they made fewer mistakes in six actions.

Methods: We conducted a crosssectional study which included a walk-through survey, JSA, occupational risk assessment, and environmental samplings from March through September 2015 at four Para rubber wood sawmills. Results: We identified potential occupational safety and health hazards associated with six main processes, including: 1) logging and cutting, 2) sawing the lumber into sheets, 3) planing and re-arranging, 4) vacuuming and wood preservation, 5) drying and planks re-arranging, and 6) grading, packing, and storing. Working in sawmills was associated with high risk of wood dust and noise exposure, occupational accidents injuring hands and feet, chemicals and fungicide exposure, and injury due to poor ergonomics or repetitive work. Discussion: Several high-risk areas were identified from JSA and hazard identification of the working processes, especially high wood dust and noise exposure when sawing lumber into sheets and risk of occupational accidents of the hands and feet when struck by lumber. All workers were strongly recommended to use personal protective equipment in any working processes. Exposures should be controlled using local ventilation systems and reducing noise transmission.

Many skin disorders appear to be related to the resident microflora, yet databases of facial skin microbiome of many biogeographies, including Thai, are limited. Methods. Metagenomics derived B-RISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to identify the culture-independent bacterial diversity on Thai male faces (cheek and forehead areas). Skin samples were categorized (grouped) into (i) normal (teenage.hea) and (ii) acne-prone (teenage.acn) young adults, and normal (iii) middle-aged (middle.hea) and (iv) elderly (elderly.hea) adults. Results. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was successful as the sequencing depth had an estimated >98% genus coverage of the true community. The major diversity was found between the young and elderly adults in both cheek and forehead areas, followed by that between normal and acne young adults. Detection of representative characteristics indicated that bacteria from the order Rhizobiales, genera Sphingomonas and Pseudoalteromonas, distinguished the elderly.hea microbiota, along the clinical features of wrinkles and pores. Prediction of the metabolic potential revealed reduced metabolic pathways involved in replication and repair, nucleotide metabolism and genetic translation in the elderly.hea compared with that in the teenage.hea. For young adults, some unique compositions such as abundance of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with a minor diversity between normal and acne skins, were detected. The metabolic potentials of the acne vs. normal young adults showed that teenage.acn was low in many cellular processes (e.g., cell motility and environmental adaptation), but high in carbohydrate metabolism, which could support acne growth. Moreover, comparison with the age-matched males from the US (Boulder, Colorado) to gain insight into the diversity across national biogeography, revealed differences in the distribution pattern of species, although common bacteria were present in both biogeographical samples. Furthermore, B-RISA served as a crosscheck result to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing (i.e., differences between teenage and elderly microbiota). Conclusions. This study revealed and compared the microbial diversity on different aged Thai male faces, and included analyses for representing the bacterial flora, the clinical skin characteristics, and comparison with the US age-matched. The results represent the first skin microbiota of Thai males, and helps the design of a large-scale skin microbiome study of Thais. The findings of the diversity among ages, skin type and national biogeography supported the importance of these traits in the skin microbiome and in developing a safe and sustainable treatment for acne and aging skin diseases. 2017 Wilantho et al."

B12 was then successfully decorated onto the drug-loaded particles via coordination to the cobalt center. The obtained particles were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV-vis, SEM and DLS. The particles were spherical and monodisperse with an average diameter of 316 ± 6 nm. In addition, B12 could control the drug release by serving as a gatekeeper to hinder drug leaching during circulation. Under a reducing environment at pH 5.5, the cobalt center in B12 was reduced and cleaved from the particles, which resulted in a significant enhancement of CDDP release. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique."
2-s2.0-85034601570,"Haemophilus influenzae was isolated from 556 different patients, mostly 10 years or under, at a tertiary referral hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during 2012 - 2015. Peak period of detection was from January to March. Thirty-nine percent of the isolates were β-lactamase positive. β-Lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) constituted 2% of β-lactamase-negative cases. H. influenzae was susceptible to ampicillin (58%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (99%), cefotaxime (100%), ceftriaxone (100%), cefuroxime (99%), ciprofloxacin (99%), chloram-phenicol (86%), tetracycline (75%), and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (52%). β-Lactamase-producing isolates (72%) showed high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ampicillin (128-516 µg/ml) and all BLNAR isolates low ampicillin MIC (2-16 µg/ml). These findings indicate that the level of ampicillin resistance in H. influenzae depended on differences in resistance mechanism. © 2017, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85034577755,"Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between mandibular bone structure parameters measured on preimplant cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images and primary implant stability. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one hemimandibles were scanned on the 3D Accuitomo 170 CBCT. Next, an implant was placed in each hemimandible, after which insertion torque and implant stability quotient (ISQ) measurements were acquired. The following measurements were performed on the preimplant CBCT scans: bone surface, bone volume, fractal dimension, connectivity, trabecular thickness and spacing, and skeleton analysis. Measurements were performed using various regions of interest in the vicinity of the implant site. In addition, cortical thickness was measured. The correlation between bone structure parameters, insertion torque, and ISQ was calculated. Results: The overall correlation was low to medium (|R| = 0.002-0.723). For the bone around the entire implant site, the highest correlation with ISQ was found for skeleton analysis and trabecular thickness. The highest overall correlation between bone structure and ISQ was found in the coronal region. For insertion torque, no significant correlation was found for the bone around the entire implant; the highest overall correlation was found in the apical region. The highest number of significant correlations between bone structure and primary implant stability were found for trabecular thickness and fractal dimension. Conclusion: While each of the investigated bone structure parameters can have a predictive value in terms of primary implant stability, they should be measured at specific regions surrounding a planned implant site, and can provide complementary information regarding the local bone quality. © 2017 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc."
2-s2.0-85034586452,"The present study analyzes the everyday rhythms of a ruin in Bangkok, where middle-class residents are in day-to-day contact with the disenfranchised— mostly migrants from northeast Thailand. I study the connections between ruined space, non-hegemonic mobility, the body, and everyday resistance. I do so by comparing and contrasting the bodily comportment of the disenfranchised with the middle class gaze over the ruin. The middle-class gaze is informed by Thai/global notions about what it means to be “civilized,” and it contains a primordial fear of “savagery”. The ruin is felt before it is thought. The fear of the ruin is a fear of ruination, in the sense of losing material wealth and sliding into the lower class. Natural, resistant rhythms emerge as a result of the body’s encounter with modernity. © 2017 The Author(s)."

All catalysts were prepared via the mechanical alloying (MA) technique which is a green process for catalyst preparation. The results showed that the prepared catalysts consisted of monoclinic (Ni3Sn4 and Cu6Sn5) and hexagonal (Ni3Sn and Cu6Sn5(HT)) crystal structures. The catalytic activity of all synthesized catalysts for phenol hydroxylation demonstrated that both Ni3Sn4 and Ni3Sn exhibited better catalytic activity than Cu6Sn5 and Cu6Sn5(HT), and Ni3Sn, having a hexagonal crystal structure, showed the best catalytic activity (>97% conversion) at 363 K, 3 h, 1:4 phenol:H2O2, and 50 mg of catalyst content, giving CAT (60.28% yield) and HQ (36.82% yield) with no over-oxidation of CAT and HQ as time elapsed. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed hyperglycemia and selected associated factors among Thai dental patients. Dental patients without a history of hyperglycemia were recruited from the Special Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and His Majesty the King’s Dental Service Unit, Thailand. The patients were randomly selected and a standardized questionnaire was used to collect demographic data from each patient. Blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were recorded for each subject. The number of missing teeth, periodontal status, and salivary flow rate were also investigated. HbA1c was assessed using a finger prick blood sample and analyzed with a point-of-care testing machine. Hyperglycemia was defined as a HbA1c ≥5.7%. The prevalence of hyperglycemia among participants was calculated and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors. A total of 724 participants were included in the study; 33.8% had hyperglycemia. On multiple logistic regression analysis, older age, family history of DM, being overweight (BMI ≥23 kg/m2), having central obesity and having severe periodontitis were significantly associated with hyperglycemia. The high prevalence of hyperglycemia in this study of dental patients suggests this setting may be appropriate to screen for patients with hyperglycemia. © 2017, SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

2-s2.0-85033467716,"Background. Delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and drug-resistant TB are major challenges of TB control in Thailand. This study assessed the practicality of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in a real-life setting with high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Methods. This prospective study was conducted at 3 large tertiary care hospitals. Patients who had suspected PTB were enrolled into the study. Expectorated sputum samples were sent for staining, mycobacterial culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Results. Four hundred ninety-four patients were enrolled. From 355 cases with final diagnosis of PTB, 263 (71.8%) had definite diagnosis and 92 cases had probable diagnosis. Among TB culture-positive cases, Xpert MTB/RIF had 100% and 81% sensitivity in sputum smear-positive and smear-negative groups, respectively. The specificity was 95.7%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF in culture-negative but clinically diagnosed PTB was 37.8% and 83.8%, respectively. Centrifugation was required in 59% cases with scanty sputum. Five cases were false-positive by Xpert MTB/RIF in patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria, old PTB scar, and immune reconstitution syndrome. Discordant rifampicin susceptibility results of Xpert MTB/RIF and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) were confirmed by using rpoB gene sequencing, which raised the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF in detecting rifampicin resistance to 93.8%. Conclusions. Xpert MTB/RIF is an effective tool in diagnosing PTB but will be more cost-effective for sputum-negative patients and in settings with high prevalence of rifampicin resistance. Early diagnosis of TB results in early treatment and implementation of strategies to limit spreading of TB. Sputum centrifugation may increase the yield of Xpert MTB/RIF. © The Author 2017.

2-s2.0-85034217773,"Fully printable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on an inorganic metal oxide architecture have attracted tremendous attention due to its feature of showing principally high stability. However, fully printable PSCs show a lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the thin film PSCs owing to the thick mesoscopic layers that pose an obstacle to charge collection. Herein, the triple cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2, for the first time, is introduced in fully printable PSCs on the basis of a mesoporous metal oxide TiO2/Al2O3/NiO layered framework with a carbon counter electrode. We found that partial replacement of FA/MA by Cs could increase the bandgap and exciton binding energy of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1-xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite. An optimal efficiency of 17.02% can be obtained using Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 as the light absorber under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm-2 light illumination, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents the highest efficiency observed to date for fully printable PSCs using a carbon counter electrode. Detailed investigations with nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements revealed that the presence of Cs in perovskite compounds can increase the charge carrier lifetime along with diffusion length, benefiting charge transport in thick mesoscopic layers. Furthermore, the Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2-based PSCs exhibit good stability with a retention of over 90% initial PCE after 1020 h in dark conditions at 85 °C. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017."
2-s2.0-85033723072,"Background: Access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has decreased mortality in HIV-positive people. We aimed to estimate the expected additional years of life in HIV-positive Thai people after starting cART through the National AIDS Program (NAP), administered by the Thai National Health Security Office (NHSO). Methods: The NHSO database collects characteristics of all Thai HIV-infected patients through the National AIDS Program, including linkage with the National Death Registry for vital status. This study included patients aged ≥15 years at cART initiation between 2008 and 2014. The abridged life table method was used to construct life tables stratified by sex and baseline CD4+ T-cell count. Life expectancy was defined as the additional years of life from age at starting cART. Results: 201,688 eligible patients were included in analyses, contributing 618,837 person-years of followup. Median CD4+ T-cell count was 109 cells/mm3 and median age 37 years. The overall life expectancy after cART initiation at age 20 was 25.4 (95% CI, 25.3, 25.6) years and 20.6 (95% CI, 20.5, 20.7) at age 35 years. Life expectancy at baseline CD4+ T-cell count ≥350 cells/mm3 was 51.9 (95% CI, 51.0, 52.9) years for age 20 years and 43.2 (95% CI, 42.4, 44.1) years for age 35 years, close to life expectancy in the general Thai population. Conclusions: Increasing life expectancy with higher baseline CD4+ T-cell counts supports the guideline recommendations to start cART irrespective of CD4+ T-cell count.

According to the findings, 16 criteria factors and eight standard factors influence human resource professionalism. The five criteria factors upon which the human resource experts most strongly agreed were visionary leadership, organizational learning and agility, systems perspective, valuing people, and delivering value and results. The document analysis yielded 13 criterias. However, human resource experts have opined that an additional three criterias, i.e. environmental changes inside and outside the organization, English language capabilities, and human resource workers’ personal characteristics, better identify human resource professionalism quality. The standard factors upon which the human resource experts most strongly agreed were skills and experience in human resource management. Criteria and standards of human resource professionalism also keep the organization connected, easy to understand, manageable, and inspected in addition to convenience and speed. Furthermore, human resource professionalism criteria and standards also help the organization to have high achievements while organizations that neglect human resource professionalism criteria and standards have low achievements. © International Economic Society."
2-s2.0-85032934701,"Objectives A previous publication in Chinese leprosy patients showed that the HLA-B∗13:01 allele is a strong genetic marker for dapsone-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions, however there are no data describing whether HLA-B∗13:01 is a valid marker for prediction of dapsone-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions in other ethnicities or nonleprosy patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is an association between HLA genotypes and dapsone-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Thai nonleprosy patients. Patients and methods HLA-B genotypes of 15 patients with dapsone-induced SCARs (11 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, 4 Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis), 29 control patients, and 986 subjects from the general Thai population were determined by the reverse PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotides probe. Results The HLA-B∗13:01 allele was significantly associated with dapsone-induced SCARs compared with dapsone-tolerant controls (odds ratio: 54.00, 95% confidence interval: 7.96-366.16, P=0.0001) and the general population (odds ratio: 26.11, 95% confidence interval: 7.27-93.75, P=0.0001). In addition, HLA-B∗13:01 associated with dapsone-induced SJS-TEN (OR: 40.50, 95% confidence interval: 2.78-591.01, P=0.0070) and DRESS (OR: 60.75, 95% confidence interval: 7.44-496.18, P=0.0001). Conclusion This study demonstrated an association between HLA-B∗13:01 and dapsone-induced SCARs including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms in nonleprosy patients. Moreover, these results suggest that the HLA-B∗13:01 allele may be a useful genetic marker for prediction of dapsone-induced SCARs in Thai and Han-Chinese populations. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-85033238283,"The analysis of dissolved organic matter is important to characterize drinking water treatment processes. Size-exclusion chromatography is one of the analytical tools used to characterize those compounds. Phosphate eluent is often used for size-exclusion chromatography; however, the eluent may cause the occurrence of molds, which damage expensive columns. Especially after a long-time continuous measurement, the number of theoretical plates decreased. Here, we applied the sulfamate eluent to try to suppress damage to the columns. The chromatogram by the sulfamate eluent showed similar resolution with the phosphate eluent at the initial stage. Moreover, a smaller decrease was observed in the number of theoretical plates even after a long-time continuous measurement. Thus, sulfamate can be used as an alternative and better eluent than the conventional phosphate eluent in the analysis of organic matter in drinking water treatment processes. © 2017 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry."
2-s2.0-85032809228,"Introduction: Overweight and obesity has impacted both the physiological and psychological health of children and adolescents. Evidence of cross-cultural studies has showed mixed results regarding weight reduction program (WRPs) based on self-determination theory (SDT) and social cognitive theory (SCT) affecting students with overweight and obesity. This study examined the effectiveness of a WRP on body mass index (BMI) and autonomous motivation in overweight and obese Thai adolescents. Material and Methods: An experimental study with intervention and control groups was employed. Participants were 304 Thai obese 7th- to 12th-grade students, ranging in age from 12 to 19 years. The intervention group was assigned to a program based on SDT and SCT, consisting of (1) a 12-week weight control phase and (2) a 12-week follow-up phase. The control group was assigned to a general health education program. The data were collected via psychometric questionnaires and anthropometric data. Results: There were no statistical differences in adjusted means of BMI and autonomous motivation of physical activity and dietary intake occurred among participants in the two groups. Compared to those in the control group, participants in the intervention group showed a 0.4 smaller increase in BMI and a 0.4 greater decrease in autonomous motivation of dietary intake. Conclusion: The WRP based on SDT and SCT showed no apparent effectiveness in improving BMI or autonomous motivation among these participants. Future studies should incorporate program that effectively harmonize with core school teaching activities and schedules. © 2017, Nepal Paediatric Society (NEPAS). All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85032907817,"Objectives Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are highly prevalent and put a large burden on (working) society. Primary prevention of work-related MSD focuses often on physical risk factors (such as manual lifting and awkward postures) but has not been too successful in reducing the MSD burden. This may partly be caused by insufficient knowledge of etiological mechanisms and/or a lack of adequately feasible interventions (theory failure and program failure, respectively), possibly due to limited integration of research disciplines. A research framework could link research disciplines thereby strengthening the development and implementation of preventive interventions. Our objective was to define and describe such a framework for multi-disciplinary research on work-related MSD prevention. Methods We described a framework for MSD prevention research, partly based on frameworks from other research fields (ie, sports injury prevention and public health). Results The framework is composed of a repeated sequence of six steps comprising the assessment of (i) incidence and severity of MSD, (ii) risk factors for MSD, and (iii) underlying mechanisms; and the (iv) development, (v) evaluation, and (vi) implementation of preventive intervention(s). Conclusions In the present framework for optimal work-related MSD prevention, research disciplines are linked. This framework can thereby help to improve theories and strengthen the development and implementation of prevention strategies for work-related MSD. © Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health."
2-s2.0-85032972173,"The development of various molecular dynamics methods enables the detailed investigation of association processes, like host-guest complexes, including their dynamics and, additionally, the release of the guest compound. As an example of the application of such methods, the inclusion complexation of cyclodextrins with eucalyptol is described. Eucalyptol is the major constituent of eucalyptus oil, which exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. This compound has many applications including flavors, fragrances and medical therapies. However, its pharmaceutical applications are limited due to volatility and low water solubility. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are compounds that are capable of forming inclusion complexes with eucalyptol to enhance solubility and stability. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were performed to determine the molecular structure, dynamical behaviour and binding affinities of the host-guest inclusion complexes of eucalyptol with native beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) and its derivatives, 2,6-dimethyl-βCD (2,6-DMβCD) and the three hydroxypropyl-βCDs (2-HPβCD, 6-HPβCD and 2,6-DHPβCD). In the inclusion complex, eucalyptol preferentially locates within the hydrophobic cavity with all βCDs studied here. The binding affinities were calculated by MM/PBSA and QM/PBSA with the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) level of theory and are in relatively good agreement with the experimental stability constants in the order of 2,6-DMβCD > βCD > 2-HPβCD. In addition, recently developed metadynamics simulations were applied to investigate the eucalyptol's release pathways from the cavity of the CDs. The results from this study show that MD simulations, metadynamics and related free energy calculations provide an excellent support for experimental studies, and they give additional information about the structural and dynamical behaviour of inclusion complexes as well as the energetic details about host-guest interactions. Moreover, the releasing direction and possible dissociation rates of the inclusion complexes were also predicted. © The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Method: The study was designed as a randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose crossover with 1-week washout period between period I and period II dosing. 20 healthy male and female Thai subjects were enrolled in the study. Each subject was in fasted state for ∼ 10 hours prior to receiving a single oral 150-mg pregabalin capsule. Serial blood samples were collected at pre-dose until 32 hours after drug administration. Plasma samples were extracted by protein precipitation and derivatized with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan. Pregabalin plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. For bioequivalence assessment, the differences of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf means based on ln-transformed data were assessed by the 90% confidence interval (CI). Results: Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined that test and reference products showed 0.96 ± 0.35 and 1.04 ± 0.96 hours for tmax, 4,594.217 ± 834.195 and 4,568.68 ± 573.963 ng/mL for Cmax, 30,048.150 ± 2,998.920 and 29,315.722 ± 2,747.396 ng×h/mL for AUC0-t, 30,594.210 ± 2,872.317 and 29,831.454 ± 2,688.020 ng×h/mL for AUC0-inf, respectively.

2-s2.0-85032906454,"Vehicular communication has recently become an active research issue in both academic and industry. Vehicular Network, by nature, could possess potential problems in connectivity, intelligence, scalability and flexibility.

OpenFlow is the most popular open interface for SDN southbound API. In this paper, we proposed the SDN application over Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET) environment. We believe that the emerging SDN technology and IEEE 802.11p can be used to increase the efficiency and to bridge the gaps in VANET application. We hope to exploit the benefit of SDN by adopting POX/OpenFlow controller to process and perform message routing.

2-s2.0-85032689537,"Purpose: This paper uses the relational capabilities perspective to provide new insights into the mediating role of relational capabilities and their performance implications. Specially, this paper aims to explain how characteristics of a partnership influence relational capabilities that in turn enhance firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from an original survey of 156 partnership projects between buyers and suppliers in the Thai manufacturing sector, the authors use a structural model to test their hypotheses. Findings: The empirical analysis shows that the impact of relational and economic attributes of a partnership on firm performance is mediated by knowledge sharing routines and complementary capability. However, the impact varies between operational and strategic performance, as relational capabilities are strongly associated with operational performance but only indirectly associated with strategic performance. Practical implications: The need to coordinate and mobilize complementary resources not only increases the interdependence between buyers and suppliers but also contributes to firm performance. Specifically, operations can be enhanced by knowledge sharing routines and complementary capability. At a strategic level, operational effectiveness enables firms to benefit from inter-organizational relationships. Originality/value: The authors contribute to industrial marketing knowledge by shedding light on mediation of relational capabilities between inter-organizational attributes and firm performance. The findings demonstrate the value of the relationship between a firm’s supply chain and its relational capabilities which in turn drive project performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

2-s2.0-85032638508,"A full energy chain analysis (FENCH) or a life cycle analysis (LCA) is indeed essential in making any decision on both minimal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the energy content in various commodities. In this article, the energy Input-Output Analysis (IOA) approach is investigated to determine the factors for the total greenhouse gas emission and total energy content, and it deems the elimination of the boundary constraints existing in the Process Chain Analysis (PCA) approach to be practical to. This study, aims to identify the factors in embedded energy and embedded greenhouse gas (GHG) total values derived from the total Thai economic sectors of 180 in various commodities productions. The previous outdated IOA is enhanced in the study by revising the elements of sectoral energy consumption in the power sector, which is later found to be influential and significant to all other economic sectors. In addition, the 2005 sectoral energy consumption is used to show individual energy consumption, whereas the 2010 Input-Output (I-O) table, most timely data, is used to show the economic structure. Furthermore, the study uses a report of Thai electric power to revise the data of 2005 fuel mix in the power sector in order to obtain the 2010 and 2015 fuel mix. The reason of such revision is that the changes of fuel mix in the power sector are influential towards the factors in both total energy content and total greenhouse (GHG) emission. Hence, the 2015 electricity-fuel mix is taken to present the above-mentioned factors."
2-s2.0-85032023550,"Oocyte cryopreservation is the technique of choice for the long-term storage of female gametes. However, it induces an irreversible loss of oocyte viability and function. We examined the effects of vitrification and a Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibitor (ROCKi) on the meiotic and developmental competence of feline oocytes. We examined the expression of LIM kinase (LIMK) 1 and 2, with and without ROCKi treatment. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in vitro with 0, 10, 20, and 40 μM ROCKi. The oocytes were subsequently assessed for maturation rate and embryo development following in vitro fertilization. We repeated the COC experiment, but vitrified and warmed the COCs prior to culture. We detected LIMK1 and LIMK2 expression in feline oocytes, which could be downregulated by ROCKi treatment. The ROCKi at 10 μM affected neither meiotic nor developmental competence (P > 0.05, versus control). However, high concentrations of ROCKi during maturation induced meiotic arrest at metaphase I. Appropriate concentrations of ROCKi significantly improved the normal fertilization rate of vitrified warmed oocytes (49.4 ± 3.4%) compared with that of the control (42.8 ± 8.6%, P < 0.05). The ROCKi also significantly improved the embryo cleavage rate (36.1 ± 3.8%) as compared with the non-treated control (27.4 ± 2.5%, P < 0.05). Thus, this study revealed that the main mediators of the ROCK cascade (LIM kinases) are expressed in feline oocytes.

2-s2.0-85032192407,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children worldwide. To investigate the RSV burden in Thailand over four consecutive years (January 2012 to December 2015), we screened 3,306 samples obtained from children ≤5 years old with acute respiratory tract infection using semi-nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In all, 8.4% (277/3,306) of the specimens tested positive for RSV, most of which appeared in the rainy months of July to November. We then genotyped RSV by sequencing the G glycoprotein gene and performed phylogenetic analysis to determine the RSV antigenic subgroup. The majority (57.4%, 159/277) of the RSV belonged to subgroup A (RSV-A), of which NA1 genotype was the most common in 2012 while ON1 genotype became prevalent the following year. Among samples tested positive for RSV-B subgroup B (RSV-B) (42.6%, 118/277), most were genotype BA9 (92.6%, 87/94) with some BA10 and BA-C. Predicted amino acid sequence from the partial G region showed highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site at residue N237 among all RSV-A ON1 strains (68/68), and at residues N296 (86/87) and N310 (87/87) among RSV-B BA9 strains. Positive selection of key residues combined with notable sequence variations on the G gene contributed to the continued circulation of this rapidly evolving virus. © 2017 Thongpan et al."
2-s2.0-85031099758,"A depressive disorder is a disease characterized by a heterogenous background. The important processes observed and diagnosed in depressed patients indicate that the etiology of depression may include disturbances in thyroid hormone (TH) levels and the occurrence of immune-inflammatory activation. Type 1 (DIO1) and type 3 (DIO3) iodothyronine deiodinases are the enzymes which determine the peripheral and tissue levels of TH, but also interfere with immunological cells and inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate the levels of DIO1 and DIO3 in the patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). Data collected from 91 rDD patients and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. The diagnoses were made based on the ICD-10 criteria (F33.0-F33.8). The expression levels of DIO1 and DIO3 were estimated using the polymerase chain reaction method and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of DIO1 on mRNA/protein levels in the rDD patients was reduced in comparison to the control subjects, while the expression of DIO3 was higher in the patients suffering from depression. No significant relationship was found between the investigated DIOs and other clinical parameters. Our results indicate and suggest a role of DIO1 and DIO3-related pathways in the pathophysiology of depression. The results represent a promising way to investigate the biological markers of depression. © 2017 by Acta Neurobiologiae Exeprimentalis"
2-s2.0-85030840345,Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer. Urine-based HPV testing offers a simple and non-invasive method because of its increasing acceptance. A total of 164 pairs of cervical swab and urine samples from Thai women who underwent cervical cancer screening were used for HPV testing with HPV GenoArray Diagnostic Kits. The overall concordance percentage for HPV detection in the cervical swab and urine samples was 65.2%. The HPV genotypes most commonly detected were HPV16 and HPV18. An analysis of the urine samples and a second analysis of the cervical swab samples showed that the differences in the overall HPV detection rate between women with normal and abnormal cytology were not significant (p > 0:05). Urine samples processed with the GenoArray assay is an alternative for women who decline to undergo Pap smear even though it is not ideal as the first-line screening option. © 2017 Nilyanimit et al.

2-s2.0-85031934024,"The Province of Pathumthani has played an important role in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) in terms of its economics, industry, education, society, and culture in driving the urbanization process. However, the urban areas have been sprawling without control. Some urban areas have expanded to areas with risk of flooding. Especially, in the past 10 years, Pathumthani has suffered from more frequent and more severe floods, which might be affected by climate change. Together with inefficient climate change adaptation plans, the areas with risk of high impacts of flooding have expanded, making the urban settlements in Pathumthani face even higher impacts. The objectives of this research are to examine land use changes in order to understand the direction of urban expansion, to analyze the level of flood impact risk under climate change in Pathumthani by using Sieve Analysis and Geographic Information Systems, and to examine flood adaptation plans and the projections of urban development by using Scenario Analysis. The results show that the flood impact risk of Pathumthani has been higher under climate change, and the areas with flood impact risk have expanded, especially in the western side of Chao Phraya River which covers the majority of the areas in (1) Sam Khok District, (2) Mueang Pathum Thani District, and (3) Lat Lum Kaeo District. Moreover, the results suggest that the direction of urbanization is toward these three districts with high flood impact risk. Thus, climate change adaptation plans are essential for Pathumthani. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa."
2-s2.0-85030781048,"Due to the highly specific binding between an antibody and its target, superior analytical performances was obtained by immunoassays for phytochemical analysis over conventional chromatographic techniques. Here, we describe a simple method for producing a functional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody against ganoderic acid A (GAA), a pharmacologically active metabolite from Ganoderma lingzhi. The Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain produced a large amount of anti-GAA scFv. However, in vitro refolding steps, which partially recovered the reactivity of the scFv, were required. Interestingly, the functional scFv was expressed as a soluble and active form in the cytoplasm of an engineered E. coli SHuffle® strain. Purified anti-GAA scFv, which yielded 2.56mg from 1L of culture medium, was obtained from simple and inexpensive procedures for expression and purification. The anti-GAA scFv-based indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) exhibited high sensitivity (linearity: 0.078–1.25µg/mL) with precision (CV: ≤6.20%) and reliability (recovery: 100.1–101.8%) for GAA determination. In summary, the approach described here is an inexpensive, simple, and efficient expression system that extends the application of anti-GAA scFv-based immunoassays. In addition, when in vitro refolding steps can be skipped, the cost and complexity of scFv antibody production can be minimized. © 2017 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan"
2-s2.0-85030782432,"Background/Aims The correlation between the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) and colonic transit time (CTT) has been reported in Western populations. Our study aims to study the relationship between BSFS, stool frequency, and CTT in Eastern patients with chronic constipation. Methods A total of 144 chronic functional constipation patients underwent colonic transit study by using radio-opaque markers, anorectal manometry, and balloon expulsion test. Stool diary including stool forms and frequency was recorded. Delayed CTT was defined as the retention of more than 20.0% of radio-opaque markers in the colon on day 5. Results Twenty-five patients (17.4%) had delayed colonic transit. Mean 5-day BSFS (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.79; P = 0.021) and stool frequency (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83; P = 0.002) were independently associated with delayed CTT by logistic regression analysis. Mean 5-day BSFS (area under the curve [AUC], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P < 0.001) and stool frequency (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.87; P < 0.001) fairly predicted delayed CTT. The optimal mean 5-day BSFS of ≤ 3 provided 68.0% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity, and 69.4% accuracy, and the optimal stool frequency ≤ 2 bowel movements in 5 days provided 64.0% sensitivity, 83.1% specificity, and 84.0% accuracy for predicting delayed CTT. Conclusions Both stool form and frequency were significantly associated with delayed CTT. Stool frequency ≤ 2 and BSFS 1-3 rather than BSFS 1-2 that was used in the Westerners could be used as surrogate for delayed CTT in Eastern patients with constipation. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility."

The commercial light-activated resin-based sealants, Delton®-clear (DC), Helioseal® clear (HC), Helioseal® opaque (HO), and Clinpro™ Sealant (CL) served as control. Twenty-four 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Two rows of three 5 mm subcutaneous incisions were created on the back of each rat parallel to the midline. The materials were randomly implanted and the incisions were closed using sutures. The implants were left in situ for 7, 30, and 60 days. The implanted samples and the surrounding skin were removed, sectioned, and stained for histopathological evaluation. Results revealed that the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration of the DC, HC, LAS-clear, HO, CL, and LAS-opaque groups were not significantly different at 7, 30, and 60 days post-operation (p > 0.05). The average total inflammatory cell infiltration score was highest at day 7 and lowest at day 30. Even though all the material revealed a persistent inflammatory response mediated by lymphocytes and macrophages at all time point evaluation, the tissue reaction of all groups to material implantation was that of typical wound healing. The tissue response scores of the DC, HC, LAS-clear, HO, CL, and LAS-opaque were not significantly different at 7, 30, and 60 days post-operation. The tissue response observed was material encapsulation without marked pathology. The capsule thickness was gradually increased in a time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the LAS-clear and LAS-opaque materials were biocompatible with the subcutaneous layer."

This study aimed to identify candidate LAB from pig feces and determine their antimicrobial susceptibility following an international standard recommendation. A total of 204 LAB isolates from 60 fecal samples of 30 antibiotic-free healthy fattening indigenous pigs and 30 antibiotic-free healthy fattening commercial pigs were initially screened for viability in acidic and bile conditions. Thirty-four of the isolates as acid- and bile-tolerant LAB were selected for identification and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility. They were characterized and identified by a set of 26 phenotypic tests, whole-cell protein patterns (SDS-PAGE analysis), and 16S rDNA sequesllus agilis (three isolates), L. plantarum (four isolates), Pediococcus acidilactici (one isolate) and P. pentosaceus (six isolates). The identification by 16S rDNA sequence analysis was strongly consistent with the whole-cell protein profiles, but not with the biochemical profiles. LAB presenting multidrug resistance could be found in antibiotic-free pigs. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values showed that among the 34 LAB isolates, only four (P. pentosaceus 77F, and L. plantarum 22F, 25F, 31F) from commercial pigs and one (P. acidilactici 72N) from an indigenous pig were susceptible to all eight antibiotics including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, streptomycin and vancomycin according to EFSA criteria.

2-s2.0-85029859694,"Objective: Foot and ankle exercise has been advocated as a preventative approach in reducing the risk of foot ulceration. However, knowledge about the appropriate types and intensity of exercise program for diabetic foot ulcer prevention is still limited. The current study aimed to examine the effects of an eight-week mini-trampoline exercise on improving foot mobility, plantar pressure and sensation of diabetic neuropathic feet. Methods: Twenty-one people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who had impaired sensation perception were divided into two groups. The exercise group received a foot-care education program plus an eight-week home exercise program using the mini-trampoline (n = 11); whereas a control group received a foot-care education only (n = 10). Measurements were undertaken at the beginning, at the completion of the eight-week program and at a 20- week follow-up. Results: Both groups were similar prior to the study. Subjects in the exercise group significantly increased the range of the first metatarsophalangeal joint in flexion (left: p = 0.040, right: p = 0.012) and extension (left: p = 0.013) of both feet more than controlled subjects. There was a trend for peak plantar pressure at the medial forefoot to decrease in the exercise group (p = 0.016), but not in the control group. At week 20, the number of subjects in the exercise group who improved their vibration perception in their feet notably increased when compared to the control group (left: p = 0.043; right: p = 0.004). Conclusions: This is a preliminary study to document the improvements in foot mobility, plantar pressure and sensation following weight-bearing exercise on a flexible surface in people with diabetic neuropathic feet.

Potent topical steroids such as clobetasol propionate, fluocinolone acetonide (FA), and fluocinonide have been widely used in the treatment of severe oral mucosal lesions. Many reports have demonstrated that these steroids were effective in treating oral lesions with only minor side-effects. This review describes the effectiveness and side-effects of using FA 0.1% in the treatment of symptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP), oral lichenoid drug reaction (OLDR), oral pemphigus, and herpes associated erythema multiforme (HAEM). FA 0.1% was effective and safe in the treatment of patients with multiple systemic diseases and a pregnant patient with HAEM. Moreover, this topical steroid rapidly reduced pain, inflammation, and enhanced lesion healing with no serious side-effects other than pseudomembranous candidiasis, which is easily treated. In some cases, a long-term treatment with FA 0.1% resulted in hyperpigmentation at the areas of previously healed oral lesions; however, this hyperpigmentation was gradually resolved after discontinuing topical steroid treatment."

The results revealed that biodiesel WSF is less soluble than that of diesel WSF. Both of them have lower water solubility with increasing water salinity. After 96 h, diesel WSF caused approximately 50 % mortality in 8 days old larvae (PL8) at all tested temperatures which were significantly higher than that of biodiesel WSF (less than 15 % mortality) and the control (0 - 10 %) (p < 0.05). The mortality (40 % in PL8) decreased when the stage of the larvae increased (less than 20 % in PL13). At 25 °C, the PL13 mortality of both biodiesel and diesel WSF tested larvae was similar and significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.05). However, at 28, 30 and 34 °C the mortality of PL13 became low and was not significantly different with that of the control. For postlarvae (PL22), mortality in all treatments decreased as low as 20 % and was not significantly different among the treatments.

We report hitherto unavailable DNA sequence data from cytochrome oxidase I (COI), internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) and 28S rRNA sequences of two Dugesia species from Southeast Asia: Dugesia batuensis Ball, 1970 from the Batu Caves in Malaysia, and Dugesia deharvengi Kawakatsu & Mitchell, 1989 from Tham Nen Noi in northeastern Thailand. Sequence analyses revealed a novel 25bp duplication in the ITS-1 sequence of D. deharvengi. Phylogenetic analysis of homologous sequences from other Dugesia species found in GenBank showed that D. batuensis does not share a most recent common ancestor with D. deharvengi, but rather with the geographically distant Dugesia ryukyuensis Kawakatsu, 1976.

2-s2.0-85029595565,"Background: Current guidelines suggest that intraperitoneal (IP) antibiotics should be administered only in a long peritoneal dialysis (PD) dwell (≥ 6 hours). The long dwell might result in low ultrafiltration and volume overload. We aim to examine plasma and dialysate concentration of cefazolin and ceftazidime after IP administration in a short-dwell (≤ 2 hours) automated cyclingexchange. Methods: Stable PD patients without peritonitis were invited to participate in the present study. Patients underwent 5 2-liter exchanges of PD fluid over 10 hours by the PD cycling machine without last fill or additional dwell. Cefazolin and ceftazidime (20 mg/kg each) were added to the first 5-liter bag of 2.5% dextrose PD fluid that was placed on the warmer of the PD cycling machine. Plasma samples were collected at 12 time-points over 24 hours. Dialysate samples from each exchange were also collected. Antibiotic concentrations in plasma and dialysate were then determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: Six stable PD patients without peritonitis participated in the study. Dialysate cefazolin and ceftazidime were consistently high throughout the PD session in all patients (26-360mg/L). Plasma cefazolin and ceftazidime exceeded the minimal inhibi­tory concentration (MIC) for susceptible organisms (≤ 8 mg/L) within 2 hours (cefazolin 28.5 ± 8.0 and ceftazidime 12.5 ± 3.4mg/L), peak at 10 hours (51.1 ± 14.1 and 23.0 ± 5.2 mg/L) and sustained well above the MIC at 24 hours (42.0 ± 9.6 and 17.1 ± 3.1 mg/L). Conclusions: The short-dwell cycling IP cefazolin and ceftazi­dime could provide adequate plasma concentration for up to 24hours. Daily short-dwell cycling IP cefazolin and ceftazidime might be used to treat peritonitis in PD patients already using a PD cycling machine as well as selected continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients who need shorter dwells during peritonitis due to increasing peritoneal solute transport. © 2017 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis."
2-s2.0-85029609842,"In this work, TiO2 was decorated with one of four different metals (Bi, Pd, Pt and Au) by sol immobilization at ambient condition. The individual addition of each metals on the TiO2 did not affect the crystallite size or band gap energy of TiO2, but increased its visible light absorption ability due to the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of the doped metals, except for Bi, as well as the mechanism of the charge transfer. Among all the prepared metal-decorated TiO2 photocatalysts, Au/TiO2 exhibited the highest visible light absorption ability and an appropriate mechanism of charge transfer, which consequently alleviated the e−–h+ recombination.

2-s2.0-85029590884,"Background: Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Although a wide range of clinical manifestations from this organism are known, peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) has rarely been reported. Patients and Methods: Peritoneal dialysis patients from all regions in Thailand were eligible for the study if they had peritonitis and either peritoneal fluid or effluent culture positive for B.pseudomallei. Patient data obtained included baseline characteristics, laboratory investigations, treatments, and clinical outcomes. When possible, PD fluid and removed Tenckhoff (TK) catheters were submitted for analyses of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and microbial biofilm, respectively. Results: Twenty-six patients were identified who were positive for peritoneal B. pseudomallei infection. The recorded mean age was 50 ± 15 (24-75) years, and the majority (58%) were female. Most of the cases were farmers living in Northeastern and Northern Thailand. Almost half of the cases had diabetes. Infections were reported commonly during the monsoon season and winter. The clinical presentations of peritonitis were similar to the manifestations from other microorganisms. Nine patients (41%) died (7 from sepsis), 6 fully recovered, and 7 switched to permanent hemodialysis. The mortality was potentially associated with sepsis (p = 0.007), infection during the monsoon season (p = 0.017), high initial dialysate neutrophils (p = 0.045), and high hematocrit (p = 0.045). Although no antibiotic resistance to ceftazidime and carbapenems was detected, approximately 50% of patients died with this treatment. Microbial biofilms were identified on the luminal surface of 4 out of 5 TK catheters, but the removal of the catheter did not alter the outcomes. ♦ Conclusion: Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis due to melioidosis is uncommon but highly fatal.

2-s2.0-85029579165,"A single-stage synthesis of isoprene from methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and formalin in an organic-aqueous two-phase system were studied by using Cs-exchanged silicotungstic acid catalysts (CsXH4-XSiW12O40, abbreviated as CsX-STA). The CsX-STA catalysts (x = 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5) were prepared using Cs2CO3 as Cs source and water as solvent. The catalysts were characterized by using XRF, FTIR, FT-Raman, XRD, N2 sorption, light scattering, TGA, and potentiometric titration techniques to relate catalytic activities to catalyst properties. The characterization results showed that the Keggin structure and cubic unit cell of all Cs-STA catalyst samples were well preserved. The increase in acid strength and total acid sites with decreasing Cs content (x) resulted in increasing formaldehyde conversion and isoprene selectivity. However, at low Cs content (x ≤ 3.0), the high contribution of homogeneous catalysis also played a role in the catalytic activities. The highest activity (isoprene formation normalized with total acid sites) of Cs2.5-STA catalyst was found to be attributed to its high surface area. For the organic solvent effect, the Cs2.5-STA catalyst activity increased with the increasing solvent polarity in the order: n-hexane < cyclohexane < toluene. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85029396895,"The current regulatory guidelines recommend the use of QT interval to assess the risk of arrhythmogenic potential of new chemical entities. Recently, the electromechanical window (EMW), the difference in duration between electrical and mechanical systole, has been proposed as markers for druginduced torsades de pointes (TdP); however, data of EMW in short QT model are not available. This study aimed to characterize the EMW as a marker for drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias in anesthetized rabbit model of long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) and short QT syndrome (SQTS) infused with reference compounds known to lengthen or shorten QT intervals. After rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane, body surface electrocardiograms and left ventricular pressure were recorded. The LQT2 was produced by intravenous infusion with dofetilide (n = 6), quinidine (n = 6) and sotalol (n = 6) whereas the SQTS was induced by intravenous escalating concentrations of nicorandil (n = 7), pinacidil (n = 5) and cromakalim (n = 5). The EMW in anesthetized rabbits ranged from 1.3 to 53.3 msec. All three drugs known to lengthen QT intervals prolonged QT and QTcF interval while the EMW was markedly decreased to negative values. Pinacidil significantly produced QT and QTcF shortening and significantly abbreviated the EMW (p < 0.05). This study demonstrated that the EMW is associated with QT intervals (p < 0.001). It is negative in the presence of QT-prolonging drugs while it is more positive in the presence of QT-shortening drugs.

Here, we investigated the involvement of Notch signaling in the osteogenic differentiation of retinoic acid-treated embryoid bodies derived from mouse gingival fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (mGF-iPSCs). When cultured in osteogenic media, mGF-iPSCs showed an increase in their expression of osteogenic marker genes and deposited a mineralized matrix. Furthermore, increased levels of mRNA for Notch1, Notch2, and Hey1 were observed. In the presence of DAPT, a Notch signaling inhibitor, during osteogenic induction, mRNA levels for osteogenic marker genes were significantly decreased; however, no difference was noted in mineral deposition. Moreover, activation of Notch signaling using Jagged1-immobilized surfaces resulted in a slight increase of in vitro mineralization on days 3 and 7 of osteogenic induction. Significant upregulation of Dlx5, Bsp, and Col I mRNA expression was observed in mGF-iPSCs cultured on Jagged1 surfaces. In conclusion, inhibition and activation of Notch signaling was shown to decrease and increase mGF-iPSC osteogenic differentiation, respectively. However, the responses were not robust, suggesting the involvement of additional signaling pathways. © 2017, Nihon University, School of Dentistry. All rights reserved."

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have been revealed cardioprotective effect in patients with heart diseases. This study aimed to 1) compare the heart rate variability (HRV) between asymptomatic MMVD and healthy dogs and 2) assess long-term effects of sildenafil and enalapril on time- and frequency-domains analyzes. Thirty-four dogs with MMVD stage B1 or B2 and thirteen healthy dogs were recruited into the study. MMVD dogs were divided into 3 subgroups: control (n=13), sildenafil (n=12) and enalapril (n=9). HRV was analyzed from 1-hr Holter recording at baseline (D0) in all dogs and at 30, 90 and 180 days after treatment. The results showed that MMVD dogs had significant higher heart rate (HR), systemic blood pressures, the ratio of low to high frequency (LF/HF) and had significant decreased standard deviation of all normal to normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the percentage of the number of normal-to-normal sinus RR intervals with differences >50 msec computed over the entire recording (pNN50) when compared with healthy dogs (P<0.05). Neither time nor frequency domain parameters were different among subgroups of MMVD dogs at D0. After treatment with sildenafil for 90 days, both time- and frequency-domain parameters were significantly increased when compared with control and enalapril groups. This study demonstrated that sildenafil improves HRV in asymptomatic MMVD dogs suggesting that sildenafil should be used in the MMVD dogs to restore the sympathovagal balance. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science."
2-s2.0-85029188368,"ZnO–AlOOH nanoflakes assembled in flower-like structures were produced through a simple hydrothermal route. The flower-like ZnO–AlOOH composites were used as adsorbents to remove Congo Red (CR) dye from aqueous solution and compared with pure AlOOH and ZnO adsorbents. The adsorption kinetics of the dye on the synthesised samples was described by a pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium adsorption data of CR on the ZnO–AlOOH samples fitted well with the Langmuir model. The ZnO–AlOOH samples possessed excellent adsorption capacity (524 mg/g), which was higher than those of pure AlOOH and ZnO samples. The superior CR removal efficiency of the ZnO-AlOOH samples could be attributed to their hierarchical porous structures and high specific surface areas, which are conducive to the diffusion and adsorption of the CR molecules. © 2017"
2-s2.0-85029319530,"AIM To investigate the possible relationship of adiponectin (ADIPOQ ) gene polymorphisms, plasma adiponectin, and the risk of knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS A total of 398 subjects, 202 knee OA patients and 196 healthy individuals, were enrolled in the case-control study. Genotyping at +45T/G (rs2241766) and +276G/T (rs1501299) loci was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma adiponectin levels were assessed using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. OA severity was determined using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. RESULTS No significant associations were observed in the genotype distributions and allele frequencies at two loci of +45T/G and +276G/T polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ between knee OA patients and control subjects. There was a significant association between genotype distribution of +276G/T polymorphism and KL grade 2, 3 or 4 (P = 0.037, P = 0.046, P = 0.016, respectively). At +45T/G locus, the percentage of GG genotype was notably greater in control subjects (13.40%) compared with OA subjects (1.70%) (P = 0.023). Plasma adiponectin was markedly decreased in OA subjects compared with control subjects (P = 0.03). Likewise, circulating adiponectin in OA subjects was notably lesser than that in control subjects in GG genotype of +45T/G (P = 0.029) and +276G/T polymorphisms (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION Polymorphisms +45T/G and +276G/T of the ADIPOQ gene might not be responsible for OA susceptibility among Thais. © The Author(s) 2017."

2-s2.0-85028745916,"Susceptibility of biofilms with different physical structures to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was studied. Biofilms of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were formed in batch conditions under different carbon sources (glucose, glutamic acid, and citrate), glucose concentrations (5 and 50 mM), and incubation temperatures (25 and 30 °C). The biofilms were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy for their physical characteristics (biomass amount, thickness, biomass volume, surface to volume ratio, and roughness coefficient). The biofilms forming under different growth conditions exhibited different physical structures. The biofilm thickness and the roughness coefficient were found negatively and positively correlated with the biofilm susceptibility to AgNPs, respectively. The effect of AgNPs on biofilms was low (1-log reduction of cell number) when the biofilms had high biomass amount, high thickness, high biomass volume, low surface to volume ratio, and low roughness coefficient. Furthermore, the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) stripping process was applied to confirm the dependence of susceptibility to AgNPs on the structure of biofilm. After the EPS stripping process, the biofilms forming under different conditions showed reduction in thickness and biomass volume, and increases in surface to volume ratio and roughness coefficient, which led to more biofilm susceptibility to AgNPs. The results of this study suggest that controlling the growth conditions to alter the biofilm physical structure is a possible approach to reduce the impact of AgNPs on biofilms in engineered and natural systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The arduino-driven platform was based on a fast and stiff linear Delta robot with a close-loop control and incorporated FDM technology. The print head navigated with a camera with real-time feature extraction algorithm to determine the position and orientation of the printed feature with respect to the geometry of the primitive object. Minimal or no fixture for the primitive object was required, depending on the bed-primitive interface friction. With the naturally 3D motion of Delta robots, features could be constructed layer by layer on top of the leveled or inclined plastic-base commercial products at the same cost.

2-s2.0-85028957536,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate key critical factors for developing transit trade corridors (TTCs) in optimizing trade and logistics performance, taking into account economic, geographic and political concerns among countries in the Northeast Asia region, which have been dynamically developing TTCs to optimize trade and logistics performance in association with development of transport infrastructure in the Greater Tumen Region located in the Northeast Asia. Design/methodology/approach: This research explores key factors affecting the TTC through a comprehensive literature review in tandem with expert survey. Factor analysis, both exploratory and confirmatory, is employed to further investigate the underlying factors affecting more efficient development of a TTC. Findings: This research has drawn eight underlying factors affecting the design of a TTC: development and policy implications; safety, security and political concerns; environmental protection; financing and investment; soft infrastructure; hard infrastructure; geography and landscape; and corridor performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper has a limited geographical scope of the Northeast Asia. Therefore, more primary data collection would be useful in future work. Development of International trade corridor and TTC is critical in northeast Asia for moving goods through designated geographical paths. The key factors drawn in this paper contributes not only to promoting its related services and information (across borders) with the provision of policy support and related facilities for TTC but also to lowering logistics costs and improving trades in the northeast Asian region. As a result, the countries in the region will accelerate their regional economies in collaboration with international bodies and framework, such as UNDP, Greater Tumen Initiative and One Belt One Road Initiative. Practical implications: The eight underlying factors the authors identified in this research will be valuable for policy-makers to design TTCs and consequently the research will contribute to regional economies in northeast Asia by establishing efficient trade and transport routes among the countries in the region. Social implications: Developing TTCs is a kind of platform and infrastructure to accelerate cargo movements and people movements in the northeast Asia. Users of TTCs will benefit their businesses thanks to an efficient logistics system and lower logistics costs, which result in promoting international and regional trade in the region. Originality/value: There has not been any research done on factors to consider in developing TTCs in the world, whose consequence is no readily available reference that can support a systematic assessment and decision-making in development of TTCs. The findings of this research provide a helpful reference for policy-makers, potential users and developers of TTCs to refer in planning and developing them. © 2017, © Korea Trade and Research Association."
2-s2.0-85028639850,"The study is aimed to investigate the combination of nanocrystalline γ- and χ- alumina that displays the attractive chemical and physical properties for the catalytic dehydration of ethanol. The correlation between the acid density and ethanol conversion was observed. The high acid density apparently results in high catalytic activity, especially for the equally mixed γ- and χ- phase alumina (G50C50). In order to obtain a better understanding on how different catalysts would affect the ethylene yield, one of the most powerful techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. Hence, the different O 1s surface atoms can be identified and divided into three types including lattice oxygen (O, 530.7 eV), surface hydroxyl (OH, 532.1 eV) and lattice water (H2O, 532.9 eV). It was remarkably found that the large amount of O 1s surface atoms in lattice water can result in increased ethylene yield. In summary, the appearance of metastable χ-alumina structure exhibited better catalytic activity and ethylene yield than γ-alumina. Thus, the introduction of metastable χ- alumina structure into γ- alumina enhanced catalytic activity and ethylene yield. As the result, it was found that the G50C50 catalyst exhibits the ethylene yield (80%) at the lowest reaction temperature ca. 250℃ among other catalysts. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society."

The characterization and enumeration of constacyclic Hermitian self-dual (resp., complementary dual) codes of length n over Fq2 are given through their Hermitian hulls. Subsequently, a new family of MDS constacyclic Hermitian self-dual codes over Fq2 is introduced. As a generalization of constacyclic codes, quasi-twisted Hermitian self-dual codes are studied. Using the factorization of xn − λ and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, quasi-twisted codes can be viewed as a product of linear codes of shorter length over some extension fields of Fq2. Necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi-twisted codes to be Hermitian self-dual are given. The enumeration of such self-dual codes is determined as well. © 2017 AIMS."

The aim of this study is to compare the assessment of periodontal conditions and infrabony defects between conventional intraoral radiography (IOR) and CBCT. Methods: The study included 25 subjects who had periodontitis and at least two infrabony defects. All subjects received clinical periodontal examination, IOR and CBCT. Three periodontists assigned periodontal diagnosis and prognosis of each tooth. For teeth with infrabony defects, the number of defect walls and treatment was determined. IOR and CBCT assessment was compared.Results: There were 666 teeth and 123 infrabony defects. The overall concordance between IOR and CBCT for periodontal diagnosis, prognosis, infrabony defect type and infrabony defect treatment were 79.3%, 69.5%, 44.7% and 64.2%, respectively. IOR underestimated diagnosis, prognosis and the number of infrabony defect walls at 16.4%, 24% and 37.4%, respectively. IOR and CBCT had poor concordance for periodontal regeneration (43.3%).Tooth extraction was more prevalent when assessed by CBCT (35.0% vs 22.7%). CBCT had excellent interexaminer agreement (Fleiss' kappa 0.87-0.94) and higher percentage of complete agreement among examiners than IOR for all assessments.Conclusions: IOR underestimated the severity and prognosis of periodontal disease. CBCT was superior to IOR for evaluation of infrabony defect morphology and treatment.

2-s2.0-85028300656,"Background Ecdysteroids, a group of steroid hormones found in insects and many plants, have been shown to prevent various changes in mammalian tissues after female sex hormone deprivation. Purpose To examine whether an ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE), exhibits regulatory or protective roles in the cardiovascular system. Study design/method Blood pressure and cardiac function were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) during and after daily treatment with 20-HE for six weeks. Results The progressive increase in systolic blood pressure with age in SHR rats was significantly lower in animals treated with either 5 or 10 mg/kg body weight of 20-HE. However, treatment with 20-HE did not diminish the increase in diastolic pressure. Echocardiography after six weeks of treatment demonstrated that the left ventricular chamber of SHR rats treated with 20-HE was smaller than that of SHR controls, while contractility was not affected by 20-HE. Histological images also demonstrated a decrease in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area in 20-HE treated groups. Interestingly, treatment with 20-HE caused a shift in cardiac myosin heavy chain towards more β-isoforms. SHR rats treated with 20-HE also exhibited a decrease in seminal vesicular weight and an increase in testicular weight, especially at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. This finding suggests a possible anti-androgenic effect of 20-HE. Conclusion Our finding reveal that 20-HE has a beneficial effect on reducing blood pressure and consequently preventing dilated cardiac hypertrophy in SHR rats. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85028244351,"In the present work, a catalytic coated-wall microreactor was developed and tested for producing epoxidized methyl oleate in a solvent-free system. TiO2was coated inside the microcapillary reactor wall by a static method, while H2O2and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were used as oxidant and stabilizer, respectively. The weight percent of oxirane oxygen was determined according to ASTM D1652 and the reaction performance was evaluated as oxirane oxygen yield and selectivity. Without TiO2coated catalyst or formic acid, trace oxirane yield were obtained. Without EDTA as stabilizer, decomposition of H2O2occurred as bubbles formation causing system operation failure. The results indicated that TiO2coated catalyst as well as the presences of EDTA and formic acid were crucial for epoxidation reaction, and oxirane yield of 43.1% could be achieved at the optimal reaction temperature of 60 °C and residence time of 2.7 min. The results were compared with the data obtained from a batch reactor. Microcapillary reactor offers continuous operation with 23 times higher reaction rate of epoxide production than batch reactor.

2-s2.0-85027948963,"Sorption enhanced steam reforming of biogas is a promising process for H2production by which biogas steam reforming is combined with simultaneous CO2capture in a single unit operation. In the first part, Zr4+, Ce4+and La3+were doped on CaO and tested the performance for 10 CO2sorption/desorption cycles. Zr-CaO and Ce-CaO offered a stable CO2capture activity for at least 10 cycles (CO2sorption capacity of 0.30 and 0.22 gCO/gsorbentat the 1st cycle, and 0.29 and 0.23 gCO/gsorbentat the 10th cycle for Zr-CaO and Ce-CaO, respectively). On the other hand, La-CaO indicated decreasing of CO2sorption capacity about 16% over 10 cycle operations. This is due to the Zr-CaO and Ce-CaO presented oxygen storage at low temperature which is characterized by temperature program reduction oxidation (TPRO). This behavior promotes the CO2diffusion from the surface to the bulk (sorption) and the bulk to the surface (desorption) of the modified CaO. In the second part, Ni2+was loaded on the modified sorbents for H2production. Ni-Zr-CaO and Ni-Ce-CaO can enable the production of H2with purities of approximately 90% and 85%, respectively, with repeating cycles; however, the CH4conversions decreased significantly over five cycles (the post-breakthrough period CH4conversion of Ni-Zr-CaO and Ni-Ce-CaO decreased from 65.6 and 56.3% during the 1st cycle to 33.0 and 28.9% during the 5th cycle). This is because the Ni active sites at the surface of multifunctional catalysts were lost (as confirmed by XPS results) by pore closure (as shown in SEM images) which was possibly due to the CaCO3formation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Utilizing the Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS) as research tool, the results were used to analyze and create a Thai food value model. The authors developed Thai food value model (Model A), which consisted of 12 factors. However, the results had shown that Model A with 12 variables were not compatible with the empirical research; therefore, Model A was further developed into Model B, which consisted of seven variables, namely taste, nutrition, storytelling, marketing, assurance, Thai food value and behaviors intentions. After the second analysis of the model, it shows that the IOCis Chi-square = 3.030, D.F. = 3 and P-Value = .387. Concluded from the study is that the strongest variables in the order of influence on Thai Food value are nutrition, assurance, storytelling and taste. Marketing is the least important. Variables in the order of direct effect on Behavioral Intentions are taste, nutrition and Thai Food value.

2-s2.0-85027580908,"Background and Objective: This study investigates the effects of off-road activities associated with nature-based tourism, an important head watershed of 16 km2 in Khao Krajome, Thailand. This location is only accessible by off-road vehicles. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the use of off-road vehicles on the environment, in particular, by evaluating noise level, the number of animals, the number of vegetation and soil compaction. Materials and Methods: Data were collected in high and low tourist season. Wildlife number assessment was determined by the strip-transect method. Sixteen collection points were used to measure the impact of off-road vehicle use on vegetation and soil. Classification of the sampling sites was based on their distance from the road. To measure environmental impact, the first 8 collection points were located close to the road, while the remaining 8 collection points were located 14 m away from the road. Mann-Whitney U-Test was used to determine the data. Results: Mean noise levels were determined to be 24.3 dB(A) during the high season and 12.1 dB(A) during the low season. The noise levels were 2.5 times greater than regulations allow (10 dB(A)). This was also reflected in the number of animals, as fewer animals were found in close proximity to the road. The findings from Mann-Whitney U-Test revealed that the increased soil compaction along the road was significant (""<0.05) when compared to locations away from the road. While the number of plant species was not statistically different between collection points. Conclusion: It was concluded that these off-road activities caused negative impacts on the environment, in particular wildlife. It is anticipated that these findings will assist in the regulation of nature-based tourism in comprehensively managing this location for environmental and tourism sustainably. © 2017 Patthawan Lerdsuchatavanich et al."

The current study emphasized on the use of integrated bioaugmentation and biostimulation techniques to enhance profenofos bioremediation. A profenofos-degrading consortium including Pseudomonas strains was chosen as a bioaugmented culture. For stimulated condition adjustment, sodium succinate as an additional organic carbon supplement (4-500 mg-carbon/L) was applied in batch experiment. Column experiment was carried out for investigating profenofos remediation with different infiltration rates and cell numbers of 25 to 100 cm/d and 105 and 1015 CFU/mL, respectively. The batch result showed that the experiment with sodium succinate supplement efficiently degraded profenofos of more than 80%. At profenofos concentrations of 20 to 120 mg/L, the profenofos degradation ranged from 85 to 91%. For the column experiment, profenofos removal was between 30 to more than 90%. The infiltration rates and microbial numbers significantly affected the profenofos degradation. Lower infiltration rates or higher cell number resulted in higher profenofos removal performance.

However, the taxonomy of the GenusCassia is quite complex and intriguing. Thus, the correct identification of the species of this genus is necessary for efficacy and safety. The phylogenetic relationships among the 16 species of Cassiagenus existing in Thailand were evaluated using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique. Combinations of 70 primers were screened and eleven primer combinations produced a total of 849 distinct and reproducible bands ranging from 60 to 100 bands with an average of 77.18 bands per primer combination. The genetic distances were calculated based on the AFLP bands that had been amplified using the eleven primer combinations. The similarity indices (SI) ranged from 0.25 to 0.78. The dendrogram was created using the Unweighted Pair Group Method of the Arithmetic Average (UPGMA) and the genotypes were divided into two major groups. The results indicate that the phylogenetic relationships are associated with the morphological characterization.

2-s2.0-85027383687,"Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse habitats on Earth, but knowledge of their associated marinemicrobiome remains limited. To increase the understanding of the coral reef ecosystem in the lower Gulf of Thailand, this study utilized 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to identify the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiota present in the reef water at Kham Island, Trat province, Thailand (N6.97 E100.86). The obtained result was then compared with the published microbiota from different coral reef water and marine sites. The coral reefs at Kham Island are of the fringe type. The reefs remain preserved and abundant. The community similarity indices (i.e., Lennon similarity index, Yue & Clayton similarity index) indicated that the prokaryotic composition of Kham was closely related to that of Kra, another fringing reef site in the lower Gulf of Thailand, followed by coral reef water microbiota at GS048b (Cooks Bay, Fr. Polynesia), Palmyra (Northern Line Islands, United States) and GS108b (Coccos Keeling, Australia), respectively. Additionally, the microbial eukaryotic populations at Kham was analyzed and compared with the available database at Kra. Both eukaryotic microbiota, in summer and winter seasons, were correlated. An abundance of Dinophysis acuminata was noted in the summer season, in accordance with its reported cause of diarrhoeatic shellfish outbreak in the summer season elsewhere. The slightly lower biodiversity in Kham than at Kra might reflect the partly habitat difference due to coastal anthropogenic activities and minor water circulation, as Kham locates close to the mainland and is surrounded by islands (e.g., Chang and Kut islands). The global marine microbiota comparison suggested relatively similar microbial structures among coral sites irrespective of geographical location, supporting the importance of coral-associated marine microbiomes, and Spearman's correlation analysis between community membership and factors of shore distance and seawater temperature indicated potential correlation of these factors (p-values < 0.05) with Kham, Kra, and some other coral and coastal sites. Together, this study provided the second marine microbial database for the coral reef of the lower Gulf of Thailand, and a comparison of the coral-associated marine microbial diversity among global ocean sites. © 2017 Somboonna et al."

2-s2.0-85026905570,"Defective TiO2 or black TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are remarkably attractive for photocatalytic applications, since the defect-disordered structure crucially affects the optical properties. In this work, high visible light-active black TiO2 NPs were synthesized by an innovative solution plasma process (SPP) with a titanium (Ti) electrode in HNO3 solution. The effects of the plasma operating parameters, in terms of the pulse frequency (20–80 kHz) and pulse width (0.5–2.0 μs) under two different HNO3 concentrations (0.3 mM and 3.0 mM) on the morphology, structural and optical properties of the obtained black TiO2 NPs were explored. Increasing the pulse frequency, pulse width and concentration of HNO3 all increased the input energy per pulse and energy per second, which induced an increased volume-based particle size, synthesis rate and Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio, but decreased the rutile mass fraction, the Ti-OH/TiO ratio and the band gap energy of the obtained black TiO2 NPs. Among all the prepared black TiO2 NP samples, those prepared at a pulse frequency of 20 kHz, pulse width of 2 μs (energy input per second of 17.3 J) in 3.0 mM HNO3 exhibited the highest visible-light absorption capability (the lowest band gap energy of ∼2.44 eV). The variation in the band gap energy was more strongly dependent on the Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio than the Ti-OH/TiO ratio in the structure of black TiO2 NPs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85026889629,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular arrhythmia that leads to a decrease in cardiac output and impairs cardiac function and quality of life. Dronedarone has an atrial-selective property and has been used for management of AF in humans, but limited information is available in dogs. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy of dronedarone in attenuating the duration of AF in dog model of sustained AF. Six beagle dogs were anesthetized with isoflurane and instrumented to measure atrial action potential duration (aAPD) and atrial effective refractory period (AERP). Then AF was induced by rapid right atrial pacing (20 V, 40 Hz) simultaneously with infusion of phenylephrine (2 µg/kg/min, intravenously) for 20 min. The duration of sustained AF was recorded, and the animals were allowed to recover. Dronedarone was given at a dose of 20 mg/kg, BID, orally for 7 days. On the last day, the dogs were anesthetized again to record aAPD and AERP, and AF was induced with the same procedure as described above. The results showed that after dronedarone administration the aAPD was lengthened significantly from 76.4 ± 4.2 ms to 91.2 ± 3.9 ms (P<0.05) and AERP was prolonged significantly from 97.5 ± 2.8 ms to 120 ± 4.8 ms (P<0.05). The duration of sustained AF was also significantly attenuated after receipt of dronedarone (P<0.05). It can be suggested that oral dronedarone attenuates the duration of sustained AF in a dog model of AF by extending the AERP more than the aAPD, causing post-repolarization refractoriness. Hence, dronedarone may be useful for management of AF in dogs. © 2017 Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science."
2-s2.0-85027562107,"Thermochromic polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are known for their conjugated bonds with reversibility when the molecules are maintained with the bond distance of the polymer backbone along with the stacking angle. With this structural requirement, the fabrication of PDAs has to rely on thin films or coatings on the substrates where the alignment and packing of the molecules can be controlled at the molecular level. The present work demonstrates for the first time, a free-standing thermochromic film based on the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) film as a model case. Here, the PDA with a star structure is considered as the approach to provide the symmetrical chains for PDA so that the PDA molecules aligned under the chain distance are controlled by the steric branches. By simply constructing an eight-armed benzoxazine dimer from the tetra-branched benzoxazine core followed by lactide ring opening polymerization as well as the conjugation with diacetylenes at each terminal, a precise eight-branched diacetylene, i.e.4BzD-8PPLA-8DA, can be easily obtained. The blend of this compound with PLA resin followed by solution casting leads to a free-standing film with reversible thermochromic properties. The comparative studies on PLA films containing other types of branching PLLA terminated with PDA clarifies to us that these films do not show reversible thermochromism at all. The microstructure analyses indicate that the symmetrical eight-armed 4BzD-8PPLA core plays an important role to provide the framework for maintaining the ene-yne conjugated bond under a certain mobility 4BzD-8PPLA-8PDA/PLA upon heating and cooling to result in the reversible thermochromic behavior. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2-s2.0-85026778125,"Maternal smoking during pregnancy contributes to long-term health problems in offspring, especially respiratory disorders that can manifest in either childhood or adulthood. Receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) are multiligand receptors abundantly localized in the lung, capable of responding to by-products of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory responses. RAGE signaling is a key regulator of inflammation in cigarette smoking-related pulmonary diseases. However, the impact of maternal cigarette smoke exposure on lung RAGE signaling in the offspring is unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE), as well as mitochondria-targeted antioxidant [mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ)] treatment, during pregnancy on the RAGE-mediated signaling pathway in the lung of male offspring. Female Balb/c mice (8 wk) were divided into a sham group (exposed to air), an SE group (exposed to cigarette smoke), and an SE + MQ group (exposed to cigarette smoke with MitoQ supplement from mating). The lungs from male offspring were collected at 13 wk. RAGE and its downstream signaling, including nuclear factor-γB and mitogen-activated protein kinase family consisting of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, ERK2, c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphorylated JNK, in the lung were significantly increased in the SE offspring. Mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase was reduced, whereas IL-1β and oxidative stress response nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 were significantly increased in the SE offspring. Maternal MitoQ treatment normalized RAGE, IL-1β, and Nrf-2 levels in the SE + MQ offspring. Maternal SE increased RAGE and its signaling elements associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in offspring lungs, whereas maternal MitoQ treatment can partially normalize these changes. © 2017 the American Physiological Society."
2-s2.0-85026667170,"Background: Psoriasis is the disease of abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis. Alterations in DNA methylation leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation is one of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis. B-cell receptor associated protein (BCAP31) has been reported to be involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of keratinocytes. Up-regulation and changing in BCAP31 promoter methylation has been reported to be associated with some cancers. To date, there has been no study of psoriasis. Objective: We investigated BCAP31 protein expression and the status of BCAP31 promoter methylation in psoriasis. Method: Ten patients with psoriasis and 10 healthy subjects were enrolled. The immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue section to detect BCAP31 protein expression and compared between psoriasis and normal skin. The laser capture micro-dissected keratinocyte were analyzed using bisulfite PCR method and cloning and sequencing. Results: Increased BCAP31 protein expression was observed in psoriatic epidermis compared with normal epidermis. Interestingly the methylation level of the BCAP31 promoter was significantly lower in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy subjects (p < 0.001, % psoriasis vs. normal skin methylation = 14.94 vs. 60.61). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated increase expression of BCAP31 protein related to BCAP31 DNA demethylation in psoriasis. Future study is needed to indicate the mechanism of BCAP31 promoter demethylation and its potential use as a novel treatment for psoriasis in the future. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

2-s2.0-85027227411,"Various olefins including 1- and 2-butene, 2-pentene, and ethylene were used as the reactants for producing propylene by self- and cross-metathesis reactions at 60 °C on supported Re-based catalysts (4 wt% Re). A similar surface structure of rhenium oxides in the form of isolated ReO4 species was observed on Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 supported rhenium oxide catalysts. The catalysts, however, differed in terms of the types (Lewis/Bronsted) and strengths of the acidic sites, as revealed by ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) of NH3 adsorption and thermodesorption results. Weak Lewis acidity, especially high ratios of Lewis acid bands at 1280 cm-1/1622 cm-1, led to high metathesis activity of the Re-based catalysts. The additional isomerization activity, however, required strong Bronsted acid sites. The product distribution from the various feeds depended largely on the size of the olefins, and not only on the acid properties of the catalysts. Re2O7/SiO2-Al2O3 appeared to be a versatile catalyst for obtaining a high yield of propylene using either a single reactant (1- or 2-butene) or an ethylene mixed feed. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2-s2.0-85026662925,"Periauricular paresthesia may afflict patients for a significant amount of time after facelift surgery. When performing face and neck lift surgery, temple and posterior auricular flap dissection is undertaken directly over the auriculotemporal, great auricular, and lesser occipital nerve territory, leading to potential damage to the nerve. The auriculotemporal nerve remains under the thin outer superficial fascia just below the subfollicular level in the prehelical area. To prevent damage to the auriculotemporal nerve and to protect the temporal hair follicle, the dissection plane should be kept just above the thin fascia covering the auriculotemporal nerve. Around the McKinney point, the adipose tissue covering the deep fascia is apt to be elevated from the deep fascia due to its denser fascial relationship with the skin, which leaves the great auricular nerve open to exposure. In order to prevent damage to the posterior branches of the great auricular nerve, the skin flap at the posterior auricular sulcus should be elevated above the auricularis posterior muscle. Fixating the superficial muscular aponeurotic system flap deeper and higher to the tympano-parotid fascia is recommended in order to avoid compromising the lobular branch of the great auricular nerve. The lesser occipital nerve (C2, C3) travels superficially at a proximal and variable level that makes it vulnerable to compromise in the mastoid dissection. Leaving the adipose tissue at the level of the deep fascia puts the branches of the great auricular nerve and lesser occipital nerve at less risk, and has been confirmed not to compromise either tissue perfusion or hair follicles. © 2017 The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons"
2-s2.0-85026648848,"Background: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have an increased risk of celiac disease (CD). Both diseases have a common genetic susceptibility locus in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles. Testing for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) is highly accurate for a CD diagnosis. Objective: To determine the frequency of HLA-DQB1*0201/02 and DQB1*0302 alleles and anti-tTG seropositivity in children with T1DM. Method: Forty-six children with T1DM (male:female=24:22; mean age 12±3.7 years) without significant digestive symptoms were enrolled. The mean duration of diabetes was 5±3.5 years. Serum anti-tTG IgA and IgG as well as HLA-DQ2 (DQB1*0201/02) and -DQ8 (DQB1*0302) alleles were analyzed. The allele frequencies were compared with those in controls, which included 124 normal Thai individuals, as reported in our previous study. Results: All subjects were negative for anti-tTG IgG. Only one patient (2.2%) was positive for anti-tTG IgA (38.5 U/mL; cut-off 15 U/mL). Although this patient was also heterozygous for HLA-DQ2 and was asymptomatic for CD, he declined endoscopic confirmation. Twenty-nine of 46 patients carried HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 heterodimers. HLA-DQB1*0201/02 and HLA-DQB1*0302 allele frequencies were significantly higher (27% and 14%) in T1DM patients compared with normal controls (13.3% and 7.3%; P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively). Conclusions: A significantly greater frequency of DQB1*0201/02 and DQB1*0302 alleles were present in children with T1DM compared with the control group. This indicates a potentially important role of these alleles in the development of T1DM. The prevalence of CD screening by serologic testing is negligible in Thai children with T1DM. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85026749639,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating effect of organizational embeddedness in the relationship between quality of work life (QWL) and turnover under a foundation of conservation of resources theory. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 422 healthcare professionals through a questionnaire survey, and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that organizational embeddedness has a negative impact on employees’ intention to leave, and on actual turnover. For QWL perception, career opportunities, work life balance, and job characteristics are positive and significant predictors of organizational embeddedness. In addition, organizational embeddedness plays an intermediary role that mediates the relationship between the three components of QWL mentioned earlier and turnover intention, and also between the factor of career opportunities and actual turnover. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place within two healthcare organizations. Replicating the study in a variety of business sectors or professions with a larger sample of subjects would be useful for the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Organizations may improve their retention of employees by offering intrinsic resources that can be obtained from the social contexts of the individual through human resource management system, e.g., growth opportunities, a healthy and caring work life quality. Such motivational resources then develop a sense of obligation toward their places of employment, which influences their intention to stay or leave.

However, there is increasing concern about side effects of using normal saline. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of balanced salt solution vs 0.9% normal saline solution (NSS) on decreasing morbidity and mortality in pediatric septic shock. This was a prospective observational study enrolled septic children aged 1-15 years treated at the Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. They were given fluids resuscitation according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines. Thirty-five sepsis children were enrolled, 20 received normal saline as first line fluid resuscitation and 15 received balanced . salt solution (Ringer lactate solution [RLS]) as first line fluid resuscitation. Baseline characteristic of both groups were similar. RLS group received significantly less fluid resuscitation at 24 and 48 hours compared to NSS group (134.3±42.9 vs 171.3±49.5; p=0.02, 236.9±75.7 vs 313.1±115.3; p=0.03). Moreover, RLS group had significantly less metabolic acidosis and better base excess at 6 hours and 24 hours compared to NSS group (2.5±4.1 vs -3.7±4.1; p<0.001, 3.4±3.2 vs -1.2±3.9; p=0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between two groups (15% [n=3] NSS, 6.7% [n=1] RLS).

The ability to recognise and make a quick diagnosis of secretory type of diarrhoea dictated the outcome of patients with this ailment. Catecholamine hypersecretion was considered with the additional clues of refractory tachycardia and hypertension, a well-recognised phenomenon of neuroblastic tumours. A neuroblastic tumour can lead to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) overexpression, which may result in secretory diarrhoea. In this situation, measurements of plasma VIP enabled crucial diagnosis.

Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using a flowsheet simulator (Aspen plus). The exergy analysis is performed to evaluate the energy utilization efficiency of each unit and that of the integrated process. The effect of steam and nickel oxide to biogas ratios on the exergetic performance of the stand-alone biogas sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming process is investigated. The total exergy destruction increases as the steam or nickel oxide to biogas ratio increases. The main exergy destruction is found at the air reactor. For the high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the main exergy destruction is found at the cathode. The total exergy destruction increases when cell temperature increases, whereas the inverse effect is found when the current density is considered as a key parameter. Regarding the exergy efficiency, the results show opposite trend to the exergy destruction. The heat integration analysis is performed to improve the exergetic performance. It is found that the integrated process including the heat integration system can improve the exergy destruction and exergy efficiency of 48% and 60%, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in preventing donor site seroma formation after the harvest of an LD flap for breast reconstruction. Methods In this prospective matched-pair study, 40 patients in whom an LD flap was harvested for breast reconstruction were enrolled. NPWT was used in 20 patients, and in a control group composed of another 20 patients, the conventional donor site dressing technique was used. Information was collected regarding postoperative complications, the incidence of seroma, total drainage volume, the number of percutaneous seroma aspirations, and the volume aspirated. Results In the NPWT group, the incidence of seroma formation after drain removal was significantly lower than in the control group (15% vs. 70%; odds ratio=0.07; relative risk, 0.24). Both the mean percutaneous aspirated volume (P=0.004) and the number of percutaneous aspirations (P= 0.001) were also significantly lower in the NPWT group. There were no significant differences in the total drainage volume or the duration of wound drainage between the NPWT dressing group and the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusions This study showed that NPWT is a promising tool for reducing the incidence of seroma formation after removing the drain at the donor site after LD flap harvesting.

The simulations show that the neral/ CD inclusion complex could be formed in an aqueous solution with a 1:1 ratio. Three possible binding orientations were assessed for the encapsulation of neral (1neral,7neral, anduneral) inside the hydrophobic interior of the host molecule. Theuneral, in which both aldehyde and alkyl terminals point outward on the secondary rim of the CD, was observed to be the most preferential conformation in all neral/CD complexes. The theoretical calculations of the binding ability of the host-guest inclusion complexes agreed well with the experimental data, thereby supporting that the neral could bind inside the hydrophobic cavity of all CDs with nearly the same potency. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2-s2.0-85026631789,"Purpose: Developing countries in many parts of the world have experienced a disturbing trend in the differential pace of economic development among urban and rural communities. These inequities have been observed in education systems in Asia, Africa, and Latin America where researchers have documented differences not only in resource allocation but also in the academic performance among students in urban and rural schools. Recently researchers have shifted their focus from examining financial and physical resources to investigating the nature and impact of differences in human resources. The purpose of this paper is to examine differences in school organization processes associated with learning-centered leadership and teacher learning among urban and rural primary schools in Thailand. Teacher trust and teacher agency were proposed as possible mediators of leadership effects on teacher learning. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a cross-sectional survey design. The authors collected survey data from 1,011 teachers and 60 principals in 30 urban and 30 rural primary schools in Thailand. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and bootstrapping were used to analyze the proposed model of leadership and teacher professional learning. More specifically, data analysis was aimed at determining the nature of relationships among the constructs in the conceptual model and whether patterns of leadership and teacher learning differed in urban and rural primary schools. Findings: The results affirmed a model whereby school leadership exerted significant indirect effects on teacher learning in both urban and rural primary schools. Data analyses determined that the path of leadership effects moved through trust to agency and then to teacher professional learning. Thus, while the authors found a strong direct effect of leadership on teacher trust, there were only small direct effects of leadership on teacher agency and no meaningful direct effects of leadership on teacher professional learning. Thus, the research affirmed a full mediation model of leadership effects on teacher learning. Finally, the study also affirmed that the measured variables were perceived as significantly stronger in the urban schools than in the rural schools. Social implications: The research expands on prior research on the “achievement gap” in Thailand by demonstrating the existence of a similar “human resource gap” when comparing urban and rural school leaders and teachers. This study implies that addressing the gap in student achievement will require action aimed at building the capacity of the principals and teachers who work with the rural pupils. Originality/value: These results suggest differences in the quality of human resources between urban and rural primary schools in Thailand. There may be potential benefit to be gained from providing training focused on “learning-centered leadership” for principals and middle level leaders, as well as expanding access to quality professional development opportunities for rural teachers. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

This primary screening study focused on blood glucose levels and hematological values in diabetic rats treated with the leaf extract from C. longisepalum (CL). Results showed that the CL extract can lower the blood glucose level of the experimental animals from the diabetic state. In relation to this, the extract caused the hematological value in diabetic rats to drop close to normal controls. However, the in vitro α-glucosidase assay-guided isolation revealed that the stem extract of C. longisepalum has a possible connection with the inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidase. Three triterpenoids (1-3), one glycerol derivative (4) as well as six phenylpropanoid glycosides (5-10) were isolated. Compound 10 possessed good anti-α-glucosidase activity (maltase).

Specimens were divided into five developmental stages: preflexion larvae, flexion larvae, postflexion larvae, transforming larvae, and juvenile by study of morphometric character, meristic character and pigmentation pattern. The length at juvenile was defined by using a multivariate analysis of morphometric characters. The length at juvenile stage of T. jarbua and P. quadrilineatus began at 23.16 mm and 18.24 mm in standard length, respectively. All morphometric characters were significantly different (P<0.05) between transforming larvae and juvenile stage in both species. An understanding in development patterns can aid in the explanation of their ontogenetic niche shifts. Due to the actual timing of switches in diet and habitat, it usually relates to changes in morphology of fish. The increase of mouth and jaw were significant in the ontogenetic dietary shift. The increase of body depth, fin length and eye size were also important to the mobile ability and feeding habitat shift in terapontid fishes. © 2017, Prince of Songkla University.

Method: ECa233 was orally given to both male and female Wistar rats at doses of 10, 100, and 1000 mg/kg/d for 90 days. Result and Conclusion: The results showed that all regimens of ECa233 did not affect the activities of UDPGT in both male and female rats. Furthermore, in line with our previous study in male rats, it was found that neither the activities of GST nor NQOR in female rats was modulated by ECa233. However, the activity of SULT, which had been found to significantly decrease in male rats, was unaltered in female rats.

However, current injection practice is not standardized and there is a clear need for structured training. An international group of experts in the management of patients with cervical dystonia (CD) and spastic paresis created a steering committee (SC). For each therapeutic area, the SC developed a core slide set on best practice, based on the literature. International sites of expertise were identified for training and courses were designed to include lectures and casebased learning. Where possible, courses received accreditation from the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Each course was peer reviewed by the SC, the UEMS accreditation board and the attendees themselves (through evaluation questionnaires). Attendees’ feedback was shared with the SC and the trainers to tailor future training sessions. From the program launch in 2012 to December 2014, 328 physicians from 34 countries were trained in a total of 58 courses; 67% of the courses focused on spastic paresis and 33% on CD. Of the 225 (69%) physicians who completed feedback forms, 95% rated their course as ‘above average/excellent’ in meeting the preset learning objectives. Most (90%) physicians declared that attending a course would lead them to change their practice.

Objective: This study has explored for the first time that vanillin, a natural compound from vanilla cured beans, has the ability to augment the stem cell property and signaling in the human HaCaT keratinocytes. Methods: The cell viability effect of vanillin on the keratinocytes was investigated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The Western blot analysis was performed to determine the level of stem cell-mediated proteins, mesenchymal, and epithelial markers. Results: Results showed that treatment of the HaCaT cells with vanillin at non-toxic concentrations was able to significantly up-regulate the stemness mediators Oct-4, p-Oct-4 and Nanog. Besides, we investigated the mesenchymal and epithelial makers and found that vanillin could increase the expression of epithelial adhesive protein E-cadherin but has no significant effect on mesenchymal mediator slug. Conclusions: As the stem cells, as well as their stemness properties, hold the central functions of skin renewal and repair, information gain from this study may benefit the development of vanillin to be used for skin therapy. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

The mean ± SD of averaged retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was 74.0 ± 6.1 μm, 100.2 ± 9.6 μm, and 105.8 ± 17.2 μm for glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, and controls, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity of HDR-DP was higher than that of C-DP (87% versus 68%, mean difference: 19.0, 95% CI: 4.91 to 33.1; p=0.014). Regarding diagnostic specificity, HDR-DP and C-DP yielded 46% and 75% (mean difference: 29.0, 95% CI: 13.4 to 44.6; p=0.002). Conclusions. HDR-DP statistically increased diagnostic sensitivity but not specificity. HDR-DP may be a screening tool for nonexpert ophthalmologists. © 2017 Mantapond Ittarat et al."
2-s2.0-85021989093,"The effect of the alkanol chain length in primary alkanolamines and the alkyl chain length in secondary and tertiary alkanolamines on CO2 absorption and desorption kinetics, equilibrium CO2 loading, heat duty, cyclic capacity, and pKa were studied. A selection strategy developed in our earlier work was used to identify potential solvents which could be used in a blend. Based on the strategy, alkanolamines that had a combination of high absorption parameter and high desorption parameter should be selected. The results of this study showed that, for absorption parameters, longer alkanol chain lengths of primary alkanolamines and longer alkyl chain lengths of secondary and tertiary alkanolamines led to higher equilibrium CO2 loading and pKa. However, the influence of mass transfer limitations on these positive effects resulted in a maximum trend for initial rate of CO2 absorption for secondary and tertiary alkanolamines. On the other hand, for the desorption parameters, the increase in the chain lengths also caused the generation of larger amounts of bicarbonate ions which resulted in higher CO2 desorption rates and cyclic capacity, but lower heat duty. However, the longer chain alkanolamines also had high viscosities which adversely modified their performance by also introducing mass transfer limitations. Based on chain length alone, BMEA came out as the best overall alkanolamine component which could be used in a blend. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-85022343243,"For the first time, 3D complex hollow Au microstructures (HL-AuMSs) fabricated via a 3D structure-preserving galvanic replacement approach are presented. 3D nanoporous Ag microstructures (np-AgMSs) are employed as templates, which are galvanically replaced by Au3+ under extremely high Cl- environments. During this galvanic replacement process, insoluble surface blocking AgCl species, is transformed under extremely high Cl- environments into a water soluble AgCl2- complex, which is easily liberated from the Ag surface. Therefore, chloride ion is the key parameter in the 3D morphological preservation of these templates. The preferential galvanic replacement is observed at the tips of np-AgMSs templates due to high charge density. The wall thickness of HL-AuMSs can be easily controlled by varying the mole ratio of Au3+:Ag. This 3D structure-preserving galvanic replacement is not only applied for various morphologies of Ag templates, but also applied for other precious metals with excellent template morphology retention. Moreover, due to this stabilizer-free protocol, the fabricated HL-AuMSs show efficient catalytic activity for the reduction of p-nitrophenol by NaBH4 within 10 minutes for 6 cycles. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017."
2-s2.0-85021956633,"Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, has an impact on both physical and mental functions of persons with Parkinson (PwP), who tend to lose their sense of empowerment, cognitive state of perceived competence and perceived control. A diminished sense of empowerment is a result of being dependent and unable to have control over their own lives and health. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the influence of disease-related knowledge and personality traits on empowerment of PwP. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey by a purposive sample of 128 PwP. Participants were interviewed with questionnaires: (1) Parkinson’s patient empowerment, (2) Health locus of control, (3) Self-esteem, and (4) Parkinson’s disease related knowledge related-knowledge. Results: Participants had mean age and disease duration of 58.3 ± 8.9 years, and 8.1 ± 4.8 years, respectively. Parkinson’s patient empowerment showed a significant positive relationship between variables such as self-esteem (r = 0.48, P < 0.001), internal health locus of control (IHLC) (r = 0.50, P < 0.001), external locus of control by powerful others (PHLC) (r = 0.32, P < 0.001), and self-care knowledge (r = 0.16, P = 0.039). There was a negative relationship between HY staging (r = −0.18, P = 0.023) and Parkinson’s patient empowerment. A significant regression equation was found (F(8, 119) = 10.68, P <0.001), with an adjusted R2 = 0.38. The multiple regression results revealed that self-esteem (β = 0.33, P < 0.001), IHLC (β = 0.29, P = 0.001), PHLC (β = 0.21, P = 0.014), and self-care knowledge (β = 0.18, P = 0.023) were significant influencing factors on Parkinson’s patient empowerment. Conclusions: Self-care knowledge, self-esteem, IHLC, and PHLC were four significant influential factors on Parkinson’s patient empowerment. Three proposed non-pharmacological treatment strategies to increase Parkinson’s patient empowerment were (1) Education interventions to focus on self-care knowledge, (2) Cognitive interventions to enhance patients’ feelings of self-worth and the beliefs of patients’ health influenced by their own behaviors, and (3) Strengthening patient-doctor relationship to enhance patients’ feelings of trust and to cooperate with doctors. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85021890746,"At present, Thailand does not have a national governance system for developing a health data standard and coding system, especially drug codes and medicine terminology. There is no single responsible organization and also no mechanism for cooperation among stakeholders to govern medicines terminology. This leads to difficulties of drug information exchange between health service units and drug utilization monitoring and evaluation at the national level. This study proposed a medicines terminology governance model for Thailand by applying a participatory research design. This researcher reviewed the experience from other countries that are very advanced in health information technology and then included all stakeholders as participants for interviewing. The interviews were iteratively done until the authors acquired enough data and saturation was reached then synthesized the medicines terminology governance model. The model confirmation step was conducted among 45 stakeholders in a stakeholder consultation seminar followed by usability testing. The governance model for medicines terminology was presented in three areas: Foundation, processes, and tools and services. The result demonstrated a responsible organization structure and functions, the collaborative network structure of stakeholders and cooperation process, and suggested tools and services facilitate users for medicines terminology governance. The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by six professional experts: The policy maker, medicines terminology administrator, drug manufacturer and distributor, health insurance scheme administrator, pharmacists or health-care professionals from the hospital and an expert in the national drug control section. In general, the professional experts agreed that the proposed model will suit the context and situation in Thailand. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

2-s2.0-85021819290,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa that commonly occurs in middle-aged or elderly women. In this paper, we describe a case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with red and white lesions in the oral cavity. Intraoral examination revealed a white plaque and white lines with a mild erythematous area on the right buccal mucosa, however, the left buccal mucosa showed only white striae and a mild erythematous area. Biopsy specimens taken twice from the right buccal mucosa demonstrated OLP characteristics. After 7-years of follow-up, an irregularly shaped ulcer was observed on the plaque lesion of the right buccal mucosa. A biopsy was performed again and the final diagnosis of superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma was made. OLP is classified as a potentially malignant disorder (PMD) of the oral mucosa. Histopathological examination is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude dysplasia and malignancy. Due to the malignant potential of OLP, long-term follow-up is strongly recommended, particularly in elderly patients with plaque-like OLP. © 2017 by Wroclaw Medical University and Polish Dental Society."
2-s2.0-85021801046,"Purpose: To investigate the inhibitory effects of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Linn.) extract on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Methods: Okra was extracted with ethanol by Soxhlet extraction. Non-cytotoxic doses of okra at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL were used in this study. BV2 cells were cultured and treated with LPS in the presence or absence of okra at the concentrations indicated above. ROS, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrotic factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) p65 and Akt were determined. Results: Treatment of BV2 cells with okra concentrations of 50, 100 and 200μg/mL significantly suppressed LPS-induced NO as well as ROS compared to untreated cells. There was also a significant decrease in the production of TNF-α and IL-1β in okra-treated BV2 microglia cells. The level of LPS-induced NF-kB p65 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by okra treatment. In addition, okra inhibited LPS-induced Akt phosphorylation, which is an upstream molecule of NF-kB. Conclusion: Okra exerts anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells by suppressing Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway. This suggests that okra might be a valuable agent for the treatment of anti-neuroinflammatory diseases mediated by microglial cells. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

2-s2.0-85021978053,"A novel phenylacetylene derivative containing the dicyanovinyl group (3) was successfully synthesized via Sonogashira coupling and a Knoevenagel reaction. Compound 3 could be used as a highly selective and sensitive turn-on fluorescent sensor for the detection of cyanide ions in aqueous solution. Upon the addition of cyanide ions, compound 3 changed from yellow to colorless which was readily observable by the naked eye. In addition, there was an increase of blue fluorescence emission under black light (365 nm) illumination. Using measurements of fluorescence intensity, the linear dynamic range for the quantitative analysis of cyanide concentration was determined to be 0-80 μM with a detection limit of 0.68 μM which is below the 1.9 μM limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water. 1H-NMR titration confirmed that the fluorescence turn-on signal is the result of a nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion to the β-position of the dicyanovinyl carbon. The addition of the cyanide ion disrupts the π-conjugation between the fluorescent phenylacetylene unit and the strong electron withdrawing dicyanovinyl group, thus inhibiting the non-radiative intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The application of compound 3 for the determination of cyanide in spiked samples of water and tapioca starch showed satisfactory results. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2017."
2-s2.0-85021693165,"Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is a promising technology and likely to be an important hydrogen generator. The ability to produce high purity hydrogen and deliver it at relatively high pressure is an important advantage of the PEM electrolyzer technology. In this work, the high pressure PEM electrolyzer without the need for external compression is studied. The simulation of the electrolyzer is performed based on an electrochemical model with consideration of hydrogen permeation. The effect of cathode pressure and membrane thickness on electrolyzer performance is studied. The explosion limit of a hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the anode is also taken into consideration. The electrochemical compression shows advantage in term of delivering hydrogen at high pressure with having less effect on performance and low power requirement. The increase of cathode pressure slightly affects the electrolyzer performance. The high pressure operation at the cathode and the use of thin membranes cause hydrogen crossover from the cathode to anode, especially at high current density operation. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."

The tribological performance of the composites performed in pin-on-disk tester was improved with adding larger NG particle size. It was found that the wear resistance of the composites was improved by increasing of the particle size. While, the increased NG particle size reduced the friction coefficient of the composites from 0.36 to 0.31. In term of mechanical properties under flexural test, i.e. flexural modulus and flexural strength, the NG particles with the largest size possessed the suitable reinforcement ability. Glass transition temperature evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis and the degradation temperature at 5 % weight loss measured by thermogravimetric analysis of the composites was in a temperature range of 195 °C - 215 °C and 387 °C - 402 °C, respectively. Therefore, the obtained outstanding properties, i.e. friction coefficient, flexural modulus and strength, glass transition temperature, and degradation temperature make the polybenzoxazine composites highly attractive to be utilized as friction materials. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."
2-s2.0-85021691511,"Steam biomass gasification has been considered the most favorable option for production of syngas. Nevertheless, the steam biomass gasification is inevitably problematic with undesirable CO2 and tar formed during the process. Calcium oxide (CaO), when added to the gasification, could play the dual role of tar cracking catalyst and CO2 sorbent, and thereby producing more hydrogen. The CO2 capture process is the carbonation reaction of CO2 and CaO to produce CaCO3. In general, CaCO3 can be regenerated at high temperatures and then reused within the cyclic process. Nonetheless, a major disadvantage of the steam biomass gasification with in situ CO2 capture process is due to high external heat requirement in a regenerator. In this study, the sorption enhanced chemical looping biomass gasification, which is operated without heating and cooling system, for high-purity hydrogen production is investigated. Model of the gasification is developed using ASPEN Plus process simulator and used to analyze its energy efficiency performance. The results show that the maximum energy efficiency performance is 57.67% at the operating conditions of steam to carbon ratio = 2.6, temperature = 636 °C, CaO to carbon ratio = 1 and nickel oxide to carbon ratio = 1.06. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."
2-s2.0-85021658559,"High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising technologies to store excess renewable energy generation. In this work, the mathematical model of SOEC, which can describe the behaviour of a cathode-supported SOEC operating for H2O and CO2 co-electrolysis, is developed from mass balance, dusty gas model, and electrochemical model. The validated SOEC model is used to analyse the influence of the reversible water-gas shift reaction taking place on the cathode on the performance of the SOEC for syngas production. The simulation results show that the reverse water-gas shift reaction is highly pronounced at the cathode surface due to high CO2 component and can contribute to CO production. The rate of water-gas shift reaction increases along the depth of the cathode to the three-phase boundary. At the three-phase boundary, an increase in operating temperatures results in the enhancement of the rate of water-gas shift reaction. Additionally, regarding the SOEC performance, the electrical energy consumed for co-electrolysis in SOEC decreases with increasing temperature because the activation overpotentials and ohmic overpotentials are lower. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."

However, little is known about the influence of immunization on T cell subsets' distribution during the course of infection. This study aims to identify the impact of viral replication and immunization on naïve, effector, effector memory, and central memory T cell subpopulations in ART-treated HIV-infected children. Fifty patients were recruited and injected intramuscularly with influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine on the day of enrollment (day 0) and day 28. Blood samples were collected for pre- and postvaccination on days 0 and 56 for analyzing T cell phenotypes by flow cytometry. Phenotypes of all T cell subsets remained the same after vaccination, except for a reduction in effector CD8+ T cells. Moreover, T cell subsets from patients with controllable viral load showed similar patterns to those with virological failure. Absolute CD4 count was also found to have a positive relationship with naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, vaccination and viral replication have a little effect on the distribution of T cell subpopulations. The CD4 count can be used for prediction of naïve T cell level in HIV-infected patients responding to ART. © 2017 Premrutai Thitilertdecha et al."

Hydrogen ASBR unit was operated at a constant pH of 5.5 whereas the pH of methane ASBR unit was not controlled. Glycerin was added into biodiesel wastewater having 2330 mg/l COD to obtain a constant feed chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 45,000 m/l. At optimum COD loading rate 11.3 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume), the system provided the highest overall hydrogen and methane production performance (75.15 ml H2/g glycerin removed) which was consistent with the maximum overall COD removal of 76.7% and the highest overall glycerin uptake of 90%. Most of added glycerin was converted to gaseous products with small amounts of organic acids and 1,3 propanediol. The low volumetric ratio of hydrogen ASBR unit-to-methane ASBR unit of 1:6 resulted in low hydrogen yields with high methane yields.

In this study, a sequential organosolv fractionation of sugarcane bagasse and saccharification of the cellulose-enriched pulp in hot compressed water using a coupled heterogenous acid promoter/catalyst was studied. Among the liquid and solid acids tested, H3PO4-Activated carbon showed a high performance on promoting selectivity and yield in fractionation related to its high BET surface area and acid site density. Fractionation in a ternary mixture of methyl isolbutylketone:methanol:water (16:68:16) at 180 °C for 60 min using 5%w/w H3PO4-Activated carbon resulted in 88.9% recovery of cellulose enriched in the solid, together with 84.6% recovery of the hemicellulose as pentoses in the aqueous-alcohol fraction and 76.0% lignin in the organic phase. With no separation of the solid acid, the cellulose fraction could be further hydrolyzed under hot compressed water conditions at 225 °C for 10 min, resulting in the maximal hexose yield of 58.3% from the starting material.

After oxidation pretreatment, the Hastelloy showed good activity towards methanol steam reforming. The Cr and Mn promoters on the surface increased with the increase of oxidation temperature, resulting in the improvement of steam reforming activity. The Ni alloy appeared after pretreatment and controlled the oxidation state of Ni, leading to the decrease of methanation. The oxidation pretreatment at 1273 K provided the highest catalytic performance, but the agglomeration apparently occurred. The scales on the surface combined together when the oxidation was longer than two hours.

Due to a high-temperature operation of SOFC, useful heat can be recovered to enhance its system efficiency. Regarding the environmental concern, bio-oil, the renewable liquid fuel, can be applied to SOFC system. In this study, the SOFC integrated with a steam reforming of bio-oil is considered. A sorption enhanced reforming process is studied for the production of high purity hydrogen for SOFC, and the anode gas recirculation in the SOFC system is proposed for the system improvement. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed using Aspen Plus simulator. As heat and power are generated from the SOFC system, the effect of key design parameters; fuel utilization and recirculation ratio of the anode gas, on a heatto-power ratio is analyzed. The system performance regarding to the electrical and thermal efficiencies is also evaluated. The results show that increasing the anode recirculation ratio increases the combined heat and power (CHP) performance, but increasing the fuel utilization decreases the thermal efficiency.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the existence of FM operation strategy and to add empirical evidence to this subject to the field of FM and property management. Its main objectives are to gain insights into the arrangement of the FM strategic choices in operation and its relationship with business strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The study investigated the configurations of operational approaches and activities that should reflect strategic decisions. The investigation was undertaken through a study of four reputed shopping malls located in Bangkok. The relevant data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the key FM persons of each case study, plus archival document searches, and observations of operational processes. Subsequently, the data were examined in a cross-case analysis to identify the key patterns of relationships between the FM operational arrangements and the business strategy of the mall. Findings: This study found that the functional scheme of FM adopted in operations was deliberately related to the needs of business strategy and the operations of the given shopping mall. A range of strategic choices for FM operations was also found. Certain choices are shared among the case studies, while their arrangements varied according to the particular business strategy and context. Research limitations/implications: The number of case studies was rather limited, while the results were predominantly involved with a single type of facility. Originality/value: The study identified the pattern of strategic choices entailed in the FM operations in shopping malls. The findings add to the understanding on FM strategy by widening the perspectives about the strategic choices of FM operations and how they are connected with the business strategy and operation model of retail estate.

One hundred Babcock 308 female layer chickens were randomly divided into five groups of 20 each. Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were different positive control groups of immunized chickens with commercial trivalent mineral oil vaccine, and prepared bacterins of Avibacterium paragallinarum serovars A (221), B (0222) and C (Modesto), respectively. The chickens in Group 5 were assigned as a negative control. Positive and negative control sera from the chickens in Groups 1-5 at 2 weeks after the second vaccination were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed I-ELISA. Forty negative control sera (taken before vaccination) were used to evaluate cut-off values of the I-ELISA against each serovar of A. paragallinarum under optimal conditions. The cut-off values of serovars A, B and C, calculated by the mean optical density of all negative sera plus three standard deviations, were 0.334, 0.484 and 0.678, respectively. Efficacy of the developed I-ELISA showed 100% sensitivity for all three serovars of coating antigen, but with low specificity of 30% for all three serovars because of high cross-reactivity among the serovars, while the agreement rate between the I-ELISA and HI assay for serovars A, B and C was around 60%. Nevertheless, the serovar A I-ELISA gave a higher response to serovar A antiserum than to the other two heterologous serovars (p < 0.05). In contrast, the I-ELISA results for B and C did not show any significant differences between the homologous and heterologous serovars. This newly developed I-ELISA could be an alternative method for differentiating between A. paragallinarum-free chickens and those that have received vaccination, but could not clearly differentiate antibodies among the three serovars of A. paragallinarum."

Previous studies have been limited by the reliance on data from university students and other non-representative samples, with little comparability across countries in the region. This research brief addresses this gap by comparing attitudes toward lesbians and gay men and about lesbian and gay sexualities in six Southeast Asian countries using nationally representative survey data. Combined data from the World Values Survey (total n = 9,182 respondents from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) indicated that many Southeast Asians reject lesbians or gay men as neighbors, with the most homonegative attitudes to be found in Indonesia (66%) and Malaysia (59%), compared to relatively less rejecting nations like Thailand (40%), Singapore (32%), Vietnam (29%), and the Philippines (28%). Same-sex sexuality was least acceptable, based on a moral justifiability measure, among Indonesians, followed by Vietnamese and Malaysians.

The best killing activity was found with enrofloxacin alone, with a log reduction of 3.96 ± 0.49 (97.96-100.00% kill) within 2 hr of drug administration, followed by the simultaneous combination with a log reduction of 3.78 ± 0.37 (98.73-100.00% kill) within 6 hr, and the separated combination with a log reduction of 3.51 ± 0.47 (99.19-100.00% kill) within 12 hr. Comparing time to 3 log reduction (T3K), the separated combination killed E. coli significantly slower than enrofloxacin alone (8.04 ± 0.94 vs 2.47 ± 0.40 hr; p < 0.05), which was consistent with time to elimination (TE) (14.97 ± 1.35 vs 5.83 ± 0.58 hr; p < 0.05). This study establishes that the killing activities of enrofloxacin were reduced and delayed when used in combination with doxycycline, especially with 12-hour doxycycline pre-treatment, suggesting the antagonistic interaction between enrofloxacin and doxycycline when concurrently used against E. coli from dogs and cats."
2-s2.0-85021141907,"Three-dimensional Thai silk fibroin-based scaffolds have been developed and reported in our previous study on their appropriate morphology, physical properties and, in particular, promising potential to promote the growth of bone cells in vitro. Moreover, our previous study found that they were non-toxic to cells in vivo. In this work, three types of Thai silk fibroin-based scaffolds, including conjugated gelatin/Thai silk fibroin scaffold (CGSF), hydroxyapatite/conjugated gelatin/Thai silk fibroin scaffold (CGSF4) and hyaluronic acid/Thai silk fibroin scaffold (HSF), were investigated for their in vivo osteogenic potential in rat model. Each Thai silk fibroin-based scaffold was implanted in the bone defect (6 mm) on the radius bone of Wistar rats for 12 weeks. Bone regeneration was analyzed by micro-CT and semi-quantitative data evaluated from histological slides, compared to the control group (no implanted scaffold). The micro-CT result showed that the most pronounced new bone was noticed in the implant case of CGSF4 scaffold. The result of histopathologically semi-quantitative analysis showed that all scaffolds could enhance new bone formation. As a result, the Thai silk fibroin scaffold modified with gelatin conjugation and hydroxyapatite deposition (CGSF4) possessed great potential for being employed as bone scaffold for bone tissue engineering application."
2-s2.0-85021140274,"In the present study we examined the effects of stem cell factor (SCF; 50 vs 100ngmL-1) alone or in combination with epidermal growth factor (EGF; 100ngmL-1) on: (1) the in vitro viability and growth of cat follicles within ovarian cortices; (2) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation; and (3) c-kit and FSH receptor (FSHr) mRNA expression. At 100ngmL-1, SCF increased (P≤0.05) the percentage and size of secondary follicles after 14 days of in vitro culture and sustained AKT phosphorylation after 3 days incubation. EGF suppressed this beneficial effect and reduced (P≤0.05) the percentage of structurally normal follicles and FSHr expression when combined with 100ngmL-1 SCF. Expression of c-kit mRNA was higher (P≤0.05) in the presence of 100ngmL-1 SCF compared with fresh follicles and cohorts cultured under other conditions. A c-kit inhibitor suppressed follicle growth and reduced AKT phosphorylation. Collectively, the results demonstrate that SCF promotes cat follicle development by upregulating c-kit mRNA expression and AKT phosphorylation. EGF suppresses the stimulating effect of SCF, leading to downregulation of FSHr expression. © CSIRO 2017."
2-s2.0-85021126830,"The objective of this study was to distinguish between cats with cardiac disease and non-cardiac disease by using parameters obtained from thoracic radiographs. This study was performed in 49 cats with a mean age of 7.7±4.79 years. Weight, sex and breed of all cats were randomly chosen. Echocardiography was used as a gold standard to diagnose cardiac disease and separate the cats into two groups, cardiac disease (n=31) and non-cardiac disease (n=18). Five parameters were measured from the right lateral radiographs including 1) the cardiac length (L), 2) the cardiac width (W), 3) the width of the caudal vena cava (CVC), 4) the height of the spinous process of the fourth thoracic vertebrae (sT4), and 5) the length of the fourth sternal thoracic bone (S4). Ten formulae were designed from the five parameters. Five of these formulae produced an outcome showing a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). These formulae included L•W, L•W/sT4, L•W/S4, SUMLW/S4, and SUMLW•CVC. This study recommends the formulae L•W (cut-off > 16.45 cm2; sensitivity of 82.2% and specificity of 67%) and L•W/S4 (cut-off > 12.85 cm; sensitivity of 81.7% and specificity of 66.9%). In conclusion, these two new formulae can be used as a screening tool for distinguishing cats with cardiac and non-cardiac diseases."
2-s2.0-85021100523,"The relationship between humans and computers is called human computer interaction (HCI). HCI is a major research topic in the area of assistive technology. In the field of medical assistive technology specifically, a hand gesture is considered a suitable method to convey information. It can help elderly people, who are unable to walk or speak, communicate with caregivers whenever they need help. This paper proposes a system to recognize the hand gestures of elderly people using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. A vision-based algorithm is developed to detect and classify dynamic hand gestures in real time on the Raspberry Pi embedded platform. There are three main procedures; contour detection, convex extraction, and rule-based classification. The system can detect six different gestures on both hands in various orientations. The experiment showed good results in detecting and classifying their meanings as lingual descriptions."

However, the study about vector competence for CHIKV in Thailand is limited. This study was conducted to examine the effects of CHIKV titers in blood meals on vector competence of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). Five groups of Ae. albopictus were allowed to feed on different levels of CHIKV in the blood meals which were 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 CID50/ml of CHIKV. Body, legs and wings, and saliva samples from blood-fed mosquitoes were assayed for the presence of CHIKV by using immunocytochemistry staining on day 14 post blood feeding. Percent virus infection, dissemination, and transmission is defined as percent of blood-fed mosquitoes with virus in their bodies, legs and wings, and saliva, respectively. The percent infections were 83.3, 90, 100, 100, and 100%, the percent disseminations were 70.8, 86.7, 100, 90, and 98%, and the percent transmissions were 41.6, 70, 100, 90, and 82.4% after having been fed on 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 CID50/ml of CHIKV, respectively. However, there was no significant difference of the percent transmission after having been fed on 104 and 105 CID50/ml of CHIKV. This study suggested that Ae. albopictus are susceptible for CHIKV infection and efficient vectors for CHIKV transmission, and CHIKV titers in blood meals have effects on virus infection, dissemination, and transmission in Ae. albopictus or vector competence of this mosquito."
2-s2.0-85021053936,"Zr-SBA-15 materials have been successfully synthesized using the direct synthesis method in self-generated acidic conditions. The diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV-vis) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results revealed that most of the zirconium species could be incorporated into silica framework. No agglomeration of Zr species was detected in the silica framework and at the extra-framework. Nevertheless, the continuous diminution of BET surface area, total pore volume, and pore width with increase in Zr/Si molar ratios was distinctly observed, which resulted from the deposition of some tiny and well-dispersed Zr species at the inner pore walls and/or external surface areas. The Zr incorporation also resulted in the augmentation of the microporous characteristics of all materials. The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed under ambient conditions (25 °C and 1 bar) in order to meet the broad needs of industry and household. The largest amount of CO2 uptake was demonstrated by 0.03Zr-SBA-15 at around 0.68 mmol/g (29.92 mg/g). The CO2 adsorption capability of these materials correlated considerably with their textural properties, particularly microporous volume (VMicro). © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

2-s2.0-85020919651,"Purpose: Janus kinase (JAK) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) play critical functions in T-cell activation and in inflammation. Because of their antiinflammatory effects, JAK and SYK inhibitors have recently been evaluated in several immunopathogenic disorders. This pilot study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a topical combined JAK/SYK inhibitor, R348, ophthalmic solution for treatment of ocular surface disease in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Methods: This phase 2, double-masked, randomized, pilot trial included 30 patients with ocular surface disease due to GVHD who were randomized to receive topical 0.5% R348, 0.2% R348, or vehicle, twice daily for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation was performed, which included Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Ocular Comfort Index questionnaire, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and Schirmer test with anesthesia. Changes in these parameters were compared between the 3 groups. Results: The mean decrease in total corneal fluorescein staining at 12 weeks after treatment was higher in the 0.5% R348 group (26.0 ± 3.9, NEI scoring) compared with the vehicle (22.1 ± 2.6, P = 0.045) or the 0.2% R348 group (24.1 ± 3.6, P = 0.34). However, there were no significant differences among the groups in terms of treatment-induced changes in OSDI, Ocular Comfort Index, conjunctival lissamine green staining, or Schirmer scores. R348 eye drops were well tolerated. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that 0.5% R348 JAK/SYK inhibitor ophthalmic solution is well tolerated and may have some therapeutic efficacy in treating ocular GVHD. Larger trials are required to derive more definitive data. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85020552496,"The assessment of slope stability is an essential task in geotechnical engineering. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to investigate the performance of different shear pin arrangements to increase the stability of a soil block resting on an inclined plane with a low-interface friction plane. In the numerical models, the soil block was modeled by volume elements with linear elastic perfectly plastic material in a drained condition, while the shear pins were modeled by volume elements with linear elastic material. Interface elements were used along the bedding plane (bedding interface element) and around the shear pins (shear pin interface element) to simulate the soil-structure interaction. Bedding interface elements were used to capture the shear sliding of the soil on the low-interface friction plane while shear pin interface elements were used to model the shear bonding of the soil around the pins. A failure analysis was performed by means of the gravity loading method. The results of the 3D FEA with the numerical models were compared to those with the physical models for all cases. The effects of the number of shear pins, the shear pin locations, the different shear pin arrangements, the thickness and the width of the soil block and the associated failure mechanisms were discussed. © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd."

The phosphorus availability and total cellular phosphorus content were enhanced in the Δall4501 strain lacking this negative regulator, while, growth curve was similar to the wild type. The initial rate of phosphate uptake and cellular phosphorus content of the Δall4501 strain were 8-times and 2-times higher than the wild type strain. Increasing of cellular phosphorus content was clearly shown that phosphorus was stored as polyphosphate granules. Phosphorus removal from recirculating aquaculture system using the Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 strain Δall4501 was performed in a 5 L photobioreactor. Separation of treated water and cyanobacterial cells could be achieved spontaneously via simple settle down method.

2-s2.0-85020793670,"It is well known that the atmospheric effects are the most dominant spatially correlated errors in GNSS observations. The atmosphere causing the delay in GNSS observations consists of two main layers Le. ionosphere and troposphere. The ionospheric delay can be mitigated using a linear combination of the two-frequency data. Unlike the ionospheric delay, the tropospheric delay cannot be removed using the same methodology. Compensation for the tropospheric delay is usually carried out using a standard tropospheric model. However, a standard tropospheric model cannot be used to completely remove the tropospheric delay in GNSS observations. With the use of GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique, the tropospheric delay can be precisely obtained in a data processing step. Therefore, this paper focuses on an estimation of precise tropospheric delay using the GNSS PPP technique with the Positioning and Navigation Data Analyst (PANDA) software. Results obtained from the PPP technique are then compared with IGS tropospheric products and standard tropospheric models e.g. Saastamonien, modified Hopfield and simplified Hopfield. The obtained tropospheric delay shows a good agreement with the IGS product at millimeter level. It is found that the standard tropospheric models can only provide tropospheric corrections which are accurate at decimeter level in Thailand region. Finally, the same processing procedure is applied to produce precise tropospheric delays for all GNSS Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) in Thailand and initial tropospheric delay results are presented in this paper. © Geoiniormatics International."

They have been characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and UV–Vis), conductance measurements and magnetic susceptibility studies. Single crystal X-ray structure determination showed that complexes 1 and 3 crystallize in the monoclinic system with space group P21/c, while complex 2 crystallizes in the triclinic system with space group P1¯ all in centrosymmetric space groups. The X-ray analysis of complexes 1–3 clearly revealed their ionic structures, consisting of one complex cation, [Cu(N-hyden)2]2+, and two respective substituted arylcarboxylate (o-/m-/p-methoxybenzoate) anions. The Cu(II) center in each complex is octahedrally coordinated to two tridentate N-hyden ligands, in which two nitrogen and one oxygen atoms of two N-hyden ligands are coordinated in trans geometries.

2-s2.0-85020644237,"In this work, transparent thin film zinc-manganese dioxide (Zn-MnO2) batteries were fabricated using an inexpensive screen-printing technique. Both electrodes were fabricated as micro-electrode arrays with feature size of 50 μm, which are below resolution of human eyes. Thus, the electrodes appeared transparent. Moreover, a transparent alkaline polymer gel electrolyte (PGE) film prepared by polymerization of acrylate, potassium hydroxide and water was used as a quasi-solid-state electrolyte. The PGE film functioned as both an electrolyte and an insulator/separator. Three patterns of the micro-electrodes with different percentages of opening area (75%, 80% and 85%) were investigated. The open-circuit voltages of the batteries fabricated were 1.25 V. Ohmic loss zones were 0.1-2.0 mA.cm-2. The battery with an opening area of 80% provided an average transparency of 90% without significantly affecting battery performance. Moreover, energy density of the battery could be further increased by increasing the thickness of the electrodes. By increasing the thickness of the micro-electrodes upto 80 μm, energy density of the battery was significantly enhanced without loosing its transparency. © 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

The polymer solution was cast directly on a glass substrate without any backing fabric to prepare the support layer. All resultant supports showed a fingerlike pore structure. The addition of a more hydrophilic polymer (sPEEK) to the polymer solution induced pores in the bottom layer of the support with average pore diameters ranging from 0.07 to 0.30 μm, which improved water flux. Bottom surface porosities were simply controlled by adjusting the polymer blend ratios. FO experiments were carried out in a high-throughput (HT) crossflow FO cell with DI water and a 0.5 M NaCl solution as feed and draw solution, respectively. TFC membranes with 5% sPEEK showed a water flux in PRO mode of 14.3 LMH and in FO mode of 6.2 LMH, which is superior to the commercial cellulose triacetate (CTA) and TFC membranes (HTI).

Methods: We organized a Bio-Innovation Symposium at Taiwan National University, before which participants (68) from Taipei and other regions responded to an English/Chinese survey with views on how to implement POCT. We analyzed Hualien County geospatially and compared geometrics with/without POCT. Results: Multidisciplinary respondents (34%, 23/68) suggested medical technologists be coordinators responsible for device management, education/ training, communications across departments, preparation/maintenance of compliance documents, and performance assurance; 93% suggested P&G cover highly infectious diseases (Ebola,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika); and 81% agreed POCT-equipped isolation laboratories are necessary. Ranked priorities for POCTwere acute myocardial infarction (34%), infectious diseases (22%), diabetes (21%), acute heart failure (13%), and blood gas/electrolytes (9%). Most (75%) suggested P&G be integrated, created by both local and national agencies (52%). Reliability (29%) and device management (18%) were top priorities. Most (71%) said hospitals should select instruments, whereas medical technologists administrate (59%) and perform (50%) POCT. Conclusions: Bio-innovators are enthusiastically creating POC technologies in Taiwan, including low marginal cost assay modules capable of transforming public health paradigms. Geospatial analysis showed that POCT can speed acute response in rural areas of Hualien County. At a national convocation of the Taiwan Association ofMedical Technologists, P&G receptivity and support were strong, suggesting Taiwan will publish national POCT P&G.

Eyes treated with PGAs were photographed and independently evaluated for PAP by 2 glaucoma specialists using at least 4 out of 7 clinical appearances. The factors of interest were sex, age, body mass index (BMI), types of glaucoma, types of PGAs, duration of PGA use, and concurrent 0.5% timolol. Univariate (X2 test) and multivariate (multiple logistic regression) analyses assessing risk factors for PAP were performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: One hundred thirty-four eyes from 134 patients were included. Seventy (52.2%), 21 (15.7%), and 43 (32%) eyes received components of latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost, respectively. Prevalence of PAP was 44.8% (95% CI, 36.3 to 53.3). Older age > 60 years (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 7.8), bimatoprost (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 9.5), travoprost (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 10.1), and timolol (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.8) were at risk of PAP development.

2-s2.0-85020005278,"To avoid a carbon formation in the ethanol steam reforming process from the polymerization of ethylene, a two-step reforming of ethanol via a dehydrogenation reaction and a steam reforming reaction for hydrogen production is proposed in this work. The study of using a CaO sorbent for CO2 capture to enhance the hydrogen production for solid oxide fuel cells is also carried out. Modeling of the two-step ethanol steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell integrated process based on a thermodynamic approach is performed using a flowsheet simulator. The results show that the presence of CaO in the two-step ethanol steam reforming process has several advantages, such as having higher hydrogen yield, gaining additional heat, and providing a higher power output at a relative low reforming temperature. However, the exergy analysis indicates that this process has a higher total exergy destruction compared to the process without CaO because of the high amount of heat needed in the regenerator. Therefore, a heat allocation technique based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics is used to identify the optimal operating condition. The results show that when the reformer is operated at a temperature of 800 K and a steam-to-ethanol ratio of one, the minimum total exergy destruction to power ratio can be achieved and heat is also sufficient. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019963824,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine how iterative reconstruction technology (IRT) influences contrast and spatial resolution in ultralow-dose dentomaxillofacial CT imaging. Methods: A polymethyl methacrylate phantom with various inserts was scanned using a reference protocol (RP) at CT dose index volume 36.56 mGy, a sinus protocol at 18.28 mGy and ultralow-dose protocols (LD) at 4.17 mGy, 2.36 mGy, 0.99 mGy and 0.53 mGy. All data sets were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and the following IRTs: adaptive statistical iterative reconstructions (ASIRs) (ASIR-50, ASIR-100) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Inserts containing line-pair patterns and contrast detail patterns for three different materials were scored by three observers. Observer agreement was analyzed using Cohen's kappa and difference in performance between the protocols and reconstruction was analyzed with Dunn's test at α=0.05. Results: Interobserver agreement was acceptable with a mean kappa value of 0.59. Compared with the RP using FBP, similar scores were achieved at 2.36 mGy using MBIR. MIBR reconstructions showed the highest noise suppression as well as good contrast even at the lowest doses. Overall, ASIR reconstructions did not outperform FBP. Conclusions: LD and MBIR at a dose reduction of >90% may show no significant differences in spatial and contrast resolution compared with an RP and FBP.

Rats were divided into 5 groups as follows: control (group 1, n=8), hyperoxaluric rats (group 2, n=8), hyperoxaluric rats with vitamin E supplement (group 3, n=7), hyperoxaluric rats with vitamin C supplement (group 4, n=7) and hyperoxaluric rats with vitamin E and C supplement (group 5, n=7). Hyperoxaluria was induced by feeding hydroxyl L-proline (HLP) 2% w/v dissolved in drinking water. Intraperitoneal 200 mg/kg of vitamin E was given in groups 3 and 5 on days 1, 6, 11 and 16, while 500 mg of vitamin C was injected intravenously in groups 4 and 5 on days 1 and 11. Renal functions and oxidative status were measured. The urinary oxalate excretion was increased in HLP supplement rats, while glomerular filtration rate, proximal water and sodium reabsorption were significantly lower in group 2 compared with a control (P<0.05). Giving antioxidants significantly lower urinary calcium oxalate crystals (P<0.05). Hyperoxaluric rats had higher plasma malondialdehyde (PMDA) and lower urinary total antioxidant status (UTAS), which were alleviated by vitamin E and/or vitamin C supplement.

At the most recent evaluation, patient functional status was rated by the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and radiographic changes were graded according to Tönnis criteria. Complications were defined as Tönnis grade >2 or hip requiring further surgery. Univariate analysis was used to explore factors associated with complications. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated between HHS and Tönnis grading. Results: At mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 2.6 (range 1.1-9.5) years, mean HHS was 87.4. Tönnis grading was rated as 0 in 10 hips, 1 in 5 hips, 2 in 2 hips, and 3 in 3 hips. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head as a complication developed in 3 hips (15%). Clinical parameters including age at surgery, duration of follow-up and diagnosis were not significantly associated with postoperative complications. A negative correlation between HHS and Tönnis grade was shown by Spearman’s rank correlation (rs = -0.49, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The AMG can be safely recommended as an adjunct bone graft procedure when performing anterior open reduction of adolescent and active adult hip disorders. © 2017 Wichtig Publishing."
2-s2.0-85019867411,"The photoautotrophically grown cyanobacterium Oscillatoria okeni TISTR 8549 was found to produce bioplastic poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). This PHBV production occurred under nitrogen deprivation (–N) that yielded PHBV accumulation of 14 ± 4% (w/w DW) in which 3-hydroxyvalerate accounted for 5.5 mol%. The heterotrophically grown (–N condition with acetate supplementation) cells under light showed no increase of PHBV storage, but under dark condition these cells increased PHBV accumulation to 42 ± 8% (w/w DW) with 6.5 mol% of 3-hydroxyvalerate. Compared to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), the PHBV from O. okeni had a lower melting temperature by 5–7 °C, a higher % elongation at break by 4–7 times and a greater Young's elastic modulus by 2.3–2.5 times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85019870122,"Purpose: Many histologic and histomorphometric studies as well as systematic reviews have shown the clinical success of the use of anorganic bovine bone (ABB, Bio-Oss) in maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA). The molecular processes involved in bone healing are, however, still unknown. The aims of this study were to explore gene expression associated with bone remodeling and inflammation in MSFA sites. Materials and Methods: The mRNA expression levels of runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase (TRAP), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), as well as the ratio of RANKL/OPG were compared between alveolar bone of a group after MSFA with ABB and a maxillary posterior edentulous bone group. Twenty-one bone samples were collected at the time of implant placement after 6 months of MSFA or tooth extraction. Fourteen bone samples from the MSFA group and from the maxillary posterior edentulous bone without MSFA group were taken to analyze gene expression by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Seven bone samples from the MSFA group were used for histologic analysis. Results: Real time RT-PCR revealed no statistically significant difference in gene expression level of RUNX2, RANKL, OPG, MMP-9, TRAP, and IL-1β, or in the ratio of RANKL/OPG. Histology showed bone-lining cells at the edge and osteocyte inside newly formed bone. Residual grafted particles were in close contact with new bone. Conclusion: After a healing period of 6 months, ABB particles did not have an effect on the expression of genes associated with bone remodeling and inflammation. In addition, histologic evidence supports that ABB particles are replaced by new bone formation and do not affect bone healing. © 2017 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc."
2-s2.0-85019987369,"Objective. To evaluate retinal vascular structural change in ocular Behcet's using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and fluorescein angiography (FA). Methods. An analytic cross-sectional study of 37 eyes of 21 Behcet's uveitic patients was performed. Foveal retinal thickness (FRT), perifoveal hypoperfusion areas in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were measured with swept-source optical coherence tomography and OCTA. FA images were used for assessing the vascular features and correlation. Results. Twenty-one patients were enrolled (52.4% males). The average age at onset was 36.7 ± 12.93 years. The median of disease duration was 5 years (1-25). FRT was 118.1 ± 52.35 μm, which correlated with visual acuity (95% CI -60.47, -13.92). Using OCTA, the area of hypoperfusion in SCP (0.47 ± 0.17 mm2) was smaller than that in DCP (1.94 ± 3.87 mm2) (p<0.001). Superficial to deep capillary plexus nonperfusion (SCP: DCP) ratio was 0.57 ± 0.27 which had the positive coefficient correlation with visual acuity (95% CI -0.644, -0.015). Conclusions. OCTA is an alternative noninvasive method to monitor macular ischemia in Behcet. Behcet's uveitis affects DCP more than SCP. Decreasing SCP: DCP ratio and decrease FRT correlates with poor visual acuity. Macular ischemia and DCP loss can be found early and can explain vision loss in Behcet. © 2017 Thanapong Somkijrungroj et al."
2-s2.0-85019861571,"Infective endocarditis is an infection with a high mortality rate. Antimicrobial therapy is important for treatment, but data on antimicrobial susceptibilities are limited. This retrospective study analyzed data on the causative microorganisms and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in patients with infective endocarditis 18 years of age or older who received inpatient care between 2006 and 2015 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. A total of 213 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Streptococcus spp. (54.5%) was the most common organism. Viridans streptococcus (46%) was the leading pathogen, followed by Group B streptococcus (27%). The majority of Streptococcus spp. were susceptible to penicillin (82.7%). Among Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus suis had the highest MIC of penicillin and cefotaxime 90 (1.65 and 0.95 µg/ml, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in the MICs of penicillin and cefotaxime for Streptococcus suis (P = 0.03 and 0.04). Only 45.5% of Streptococcus suis and 77.5% of Viridans streptococcus were susceptible to penicillin. All Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were susceptible to vancomycin. In conclusion, the prevalence of Group B streptococcus isolates increased among patients with infective endocarditis in Thailand. Streptococcus suis had the highest MIC90 and proportion of isolates not susceptible to penicillin. Rigorous restriction of the use of antimicrobial agents in animal feeds should be a primary concern. © 2017, National Institute of Health. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85019820391,"Background: Vitamin D, a potent immune-modulator, has been linked to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study was aimed at investigating the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin-D-related genes and treatment response to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) in patients with CHB. Methods: A total of 275 Thai patients (122 hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive and 153 HBeAg-negative CHB) treated with 48-week PEG-IFN were recruited. Virological response (VR) at 48 weeks post-treatment was defined as HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA <2,000 IU/ml for HBeAg-positive CHB and HBV DNA <2,000 IU/ml for HBeAg-negative CHB. The SNPs VDR (rs2228570), DBP (rs7041) and CYP27B1 (rs4646536) were analysed. Results: The distribution of TT, CT and CC genotypes of rs4646536 in this cohort was 21.8%, 46.2% and 32.0%, respectively. There was no difference in its distribution according to HBeAg status. In HBeAg-positive CHB, patients with TT genotype, compared with non-TT genotype, achieved higher VR (53.3% versus 31.5%; P=0.032) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance (20.0% versus 5.4%; P=0.016). In HBeAg-negative CHB, the corresponding figures were 60.0% versus 30.9% (P=0.003) and 16.7% versus 5.7% (P=0.045), respectively. Patients with TT genotype had more rapid HBsAg decline than those with non-TT genotype. However, SNPs rs2228570 and rs7041were not associated with VR and HBsAg clearance. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that SNP rs4646536 and baseline HBsAg level were independent predictors of VR in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB. Conclusions: Our data suggest that SNP rs4646536 in the CYP27B1 gene is a predictive factor of response to PEG-IFN therapy in Thai patients with CHB. © 2017 International Medical Press."

This review has been done by using data, recovered through Pub Med, Scopus and ISI Web of science. The point of this analysis was about these six below mentioned outcomes such as- health and well-being, living arrangements, use of health facilities, process-related health outcomes, income, or support. Seventy-two studies were published about this included this review within 1994 to 2016. Different methods and techniques such as quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods were used in these studies. In 51.4 % cases Probability sampling methods and in 44.5% cases purposive sampling methods were used. 31.9% of the information was taken from the national survey data. The data sources of these studies were taken primarily from the outpatients of the hospitals and secondarily from the primary health care centers who acted as the participants. These studies and analysis have determined different types of outcomes. Some outcomes indicate that the public health policies and programs on aging are not acting as a whole development program. On the other hand, some outcomes indicate on healthy life expectancy, which is the outcome of heath care. Imbalances can be noticed among the needs and the provided health care."

At 30°C in both packaging materials, change in moisture content, water activity (aw) and hardness were minimal while darkening of the surface color progressed. No microbial spoilage was found. Hedonic scores of color, flavor, taste, texture and overall acceptance of the 6th month aged samples were lowest (p≤0.05). Based on the sensory test, product packed in both packaging materials had shelf life of 5 months at 30°C. Higher storage temperature greatly induced time-dependent decrease in moisture content and aw with an increase in hardness, especially for the samples in PLA-based pouches. Fractional conversion model was used to predicted time-dependent change in total color difference (∆E) (R2 ≥ 0.84).

2-s2.0-85019180534,"We propose a new display system technology that can hide secret information behind a displayed image, while simultaneously satisfying both high invisibility and readability requirements. The hidden information is a kind of binary image including characters, and various kinds of patterns, i.e., quadratic residue (QR) codes. This technique uses a temporally bright modulated invisible pattern in a moving image, or video. Frame images over some periods are summed up when read out, enhancing the contrast of the invisible pattern to make it visible. We also propose a new method to solve an issue that occurs due to asynchronous operations of the display and video camera, which is a technique that was achieved by using time-shift sampling. The hidden binary image could be read out according to experiments that we conducted to confirm the results. Moreover, the patterns used in this technique were decidedly invisible when laid behind the main images, which suggested the proposed technique was highly feasible in practical applications according to this confirmation. © 2016 IEEE."

The in-situ production of hydroxyl radical as highly oxidizing agent conducted to the overall degradation of the nitramine explosives contained in the effluent samples. The kinetic abatement of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) followed the crescent order Fenton = photo-Fenton > electro-assisted Fenton process. The greater performance of the electro-assisted process is justified by the faster regeneration of Fe2+ from the electrochemical reduction and the oxidation contribution of the heterogeneous hydroxyl radical electrogenerated on the dimensional stable anode surface. On the other hand, similar DOC abatements of ca. 60% were attained after 2 h of treatment for all the technologies, being slightly superior for the photo-Fenton process due to the photodecarboxylation of carboxylate–iron complexes. The evaluation of the BOD5 and COD allowed considering the effluent biodegradability enhancement after Fenton's technologies treatment, being feasible their application prior to a biological treatment.

The results revealed that the ovary in this species was enclosed by the tunica albuginea. It was considered as an asynchronous type, which could be classified into seven stages based on its histological characteristics. These seven stages were oogonium, chromatin nucleolar, perinucleolar, oil droplet and cortical alveolar, early, late and post vitellogenic stages. During the oogenic processes, the change and characterization of inclusions including lipids, cortical alveoli and yolk granules were detected by histolochemical techniques. The ovarian histopathology in R brachysoma was detected. This includes ovarian degeneration, ovarian atrophy and atresia in different stages (oogonia, previtellogenic stages and vitellogenic stages) as well as melano-magcrophage centers. Atretic follicles and ovarian atrophy were also observed and could negatively affect the reproductive health of the species, which could lead to population declines in R. brachysoma as well as threaten other marine fishes connected through the food web in Thailand. © 2017, Prince of Songkla University.

Previous researches represent an evidence of a relationship between EO and firm performance. Nevertheless, there are limited studies to investigate both psychological and physical aspects of family business like EO and family business's resources and capabilities to firm performance. The empirical analysis includes a STEP project data set of 28 countries (n = 1,008) in 4 regions of the world; Asia-Oceania (Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Russia), Latin America (Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela), and North America (Canada, Mexico, USA) which was collected during 2013-2015. SEM is used to investigate the effect of EO and family business's resources and capabilities on marketing performances. The findings support the relationship of EO and family business's resources and capabilities on entrepreneurial performances. The results of the study show that both EO and family business's resources and capabilities affect positively to the entrepreneurial performance.

2-s2.0-85019097888,"Copper species with +1 oxidization state, Cu(I), in amorphous form can potentially be employed for photocatalytic activity improvement due to its ability to capture photoproduced hole. However, this proposition has never been confirmed experimentally, likely due to difficulty in forming such amorphous Cu(I) on the host photocatalyst surface. In the present work, Cu(I) amorphous nanoclusters are successfully deposited on the gC3N4 surface via ultrasonication without any external reducing agent for enhancement of visible light photocatalytic activity. Since Cu species are introduced in low concentrations and cannot be satisfactorily inspected using conventional characterization techniques, synchrotron-based techniques including XANES, EXAFS and soft-XAS are therefore used for interrogating the oxidation state and local structure of Cu(I) nanoclusters as well as the structural features of gC3N4. Appreciable enhancement of photocatalytic activity of Cu(I)/gC3N4 is shown for degradation and mineralization of atrazine under visible light. The Cu(I)/gC3N4 also exhibits relatively high adsorption capability for atrazine, which is up to 37% of total atrazine removal. These obtained results are very encouraging and may find applications in abatement of other recalcitrant organic contaminants combining adsorption and photocatalysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85019002592,"As Thailand is rapidly aging, understanding intergenerational relationships and how to mitigate intergenerational conflicts becomes an increasingly critical issue. Using a Structural Equation Modeling approach and a nationally representative dataset collected in 2011, this paper investigates how the Thai working-age population views the elderly. A unique feature of the paper is the construction of latent variables of ""positive"" and ""negative"" perceptions to capture intangible attitudes towards the elderly based on a Confirmatory Factor Analysis with modification indices. Drawing from the conflict perspective on aging, the paper finds that positive perception about the elderly among the working-age population is strongly correlated with age and income, but diminishes as the number of elderly individuals in the same household increases, while negative perception is neither affected by age nor contact with the elderly, yet it decreases with education and income. Interestingly, modernization diminishes both the positive and negative perceptions. In general the Thai working-age population has a favorable view about the elderly, but this study illustrates that there is still room for improvement. Progress towards the reduction of intergenerational conflicts can be made through an expansion of education and a stimulation of economic activities, which in turn generate income. The government should be more firmly committed to integrating aging issues into national school curricula, formally promoting an understanding across generations."

2-s2.0-85018981657,"The absorption and desorption of aqueous polyamine solutions with different number of amine groups (ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)) were determined for their equilibrium CO2 loading, initial absorption and desorption rates, heat duty for solvent regeneration, heat of CO2 absorption and pKa. The absorption was carried out at 313 K using 15% CO2 in N2 balance while desorption was performed at 363 K. The results showed that the equilibrium CO2 loading and the initial absorption rate were increased with increasing the number of amine groups because of the increase in the amine reactive sites for CO2 to form various species such as carbamate and dicarbamate at the equilibrium condition. The regeneration efficiency also increased with increasing number of amine groups because these caused an increase in the initial desorption rate and the decrease of heat duty. TEPA solution (2 mol/L) showed the best performance for all CO2 capture activities which are 2.12 molCO2/mol amine for the equilibrium CO2 loading, 0.74 × 10−2 molCO2/min for the initial absorption rate, 4.14 × 10−2 molCO2/min for the initial desorption rate, 41.13 kJ/mol for heat duty for solvent regeneration, and −70.18 kJ/mol for heat of absorption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85018990284,"This paper looks at the behaviors of female sex workers (FSW), male sex workers (MSW), clients seeking female sex workers (CFSW) and clients seeking male sex workers (CMSW) in the Thai commercial sex market under the conditions of imperfect information. We designed an experimental game model in which both the sex worker and their client do not know the health status of potential partners. The objectives of our model are to find the probabilities of all possible outcomes and to examine behavioral bias. The Nash equilibrium solution informs us that safe sex or sex with condoms is the rational strategy for those who are free from sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and for those who are risk averse, while sex without a condom is still possible for those who are infected and/or are risk lovers. In particular, we look at the possibility of behavioral bias when a client may offer significantly higher incentives for unprotected sex or sex without a condom usually in the form of a monetary offer or tip. The paper finds that the group of males who have sex with males (MSM), both clients and sex workers, are most likely to take risks. More specifically, in our experiment involving 200 sex workers and 67 clients, none of the CFSW show any willingness to negotiate for sex without condom, while 13.88% of the CMSW are still willing to negotiate for sex without condoms. Regarding the sex workers, there is a small probability that FSW may accept unprotected sex when offered a tip of Baht 5,000 or above, while more than 30% of the MSW report that they would accept unprotected sex when offered Baht 5,000 or more. Overall, this paper suggests that MSM, both clients (CMSW) and sex workers (MSW), may take greater risk by engaging in unprotected sex."

2-s2.0-85018718658,"Background: An important goal for dengue vaccines is to induce a high and durable level of neutralizing antibody. Objective: Three strategies were investigated for improving the immunogenicity of a prM+E dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) DNA vaccine: 1) expression in two different plasmids; 2) adjustment of dose; and, 3) introduction of the E sequence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) at the carboxy-terminal portion of DENV-2 E. Methods: Expression cassettes were designed to encode a full-length prM+E sequence of DENV-2 virus employing human-preferred codons (D2prMEopt), or a chimeric prM+E sequence in which the 100-residue carboxy-terminal region of E was derived from JEV (D2prMEJE20opt). pHIS and pCMVkan in the presence and absence of CpG motif, respectively, were used for cassette expression. The immunogenicity was compared in mice. Results: Three injections of full-length-D2prMEopt in pHIS and pCMVkan induced a comparable neutralizing antibody titer at post-week-2-injection and post-week-4-injection. The 100-μg DNA dose induced a numerically but not statistically higher neutralizing antibody titer than the 10-µg dose. The chimeric-D2prMEJE20opt produced higher extracellular prM and E protein levels in transfected Vero cells, but had a tendency to induce a lower neutralizing antibody titer in mice when compared with the full-length-D2prMEopt. To optimize the immunogenicity of D2prMEopt-DNA candidate, both expression plasmids can be used to generate reproducible high neutralizing titer. A higher dose of DNA immunogen may induce a higher neutralizing antibody response. Conclusion: The strategy of the C-terminal region chimeric counterpart with JE20 did not improve but may have reduced the induction of neutralizing antibodies. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

Objective: To study the changes in the pattern of contact sensitization and to identify risk factors associated with allergens. Method: The data of 206 patients who underwent patch testing at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during 2012 to 2015 were assessed. The associations between patient risk factors and positive reactions to each allergen were evaluated. The results were compared with data from 2003-2004. Results: The top five most common allergens during 2012-2015 were nickel sulfate (19.4%), methylchloroisothiazolinone/ methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) (13.6%), fragrance mix I (FM I) (10.7%), carba mix (9.2%) and cobalt chloride (6.3%) whereas, during 2003-2004, these were nickel sulfate, cobalt chloride, FM I, potassium dichromate and Myroxylon pereirae. A positive patch test to nickel was strongly associated with a history of metal and seafood allergy (p<0.001; OR, 4.94; 95% CI = 2.33-10.47 and p=0.028; OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.11-5.85, respectively). MCI/MI was correlated with a history of personal care products allergy, and fragrance was correlated with a history of urticaria (p=0.005; OR, 4.05; 95% CI = 1.54-10.66 and p=0.031; OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.10-6.68, respectively). Conclusions: There was an alteration in the pattern of contact sensitization detected by our standard series. MCI/MI has become the most common preservative causing contact allergy. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85018643426,"Problem: β-defensins are important innate chemical barriers that protect the endometrium from pathogen invasion. The effects of soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, on the expression and secretion of porcine β-defensins (PBD) in endometrial epithelial cells were investigated under normal or poly I:C-stimulated conditions. Method of study: Primary cultured porcine endometrial epithelial (PE) cells were pretreated with genistein or daidzein followed by poly I:C inoculation. During treatment, the culture media were analyzed for PBD 1-4 secretion by ELISA and the total RNA for PBD gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Porcine endometrial epithelial cells constitutively expressed PBD 1-4 and secreted PBD-1, PBD-2, and PBD-4. Genistein and daidzein enhanced PBD-2 expression and PBD-2 and PBD-3 secretion. These compounds also potentiated PBD-2 and PBD-3 expression and secretion which were upregulated by poly I:C. Conclusion: Soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, could be potentially used for promoting the innate host defense of endometrium against infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-85018693492,"Introduction: Structure, ultrastructural features and degeneration of oogenesis were first investigated in female Rastrelliger brachysoma as new candidate species for aquaculture by transmission electron microscopy. Materials and Methods: Specimens were naturally collected during the breeding season from Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand. Results: The ultrastructure of female oogenesis was principally divided into five stages based on the nuclear characterization and cytoplasmic organelles; (i) oogonium; (ii) previtellogenic; (iii) lipid and cortical alveolar; (iv) early and (v) late vitellogenic stages. Initially, oogonium was present within cell nest in the epithelial compartment. Its cell was supported by prefollicular cells. The multiple nucleoli in previtellogenic stage, referring to primary growth stage were the first to appear and they were scattered around the peripheral of nuclear membrane with the increasing number of cytoplasmic organelles. Some microvilli of granulosa cell initially protruded into the vitelline envelope. A simple layer of flattened granulosa and theca cells was also observed. The lipid and cortical alveolar stage under secondary growth oocyte was accumulated with two inclusions; the lipid droplets and cortical alveoli in the ooplasm. Another characterization, the increasing of numerous microvilli was also detected in the vitelline envelope. Finally, in the vitellogenic stage, a massive uptake and processing of proteins into yolk platelets due to embedding of the numerous microvilli in the largest vitelline envelope was observed. Oocyte degeneration in R. brachysoma was novel found especially oogonial and previtellogenic stages. Conclusion: Five oogenic stages of this fish are found with the changing of the arrangement of nucleus, cytoplasmic organelles and follicular complex, which will be applied to further studies. © 2017, Brazilian Society of Anatomy.

2-s2.0-85018748068,"Background and Objectives: This randomized trial compared ultrasound (US)- and fluoroscopy-guided sacral lateral branch (SLB) blocks. We hypothesized that US would require a shorter performance time. Methods: Forty patients who required unilateral sacral lateral branch blocks for chronic low back pain were randomized to US or fluoroscopy guidance. Before the performance of the assigned block, an investigator whowas not involved in patient care carried out baseline analgesic testing. With US, the dorsal sacroiliac ligament, the sacroiliac joint, and the interosseous ligament were probed with a 22-gauge block needle. The patient was asked to rate the level of discomfort using an 11-point numerical rating scale. After the analgesic test, attending anesthesiologists or supervised trainees carried out the SLB blocks. The local anesthetic agent (lidocaine 2%) was identical in all subjects. In the US group, local anesthetic (1.5 mL) was first injected on the lateral crest at the mid-point between S2 and S3. Subsequently, 2 more injections of 0.5 mL were carried out on the lateral crest, immediately cephalad to S2 and at the S1 level. In the fluoroscopy group, SLB blocks were performed according to a previously described 17-injection technique, which involves 9 skin entry sites and the targeting of the L5 posterior root and S1-S3 sacral lateral branches. A 0.4-mL volume of local anesthetic was deposited at each target point. The performance time, number of needle passes, and the incidence of vascular breach were recorded during the performance of the block. Twenty minutes after the end of local anesthetic injection, the same investigator who performed preblock analgesic testing carried out postblock testing in an identical manner. Results: Compared with fluoroscopy, the US technique was associated with a shorter performance time (267.5 ± 99.3 vs 628.7 ± 120.3 seconds; P < 0.001), fewer needle passes and a lower incidence of vascular breach (0 vs 10 occurrences; P = 0.001). However, the block effect (ie, the proportional decrease in numerical rating scale between preblock and postblock analgesic testing) was similar in both groups. Furthermore, no statistical differences were found in the proportions of patients achieving complete analgesia at each test site. The level of experience (ie, expert vs novice operator) significantly affected performance time with US but not with fluoroscopy. No procedural complications were recorded with either imaging modality during the 30-day follow-up period. Conclusions: Compared with their fluoroscopic counterparts, US-guided SLB blocks require a shorter performance time as well as fewer needle passes and carry a lower risk of vascular breach.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain HST01 was closely related to Haloarcula argentinensis JCM 9737T (99.7% similarities). On the basis of the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterizations including DNA–DNA relatedness (84.1-98.5%). It was identified as Haloarcula argentinensis JCM 9737T. The strain HST01 produced lipase (3.0 U/ml) in standard medium and the twofold increase of lipase activity was observed, 6.2 U/ml, in response to supplementation of palm oil in the basal medium. In addition, lipase production was evaluated (5.0 U/ml) in the presence of inexpensive and renewable lipase inducer, cooking palm oil. Therefore, strain HST01 might be used for the biotechnological applications such as food processing, environmental bioremediation and biosynthetic processing interesting for further studies. © 2017, Chiang Mai University.

2-s2.0-85018552144,"The influence of pipe diameters on shapes of an air Taylor bubble in stagnant water is numerically investigated under the conditions on which the Froude number varies with respect to the pipe diameter. Five pipe diameters between 0.0120 and 0.0160 m are selected to study so that the Froude number is a function of the pipe diameter. Since flows in the pipes have high Reynolds number, the k-ε model is employed to predict the behaviors of turbulent flows around a Taylor bubble. An appropriate Taylor bubble shape in each pipe is chosen by considering the pressure distribution of the air inside the bubble. The computational result shows that the Taylor bubble will be slenderer if the pipe diameter is increased owing to the influence of the Froude number. It is also found that all the Taylor bubble shapes in this study are slenderer than that created by Dumitrescu’s model. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved"

The effect of the PAN content wrapped around the multiwall CNTs in the range of 0-15 wt% on the activity and stability of the PtCo catalysts was explored. Increasing the PAN content on the CNT surface did not significantly affect the Pt : Co ratio and catalyst loading on the CNT surface, while it positively affected the electrode conductivity, crystallite size, average particle size and the electrochemical surface area (ESA) as well as the hydrophilic property of the PtCo catalyst. Among all the prepared PtCo catalysts, PtCo/10PAN-CNT exhibited the highest catalytic activity towards the ORR, with a kinetic current density of 36.9 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and a current density of 407 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V (244 mW cm−2) in a PEM fuel cell under a humidified H2/O2 environment at 60 °C and ambient pressure.

The PS-nTiO2 synthesized via in situ differential microemulsion polymerization displayed a core-shell morphology (nTiO2 core and PS shell) with an average diameter of 42 nm. The cure characteristics (scorch time, cure time, and cure rate index), mechanical properties (tensile properties, tear strength, and hardness), thermal stability, glass transition temperature, and morphology of the prepared nanocomposites were quantified and compared. The results showed that the cure characteristics of all the nanocomposites were not significantly changed compared to those of the neat NR/SBR blend. The inclusion of an appropriate amount of either nTiO2 or PS-nTiO2 into the NR/SBR blend apparently improved the tensile strength, modulus at 300% strain, tear strength, hardness, and thermal stability but deteriorated the elongation at break of the nanocomposites. Based on differential scanning calorimetry, the glass transition temperature of all the nanocomposites was similar to that of the neat NR/SBR blend. Moreover, the morphology of the PS-nTiO2-filled rubber nanocomposites fractured surface analyzed by scanning electron microscopy showed an improvement in the interfacial adhesion between the rubber phase and the nanoparticles. © 2017 Anyaporn Boonmahitthisud et al."

2-s2.0-85017658777,"The biomass gasification process is widely accepted as a popular technology to produce fuel for the application in gas turbines and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). Chemical reactions of this process can be separated into three reaction zones: pyrolysis, combustion, and reduction. In this study, sensitivity analysis with respect to three input parameters (gasification temperature, equivalence ratio, and steam-to-biomass ratio) has been carried out to achieve energy self-sufficient conditions in a steam gasification process under the criteria that the carbon conversion efficiency must be more than 70%, and carbon dioxide gas is lower than 20%. Simulation models of the steam gasification process have been carried out by ASPEN Plus and validated with both experimental data and simulation results from Nikoo & Mahinpey (2008). Gasification temperature of 911 °C, equivalence ratio of 0.18, and a steam-to-biomass ratio of 1.78, are considered as an optimal operation point to achieve energy self-sufficient condition. This operating point gives the maximum of carbon conversion efficiency at 91.03%, and carbon dioxide gas at 15.18 volumetric percentages. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is included to compare the environmental performance of conventional and energy self-sufficient gasification for steam biomass gasification. © 2017 by the authors.

2-s2.0-85018422089,"Background. Evidence supporting benefit of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in reducing mortality is not well-established. The effect of HCC surveillance in reducing mortality was assessed by an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)- based analysis controlled for inherent bias and confounders in observational studies. Material and methods. This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 446 patients diagnosed with HCC between 2007 and 2013 at a major referral center. Surveillance was defined as having at least 1 ultrasound test within a year before HCC diagnosis. Primary outcome was survival estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with lead-time bias adjustment and compared using the log-rank test. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using conventional Cox and weighted Cox proportional hazards analysis with IPTW adjustment. Results. Of the 446 patients, 103 (23.1%) were diagnosed with HCC through surveillance. The surveillance group had more patients with the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer stage A (80.6% vs. 33.8%, P < 0.0001), more patients eligible for potentially curative treatment (73.8% vs. 44.9%, P < 0.0001), and longer median survival (49.6 vs. 15.9 months, P < 0.0001). By conventional multivariate Cox analysis, HR (95% CI) of surveillance was 0.63 (0.45-0.87), P = 0.005. The estimated effect of surveillance remained similar in the IPTW-adjusted Cox analysis (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43-0.76, P < 0.001). Conclusions. HCC surveillance by ultrasound is associated with a 37% reduction in mortality. Even though surveillance is recommended in all guidelines, but in practice, it is underutilized.

2-s2.0-85017489547,"Oral supplements are commonly used in commercial herds to improve energy status and passive immune acquisition of newborn piglets. However, there is little scientific evidence on the efficacy of oral supplements for piglets. The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of 2 oral supplementation products on piglet pre-weaning mortality and growth. A total of 62 litters (749 piglets) were distributed according to the sow’s parity among 3 treatments: 1) CONTROL group, no oral supplementation to piglets; 2) EN group, light piglets (LP: birth BW ≤ 1.35 kg) received 2 doses of 1 mL Lianol Colostro; 3) COLO group, LP received 2 doses of 5 mL ColoBoost. Treatments were administered within 4 h after birth and repeated 8 h after the first dose. Piglets were weighed at d 0, 1, 10, and 21 after birth. Piglet rectal temperature was recorded shortly after birth and at 24 h. Cross-fostering was performed 24 h after birth. Blood samples were obtained from 39 LP at d 5 and 21 to determine IGF-I and IgG levels. Total mortality and LP mortality rate (percentage of LP in the litter that died) were recorded. At d 1, the EN group had a lower total mortality rate (2.1 vs. 7.1 ± 1.4%, P = 0.036) and LP mortality rate (4.5 vs. 11.1 ± 2.8%, P = 0.047) than the CONTROL group. At d 1, the COLO group tended to have a lower LP mortality rate than the CONTROL group (8.4 vs. 11.1 ± 3.0%, P = 0.058). After cross-fostering, the COLO group had a lower LP mortality rate at d 21 than the CONTROL group (6.3 vs. 18.3 ± 2.8%, P = 0.043). The total mortality rate and piglet body weight did not differ among groups at d 21. Piglets in the COLO group had a higher IgG level at d 5 than those in the EN group (24.9 vs. 16.3 ± 2.15 mg/mL, P = 0.034) and tended to be higher than those in the CONTROL group (24.9 vs. 17.7 ± 2.35 mg/mL, P = 0.072). Piglets in the EN group had a higher serum IGF-I concentration than those in the CONTROL group at d 21 (137.6 vs. 100.3 ± 11.15 ng/mL, P = 0.030). The results suggested that 2 doses of oral supplementation within 12 h after birth might be effective in increasing small piglet survival and improving their IGF-I or IgG levels during lactation without compromising litter growth. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

2-s2.0-85017422928,"Solvent-free dispersants for crude oil spills were formulated based on the hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) concept and using lipopeptides from Bacillus sp. GY19. The lipopeptides were recovered and concentrated from cell-free broth by foam fractionation and freeze-drying. They had good surface activity under varying temperatures, pH and NaCl levels. Moreover, the lipopeptides had low toxicity to copepods (LC50 1174 mg/L) and whiteleg shrimp (LC50 1050 mg/L). The characteristic curvature (Cc) of the lipopeptides showed that they were more hydrophobic (Cc 4.93) than sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate (SDHS, Cc −0.92). The HLD equation was used to calculate the lipopeptide and the SDHS fractions in the dispersant formulations according to the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of hydrocarbons and seawater salinity. The molar fraction of lipopeptides increased with increasing EACN. The lipopeptide-SDHS mixtures formed microemulsion Type III with specific hydrocarbons and crude oils. Oil displacement and baffled flask tests showed that the formulations reduced the interfacial tension and solubilized crude oil in the water column at higher efficiency than commercial dispersants or lipopeptides alone. In summary, the effectiveness of the lipopeptide-based dispersant corresponded to the optimal HLD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85018361444,"The objective of this paper is to assess how climate change adaptation funds have been legitimised; that is, how they have been justified and made acceptable to different actors. To this end, it analyses the way various actors have sought to promote and challenge the legitimacy often multi-lateral international and national climate change adaptation funds in the Asia-Pacific region. The study shows that adaptation funds draw on multiple sources of legitimacy, including: ethical or justice arguments; participation and deliberation; transparency; accountability; coherence; and effectiveness. Efforts to strengthen one source of legitimacy can have an impact on other sources, with evidence of both synergies and trade-offs. International and national adaptation funds are primarily legitimised to state actors, even though funds and projects are justified in terms of assisting vulnerable groups and communities. International financing has helped legitimise adaptation as an important development and policy objective. An adaptation financing architecture that is more multi-level, if not yet polycentric, has emerged alongside new legitimacy challenges; but at the same time, providing opportunities for improving outcomes on the ground if greater attention is given to access by vulnerable groups and communities.

The SOFC system includes units that require and generate heat; thus, its energy management is important to improve its efficiency. In this study, a SOFC-GT integrated system with the external steam reforming of ethanol to produce hydrogen for the SOFC is proposed. Two SOFC-GT hybrid systems using a high-temperature heat exchanger and cathode exhaust gas recirculation are considered under isothermal conditions. The effects of key operating parameters, such as pressure, fuel use and turbomachinery efficiency, on the SOFC-GT hybrid system performance are discussed. The simulation results indicate that recycling the cathode exhaust gas from the SOFC-GT system requires less fresh air from the compressor, to maintain the SOFC stack temperature, and the heat recovered from the SOFC system is sufficient to supply both the fuel processor and air pre-heater. In contrast, an external heat is needed for the SOFC-GT system coupled to a recuperative heat exchanger. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

2-s2.0-85017341285,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies have increased in importance recently due to high CO2 emission levels, principally from fossil fuel power generation to support increasing global energy demand. In this study, emergy accounting was applied to quantify the utilization of resources and compare process performance, in terms of sustainability, of three alternative CO2 capture technologies (chemical absorption, solid adsorption and membrane separation) selected from the representative literature. The natural investment or unit emergy value (UEV) of each process was evaluated in units of sej/kg. The results revealed that the lowest to highest UEVs were solid adsorption, membrane separation and amine absorption, respectively. Thus, the most preferable choice for CO2 capture among these three approaches was solid-based adsorption, since it consumed the lowest level of natural resources. Moreover, the UEV of the solid-based adsorption process can be lowered by improving and optimizing the heat utilization within the system and replacing the non-renewable sources of heat and power with renewable resources. In addition, the emergy analysis also provided suggestions for improving membrane separation and amine absorption processes. For amine absorption, improving solvent regeneration efficiency would reduce natural gas consumption, while for membrane separation, power sources should be switched to renewable resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Poly isobutylene alt maleic anhydride (PIAM) modified by sulfanilic acid is blended with polysulfone (PSf) in different concentrations. This induces surface charge and hydrophillicity in the otherwise hydrophobic PSf membranes. The so modified polymers and their blends are characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Blend membranes show drastically enhanced performance with respect to water flux, water uptake and ion exchange capacity. SEM micrographs indicate the hydrophilic domains, –SO3H groups in the polymer to have formed cavities during phase inversion process, thus enhancing permeability. 100% rejection of PEG 2000 and 59% of NaCl rejection substantiated the nature of the membrane to be nanofiltration (NF) type. The prepared membranes were further evaluated for Cr (VI) removal, with removal efficiency reaching above 92%. The electronic coupling that occurs between SO3H− and Na+ and the electrostatic interaction between metal ions and the charge on membrane facilitates NaCl and Cr (VI) rejection respectively. The study gains significance in use of such modified PIAM as blend material with any other polymer to enhance the native properties of the blend membrane. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85017668271,"BACKGROUND Between 2000 and 2010, the labor force participation of European men stayed mostly constant, whereas the participation of women continued to increase. Participation rates of people close to normal retirement ages rose almost universally. At the same time, the education composition shifted toward higher levels of educational attainment and education-specific differentials in economic activity persisted. OBJECTIVE The aim of the paper is to understand the extent to which developments of labor force participation rates between 2000 and 2010 in selected European countries can be explained by age-specific and education-specific changes in participation rates, as compared to changes in populations' structural composition by age and education. METHODS We apply a decomposition methodology that allows us to disentangle changes in age- and education-specific labor force participation rates from changes in the age and educational structure of the population. RESULTS Our results show that labor force participation rates of adult women would have increased even more, had it not been for the downward pressure from the shift in the age composition toward older age groups with relatively lower levels of participation. This downward pressure also depressed male participation. The increase in participation among older people is mainly explained by participation increases among those with non tertiary education and is reinforced by a general shift toward higher levels of educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS Beyond changes in the age structure, we quantify the role of compositional changes by educational attainment. Our results indicate that labor supply may not decrease to the extent expected due to population aging, given educational expansion and educationspecific patterns of economic activity. © 2017 Elke Loichinger & Alexia Prskawetz."

Compared with the Pt/C catalyst, the heat-treatment induced the formation of a more crystallite PtM structure and an agglomeration of Pt particles in all PtM catalysts, resulting in a decreased electrochemical surface area (ESA). Besides, the heat-treatment increased the electrical conductivity, which consequently affected the ORR activity and stability of the PtM/C catalyst. Among all prepared PtM/C catalysts, the PtCo/C catalyst exhibited the highest ORR activity, with a current density of around 392.8 mA/cm2 (235.7 mW/cm2) at 0.6 V under a H2/air environment at 60 °C and ambient pressure with the ESA loss of 58.7% after 500 cycles of cyclic voltamogram (CV).

Oxidative stress imposed by H2O2 treatment decreased the biomass of both the wild type and the mutant. The H2O2 treated mutant when grown in BG11 medium showed an increase in biomass which was in contrast to a decreased biomass observed in the H2O2 treated wild type. A 3-fold increase in lipid yield of 1.63 g/L was obtained in the oxidative stress-induced mutant compared to the wild type.

To achieve the goal, a mathematical model for predicting blood-cell motion was developed and validated using magnetic particles. In the experiments, trajectories of magnetic particles were captured using a photographic technique as the particles moved inside the system. The study has revealed that the trajectories of the magnetic particles obtained from both computational and experimental results were in a good agreement, and the mean deviation between them was around 18% for both 5 and 10 μm magnetic particles. In addition, the simulation results for malaria-infected mouse blood cells suggested that at the distance of 400 μm from the magnet array, the infected blood cells could move laterally toward the magnet array at distances around 35.2, 26.9, 21.8, and 18.3 μm within a 3 cm downstream distance at flow rates of 0.18, 0.23, 0.28, and 0.33 μL/min, respectively. © MYU K.K."
2-s2.0-85016621673,"Parallel assembly lines (PALs) typify a production facility comprising of two or more straight assembly lines arranged in parallel to assemble similar products or different models of the same product. The configuration of PALs poses new challenges for the optimal design of the lines since the efficacy of the assembly system can be improved by combining stations of adjacent lines when balancing them. As a consequence, the multi-objective mixed-model parallel assembly line balancing problem is addressed in this paper. The hierarchical objectives to be optimised include: 1) minimising number of workstations; 2) minimising number of stations; 3) simultaneously minimising workload variation and maximising work-relatedness. The fuzzy BBO (F-BBO) algorithm is developed to tackle this problem and its performances are evaluated against several well-known algorithms under different instances of benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the solution quality of the proposed F-BBO is significantly better than the contestant algorithms. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
2-s2.0-85016492874,"Objective: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of tedizolid against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by time-kill curve experiments. Materials and Methods: Four bacterial strains were used in methicillin susceptibility tests including MRSA strain H0340, H5086, H6023, and H7515, obtained from Department of Microbiology at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by macrodilution method. Results: The time-kill curves were conducted using H5086 strain, showing the highest MIC of 0.25 μg/ml. The time-kill studies also showed that tedizolid exhibited bacteriostatic activity at all concentrations (from 0.25× to 16× MIC) with a reduction in growth of <3 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml. Furthermore, the compound appeared to have a maximum effect at the concentration of 8× MIC with 1.8 log10 CFU/ml reduction from the initial inoculum at 12 h. Conclusion: Tedizolid is potentially a good antimicrobial activity for MRSA with bacteriostatic activity. © 2017, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85016559347,"Bovine endometritis is one of the most common reproductive diseases and causes important economic losses. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Binding of LPS and TLR4 mediates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This study aimed to access the effect of TLR4 antagonist (RsLPS) on the immune responses of bovine endometrial cells. Primary culture of bovine endometrial cells were challenged with LPS (100 ng/ml) after treated with and without RsLPS (5000 ng/ml). Endometrial cells without RsLPS and LPS treatment served as control. The mRNA expression of TLR4, CD14, TNF, IL1B and IL8 were investigated by using qPCR. The secretory protein of IL8 was measured by using ELISA. As expected, LPS up-regulated the mRNA expression of TNF, IL1B, IL8 and the secretion of IL8 (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, endometrial cells pre-treated with RsLPS, after challenging with LPS showed an increased mRNA expression of all candidate genes (p < 0.05) except only CD14 compared to control group. Interestingly, the secretion of IL8 was significantly decreased in LPS challenged endometrial cells pre-treated with RsLPS (p < 0.01) compared to LPS treatment group. Our findings suggested that RsLPS may act as antagonist for TLR4 in bovine endometrial cells. Nevertheless, other signaling pathways may involve with the link between innate immune responses and TLR4 antagonist. Therefore, the signaling mechanisms of RsLPS that related to the expression of proinflammatory mediators should be further investigated."

2-s2.0-85016604913,"Malignant cells require a large amount of iron for cell growth. Transferrin transfers iron from blood to cells by reacting with transferrin receptor (TfR). In humans, transferrin and transferrin receptor correlate with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); however, the association with canine oral tumor has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate saliva and serum transferrin and tissue transferrin receptor in canine OSCC and oral melanoma (OM). Saliva and serum transferrin samples were collected pre- and 14 days post-operation, compared with healthy control and evaluated by a sandwich ELISA assay. Serum transferrin concentration in the experimental group both before and after surgery was significantly lower than that in the normal group (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference in serum transferrin levels before and after surgery was observed. Saliva transferrin expression of the dogs with oronasal cancer before surgical treatment tended to be higher than that of the control group. In contrast, at post-operation, they were not significantly different. Dogs with clinical stage I oronasal cancer revealed the highest saliva transferrin level as in humans. In addition, transferrin receptor expression, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, in the dogs with oronasal cancer was higher than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The decrease in serum transferrin was probably due to the uptake of transferrin bound iron by cancer cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the new role of transferrin and its receptor for iron acquisition in canine OSCC and OM."
2-s2.0-85016399497,"The effect of the Molybdenum (Mo) content on the heat treatment behavior of multi-alloyed white cast iron was investigated. The cast iron with varying Mo contents from 0.12 to 7.66% under the basic alloy composition of 5% Cr, W and V each was prepared. After annealing at 1223 K for 18 ks, the test specimens were austenitized at 1373 K for 3.6 ks in a vacuum furnace and subsequently hardened by a jet-spray of liquid nitrogen. The tempering was carried out at temperatures from 673 to 873 K at 50 K intervals for 12 ks. It was found that the hardness in the as-hardened state was increased progressively with an increase in the Mo content. The volume fraction of the retained austenite (Vγ) decreased markedly when the Mo content was increased over 1.17%. In the tempered state, the hardness curve showed clear secondary hardening due to the precipitation of one secondary carbides and a reduction of the Vγ. The Vγ value in each specimen decreased gradually as the tempering temperature was elevated, but reduced greatly when tempered at 748 to 823 K. The maximum tempered hardness (HTmax) was obtained in the specimen tempered at 798 K where the Vγ was less than 10%. The HTmax increased first, and then subsequently decreased with an increase in the Mo content. The highest HTmax value, 946 HV30, was obtained in the specimen with 4.98%Mo. It was found that the 15-37%Vγ in the as-hardened state was necessary to get the hardness over 900 HV30 by tempering. The degree of secondary hardening (Hs) increased as the Mo content rose from 0.12 to 4.98% where the difference between the Vγ in the as-hardened state and that at HTmax (δVγ) was 22-23%. © 2017 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials."

2-s2.0-85016473894,"The possibility of converting cellulose into lactic acid using stable, easily prepared solid catalysts has attracted much attention. In this study, the catalytic activities of various transition metal oxides for cellulose conversion were determined; ZrO2 showed the highest activity for lactic acid production from cellulose. Various types of ZrO2 were tested for catalytic activity. The correlation between lactic acid yields and the characteristic properties of the ZrO2 indicated that the concentrations of acid and base sites on the ZrO2 played an important role in lactic acid production. The conversion of fructose into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone by a retro-aldol reaction was probably enhanced by the combination of acid and base sites on the ZrO2. The ZrO2 catalyst was stable in high-temperature water (473 K), and almost no Zr leached out of the catalyst into solution during the reaction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry."

A cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire to determine HCWs' histories of chickenpox or 2-dose varicella vaccination was conducted. From a total of 699 HCWs, 653 HCWs (93z), including 145 physicians (22z), 297 nurses (46z), and 211 administrative staff (32z), responded to questionnaires. There were 475 HCWs (73z) who had a history of chickenpox, 58 (9z) who had completed the 2-dose varicella vaccine schedule, and 120 (18z) whose varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity status was uncertain. In total, 107 HCWs (89z) were tested for VZV IgG, 90 of whom had immunity, and 17 were determined to be non-immune. After combining history and VZV IgG test results, the prevalence of non-immune HCWs was 2.6z (95zCI 1.4–3.8), with those ≤40 years of age at higher risk of nonimmunity. Implementing a strategy that involves testing of only those with an unknown VZV status and vaccination for only those determined to be non-immune costs 1,801 United States dollar (USD), less than the total cost (4,601 USD) for vaccinating all HCWs with uncertain status. © 2017, National Institute of Health.

At similar solid content, Tg decreased as HSH concentration increased. Tg data at different solid contents were well-fitted with Gordon-Taylor equation (R2≥0.97). Adsorption isotherm showed that systems with greater HSH concentration became more hygroscopic. Accelerated storage test (30°C, 84% RH) of modeled hard candy containing 10% HSH and pure isomalt formula was done. HSH enhanced water uptake and crystallization of polyols in hard candy during aging without packaging; however, those effects were lessen for the samples aged in polyethylene terephthalate/cast polypropylene (PET/CPP) pouches, and were negligible after the application of superior moisture barrier, oriented polypropylene/metalized cast polypropylene (OPP/MCPP) film.

2-s2.0-85016194272,"Anatomical and histological structures of the tongue tissue of Rastrelliger brachysoma and R. kanagurta were investigated. Anatomical structure of the tongue in R. brachysoma was poorly developed and was of triangular shape. The histological and histochemical technique showed the tissue to be principally composed of three layers: tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa and osteocartilagionous skeleton. Stratified epithelium of its mucosal surface was interrupted with several cell types including goblet cells and taste buds. Numerous teeth with elongated shape were also found centrally on the anterior tip of the tongue. They are found among a few dermal papillae of the tongue. Tunica submucosa consisted of connective tissue, blood vessels and pigment cells. When compared anatomically and histologically with that of R. kanagurta, the overall morphological was quite similar. However, some histological structures including taste buds and teeth of R. kanagurta were rarely seen. Rastrelliger kanagurta also tended to have more goblet cell than R. brachysoma. Rastrelliger kanagurta tended to possess less overall histological structures of the tongue. This difference could potentially cause by different feeding adaptation between the two species. Regardless of the differences found between the two species, both are still considered as herbivores. © 2017, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved."

Persistent HPV infection can result in cervical, vulvovaginal, penile and anogenital cancer. Clinical studies have shown the efficacy of three doses of quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccination, at Day 0, Month 2 and Month 6, to lower the occurrence of HPV infection and its complications. However, immunogenicity and safety of the HPV vaccine have not been proven in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Methods. Sixty CKD stage IV, V and VD patients were enrolled for quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination. A dose of vaccine was given at Day 0, Month 2 and Month 6. Each dose contained 20 lg HPV-6 L1 VLP, 40 lg HPV-11 L1 VLP, 40 lg HPV-16 L1 VLP and 20 lg HPV-18 L1 VLP, along with 225 lg of amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant. HPV type-specific antibody response to neutralizing epitopes on HPV-6/11/16/18 was performed by multiplexed, competitive LuminexVR immunoassays (cLIA) at Day 0 andMonth 7. Results. At Day 0, anti-HPV seropositivity was 0-6.6% depending on HPV genotype. Patients who received three doses of vaccine had 98.2, 100, 100 and 98.2% seropositivity for genotypes 6/11/16/18, respectively. The average cLIA atMonth 7 for genotypes 6/11/16/18 were 928.4 6 231.1, 1136.1 6 264.6, 6951.0 6 1872.3 and 2196.3 6 761.2 milliMerck units (mMu)/mL, respectively.

2-s2.0-85015916433,"Purpose: Worldwide interest in principal instructional leadership has led to global dissemination of related research findings despite their concentration in a limited set of western cultural contexts. An urgent challenge in educational leadership and management lies in expanding the range of national settings for investigations of instructional leadership. The current study addressed this challenge in the context of Vietnam, a nation with a very limited formal knowledge base in school leadership (Hallinger and Bryant, 2013b; Hallinger and Truong, 2014). The purpose of this paper is to describe the perspectives of Vietnamese primary school principals toward their role as instructional leaders, illuminate instructional leadership practices perceived as important by the principals, and develop a preliminary model of instructional leadership within the Vietnamese education context. Design/methodology/approach: This study was a qualitative inquiry that sought to illuminate the perspectives of Vietnamese principals toward their role as instructional leaders. The research employed semi-structured interviews with 27 primary school principals. Data analysis employed grounded theory in order to synthesize results gathered from the principals into a preliminary conceptual model. Findings: The study yielded a preliminary model of principal instructional leadership in Vietnam. The authors’ model evidences similarities to western models of instructional leadership by including dimensions focusing on setting direction, managing curriculum and instruction and developing the school learning climate. Differences also emerged in terms of two additional constructs, building solidarity and managing external relationships. Other distinctive practices of Vietnamese instructional leaders also emerged in the findings which the authors suggest can be linked to the institutional, political and socio-cultural context of education in this society. Research limitations/implications: Key limitations arise from the focus on primary schools, small size of the sample, absence of data from the Northern region of Vietnam, and lack of verification of principals’ perspectives with data from other stakeholders. Originality/value: This study is one of the first empirical studies of Vietnamese school leadership submitted for publication in international refereed journals and the first study that has that sought to conceptualize the instructional leadership role of principals in Vietnam. Moreover, the study illustrates how conceptualizations of school leadership are shaped by features of specific societies. This lends credence to scholarly admonitions concerning the lack of universality of leadership theories. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

The content of lawsone in L. inermis leaves by TLC-densitometry was found to be 0.76 ± 0.05 g/100 g of dried crude drug, whereas the lawsone content evaluation by TLC image analysis was found to be 0.87 ± 0.11 g/100 g of dried crude drug. The validation of the methods revealed that both TLC-densitometry and TLC image analysis showed a good sensitivity and accuracy for lawsone quantitation in L. inermis. Conclusion: The pharmacognostic specifications could be used as the standardization data of L. inermis leaves, and the development of TLC method could be applied to determine lawsone content in this plant material. © 2017 Pharmacognosy Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow."

2-s2.0-85015698932,"In this work, hindered primary, secondary and tertiary aqueous alkanolamine solutions with different numbers of hydroxyl groups were investigated for their initial rates of absorption and desorption which show how fast the amine solution will reach equilibrium and will be regenerated, respectively, and also investigated pKa, equilibrium solubility of CO2, heat duty (Qreg) for solvent regeneration, and heat of CO2 absorption (ΔHabs). These experimental data were used as a screening tool to enable the selection of the best amine components for designing an optimal blended aqueous amine solution system. The absorption experiments were performed at 313 K and atmospheric pressure using 15% CO2 (in N2 balance) as feed gas whereas desorption experiments were performed at 363 K and atmospheric pressure. Alkanolamines with a larger number of hydroxyl groups exhibited lower performance in all the CO2 capture activities because of the negative electron withdrawing effect of the hydroxyl group. Consequently, based on the results of individual primary, secondary, and tertiary aqueous alkanolamine solutions, the ones with only one hydroxyl group (2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), 2-(ethylamino) ethanol (EAE), and 2-(dimethylaminoethanol) (DMAE)) were selected for formulation into aqueous amine blends. Two binary aqueous amine blends of AMP/DMAE and EAE/DMAE and one ternary aqueous amine blend of AMP/EAE/DMAE at various molar ratios were tested. All solvent combinations showed better performance than 5 M MEA, especially in the initial desorption rate and energy efficiency. Of these aqueous amine blends, the 2.5 M AMP/2.5 M DMAE exhibited the best performance with an equilibrium CO2 solubility of 0.56 mol CO2/mol amine, initial absorption rate of 0.26 × 10−2 mol CO2/min, initial desorption rate of 2.62 × 10−2 mol CO2/min, and heat duty of 53.81 kJ/mol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85015417452,"Biomass is one of the most promising energy sources for hydrogen production. However, biomass gasification has a low hydrogen content in the producer gas. To increase the hydrogen yield, the co-feeding of methane into biomass gasification is proposed in this study. The type of gasifying agent is a key factor in the determination of the content of the hydrogen product. To compare the designs and find the best performance criteria of a process, not only energy and exergy analyses but also a cost analysis of the process should be investigated. In the present study, the effects of various types of gasifying agent, i.e., air and both steam and air, for the biomass gasification with/without methane co-feeding are investigated through an exergoeconomic analysis. It is observed that the air-steam used as an agent achieves high energy and exergy efficiency. Methane co-feeding can improve the energy and exergy efficiency. In exergoeconomic analysis, the specific exergy cost (SPECO) method is applied to investigate the unit cost of hydrogen. The economic reveal that the biomass gasification using air-steam as an agent with methane co-feeding also presented the lowest unit hydrogen cost of 2.69 $/kg. The unit exergy cost of hydrogen is 0.068 $/kW h. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85015441925,"A simple, rapid, and environmentally friendly process using hydrogen peroxide, was developed for recovering high purity silver directly from industry and laboratory wastes. Silver ammine complex, [Ag(NH3)2]+Cl−, derived from AgCl were generated and then directly reduced using H2O2 to reliably turn into high purity microcrystalline silver (99.99%) examined by EDS and XRD. Morphology of the recovered silver microcrystals could be selectively tuned by an addition of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). The main parameters in the recovering process including pH, concentration of Ag+ and the mole ratio of H2O2:Ag+ were carefully optimized though the central composite design (CCD). The optimized condition was employed for a trial recovery of 50 L silver ammine complex prepared from a collection of silver-wastes during 3-year research on industrial nanoparticle production. The recovered silver microcrystals >700 g could be recovered with 91.27%. The remaining solution after filtering of the recovered silver microcrystals can be used repeatedly (at least 8 cycles) without losing recovery efficiency. Matrix interferences including Pb2+ and Cl− play a minimal role in our silver recovery process. Furthermore, the direct usage of the recovered silver microcrystals was demonstrated by using as a raw material of silver clay for creating a set of wearable silver jewelries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85015367750,"Background and Objective: Males and females who use methamphetamine (MA) differ in sociodemographics, MA diagnoses, comorbidities, and brain activity. The objective of this study was to investigate sex differences in the characteristics of MA use and dependence in patients at a Thai substance treatment center. Methods: Demographic, MA use, and diagnostic data for 782 MA users were obtained by using the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism-Thai version. Categorical comparisons of males (n=413, 53%) and females (n=369, 47%) were made by chi-square test. Factors significantly differentiating men and women with respect to MA-dependence were identified by logistic regression analysis controlling for demographic, diagnostic, and MA use variables. Results: Males admitted to residential drug treatment for MA use had an earlier age of onset for both MA use (17.7=±=4.1 vs 19.7=±=6.2 years; t=-5.3, P=<=0.001) and dependence (20.4=±=5.2 vs 22.2=±=6.4 years; t=-3.6, P=<=0.001). Females were more likely than males to be MA-dependent (79% vs 60%; χ2 1 =33.7, P=<=0.001), and to experience MA withdrawal (65.3% vs 48.9%; χ2 1 =21.4, P=<=0.001), withdrawal-related hypersomnia (77.2% vs 64.8%; χ2 1 =14.5, P=<=0.001), fatigue (77.5% vs 70.3%; χ2 1 =5.2, P=0.02), and psychomotor retardation (64.5% vs 57.0%; χ2 1 =4.5, P=0.03). Similarly, females had heavier (eg, largest daily amount [χ2 1 =12.4, P=<=0.001), more frequent (χ2 1 =5.1, P=0.02]) and greater lifetime episodes of MA use (χ2 1 =24.1, P=<=0.001) than males. After controlling for such variables by logistic regression, being female remained a significant factor influencing the occurrence of MA-dependence (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-4.1, P=<=0.001). Shared associated factors (or comorbidities) for MA-dependence in both sexes included nicotine dependence (in males: OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.0, P=<=0.001; and in females: OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4, P=0.007), greater lifetime episodes of MA use (in males: OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.9-6.4, P=<=0.001; and in females: OR 5.9, 95% CI 3.1-11.4, P=<=0.001), and more frequent use (in males: OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.8-9.1, P=<=0.001; and in females: OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-6.9, P=<=0.001). Comorbid antisocial personality disorder predicted MA-dependence in males only (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.6, P=0.002).

Pineapple juice was primary fermented with a mixed yeast of Saccharomycodes ludwigii S1 and Hanseniaspora uvarum TISTR5153 at 25-30°C for 7 d and then secondary LAB fermented with Oenococcus oeni LALVIN 31TM and/or O. oeni Enoferm® ALPHA at 25-30°C for 4 weeks. Optimal secondary fermentation was found in the co-presence of both LAB, which decreased the malic acid content to 5.58 g/L forming lactic acid (4.39 g/L). The secondary ferment still contained 10% (v/v) alcohol but had a higher TTA (10.6 g/L) and pH (3.80). The sensory score of the wine after fermentation with both LAB isolates was increased and this was higher than when fermented with either LAB alone. Thus, secondary fermentation of pineapple wine using O. oeni could significantly improve the wine quality. © All Rights Reserved."
2-s2.0-85015680272,"This paper presents the analysis of a layered elastic half space under the action of axisymmetric surface loading and the influence of the surface energy effects. The boundary value problems for the bulk and the surface are formulated based on classical linear elasticity and a complete Gurtin-Murdoch constitutive relation. An analytical technique using Love's representation and the Hankel integral transform is employed to derive an integral-form solution for both displacement and stress fields. An efficient numerical quadrature is then applied to accurately evaluate all involved integrals. Selected numerical results are presented to portray the influence of various parameters on elastic fields. Numerical results indicate that the surface stress displays a significant influence on both displacement and stress fields. It is also found that the layered half space becomes stiffer with the presence of surface stresses. In addition, unlike the classical elasticity solution, size-dependent behavior of elastic fields is noted. The present analytical solutions provide fundamental understanding of the influence of surface energy on layered elastic materials. It can also be used as a benchmark solution for the development of numerical techniques such as FEM and BEM, for analysis of more complex problems involving a layered medium under the influence of surface energy effects. © 2017 Supakorn Tirapat et al."

This video call technology is different from old technology and the technology acceptance has changed users’ behavior in society, culture, and especially attitude toward using new technology. This research studied the intention and the need to use video call via smartphone by blind people according to the Technology Acceptance Model, a famous and widely-accepted theory for the indication of the intention to use technology. The survey data collected from a sample of 30 blind people who lived in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and used smartphones in their daily life were analyzed using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The results found the perceived ease of use factor and the perceived usefulness factor have similar direction and relation. These two factors also have similar roles and relation to the attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use video call via smartphone in the daily life of blind people. The group of blind people who had not experienced using video call via smartphone had similar direction and relation in technology acceptance at a higher level than the group of blind people who had experienced except for the relation between the attitude toward using factor and the behavioral intention to use factor. © 2017 Kasetsart University"
2-s2.0-85015233826,"HIV-1-infected cells presenting envelope glycoproteins (Env) in the CD4-bound conformation on their surface are preferentially targeted by antibodydependent cellular-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). HIV-1 has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to avoid the exposure of Env ADCC epitopes by downregulating CD4 and by limiting the overall amount of Env on the cell surface. In HIV-1, substitution of large residues such as histidine or tryptophan for serine 375 (S375H/W) in the gp120 Phe 43 cavity, where Phe 43 of CD4 contacts gp120, results in the spontaneous sampling of an Env conformation closer to the CD4-bound state. While residue S375 is well conserved in the majority of group M HIV-1 isolates, CRF01_ AE strains have a naturally occurring histidine at this position (H375). Interestingly, CRF01_AE is the predominant circulating strain in Thailand, where the RV144 trial took place. In this trial, which resulted in a modest degree of protection, ADCC responses were identified as being part of the correlate of protection. Here we investigate the influence of the Phe 43 cavity on ADCC responses. Filling this cavity with a histidine or tryptophan residue in Env with a natural serine residue at this position (S375H/W) increased the susceptibility of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC. Conversely, the replacement of His 375 by a serine residue (H375S) within HIV-1 CRF01_AE decreased the efficiency of the ADCC response. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that the presence of His 375 in the circulating strain where the RV144 trial was held contributed to the observed vaccine efficacy. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

There have been a few studies which have demonstrated maternal serum vitamin D to be associated with preterm labor. The objective was to evaluate the serum vitamin D concentrations in Thai pregnant women with and without preterm labor and to find the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in both groups. Methods and Study Design: Blood samples were collected from pregnant women with and without preterm labor (matched for gestational age). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence method. Results: A total of 60 pregnant women were included into the study, 30 patients in the preterm labor group and another 30 patients in the control group. The serum 25-OHD concentration was 21.0 ± 7.5 ng/mL and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 48.3% in total group of pregnant women. The serum 25- OHD concentrations were not different between the preterm labor and the control groups (20.9±8.4 vs 21.2±6.7 ng/mL, p = 0.91). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were not different between the preterm labor and the control groups (53.3% vs 43.3%, p = 0.44 and 83.3% vs 90%, p = 0.45, respectively). Conclusion: The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were not different between the preterm labor and the control groups.

2-s2.0-85015405181,"A number of features of business discourse in English in a Thai workplace, for example, in e-mail memos, are integral to modern business operations. In this study, a questionnaire was used to find the important situations in which English is used in business communication. For this purpose, Thai businesses were requested to provide samples of written business correspondence—mostly e-mails in English. These e-mails were examined using genre analysis to identify typical moves and steps in order to understand the use of English at the linguistic and discourse levels. Genre can be defined as a class of communicative events, with the members sharing some set of communicative purposes. Interviews were also conducted to gather data in order to describe in-depth, the nature of English language communication and possible problems arising in a Thai business context. The findings showed that despite a large number of errors in usage in the English samples, they rarely caused problems with the running of the business as Thai communicators employed a move/step structure in their e-mails and other communications strategies including follow-up inquiries for clarification.

Based on energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry images, an MWCNT-Ag was successfully synthesized. The effect of the MWCNT-Ag on the PLA bionanocomposites was investigated by evaluating their thermal and mechanical properties, antifungal activity, and cytotoxicity. The nanocomposites exhibited a high degree of biocompatibility with the MWCNT-Ag content, which was less than 0.3 phr. Furthermore, tensile strength testing, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and antibacterial evaluation revealed that the tensile strength, thermostability, glass transition temperature, and antibacterial properties were enhanced by increasing the MWCNT-Ag content. Finally, hydrolysis analysis indicated that the low MWCNT-Ag content could increase the packing density of PLA. © 2017 by the authors."

In this study, a series of avicequinone C analogues containing furanonaphthoquinone with different degrees of saturation and substituents at the furan ring were synthesized. The resulting synthetic avicequinone C and analogues (5a-f) along with some related compounds including 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (6) and natural naphthoquinones such as lawsone (7a) and lapachol (7b) were evaluated for their in vitro cell viability and steroid 5α-reductase type 1 inhibitory activities using the cultured cell line of human keratinocytes (HaCaT). This cell-based bioassay was performed based on a direct detection of the enzymatic product dihydrotestosterone (2) by using a non-radioactive high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method. Among the furanonaphthoquinones in this series, 5e having a propionic substituent at furan ring possessed approximately 22-fold more potent than the original isolated compound 5a.

2-s2.0-85014438440,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential use of the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly as an intumescent flame retardant for polyester, cotton and their blended fabrics. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, polyester (PET), cotton and their blends were applied with the flame retardant coating via the LbL assembly technique. The flame retardancy, melt dripping, thermal properties and morphology of coated polyester fabrics were then examined. Findings: The scanning electron micrograph of uncoated and coated fabrics revealed that the LbL assembly coating on the fabric surface was successful. The assessment of the flame retardancy and thermal properties of the coated fabrics showed that the after-flame time and melt dripping during the vertical burning test decreased. The char residue at temperatures ranging from 450 to 800°C during thermogravimetric analysis was enhanced as compared with the uncoated fabric. Furthermore, the morphology of the char residual of coated fabrics was rougher and bulkier than the uncoated fabrics, suggesting the typical behavior of intumescence. Social implications: The LbL technique generally uses much fewer chemicals, thus making this flame retardant finishing much more environmentally friendly. It is also expected that these fabrics will show better touch characteristics. These fabrics may be tested for their comfort compared to that of conventional coating to enable their use on an industrial scale.

The amount of PFAD 5, 8, 12, and 25 wt% of PFAD in LGO was the feed mixtures. High conversion range on both desulfurization and deoxygenation reactions were achieved by every fraction of PFAD. The hydrocarbon products contained sulfur lower than 50 ppmw and neutralization number lower than 0.1 mg KOH/g. These products can be claimed as EURO 4 diesel following EN 590. The presence of PFAD in LGO improved the cetane index of the liquid products while lowered the product density. Highly heat effect was observed by an increasing of the reactor temperature up to 62 °C at the reactor outlet in the case of 25 wt% of PFAD. The increasing of the reactor temperature was resulting from an increasing amount of PFAD in LGO. The higher amount of PFAD slightly facilitated deoxygenation reaction, but impeded hydrodesulfurization reaction. The temperature rise also increased hydrocracking reaction evidenced by the lower contribution of total n-paraffin to the product mixture at higher PFAD in LGO. Finally, the hydrogen consumption was observed as linearly increased with an increasing amount of PFAD. The consumption was then theoretically calculated and extrapolated for hydrotreating of pure PFAD at 300 and 344 Nm3/m3, respectively. An additional hydrogen consumption of 44 Nm3/m3 was studied and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The enhanced production of IL-1Ra was further confirmed in PRRSV-cultured PBMC and PRRSV-exposed pigs by flow cytometry. Myeloid cell population appeared to be the major IL-1Ra producer both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to the type 2 PRRSV, the highly pathogenic (HP)PRRSV did not upregulate IL1RA gene expression in vitro. To determine the kinetics of PRRSV-induced IL1RA gene expression in relation to other pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, PRRSV-negative pigs were vaccinated with a commercially available type 2 modified-live PRRS vaccine or intranasally inoculated with HP-PRRSV. In modified-live PRRS vaccine pigs, upregulation of IL1RA, but not IL1B and IFNA, gene expression was observed from 2 days postvaccination. Consistent with the in vitro findings, upregulation of IL1RA gene expression was not observed in the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs throughout the experiment. This study identified IL-1Ra as an early immunomodulatory mediator that could be involved in the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV infections. © 2017 The Authors."
2-s2.0-85014089683,"This study aimed to investigate the spread of methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (MRCoPS) among veterinary staff, hand-touch sites and surgical tissue during cystotomy operations on cats and dogs that were patients, and to analyze the genetic relatedness and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates. Human and environmental samples were obtained from the nasal passageways of 12 surgeons and veterinary assistants and from 29 hand-touch sites of instruments in operative units and subjected to bacterial isolation and enumeration. Swab samples were collected in triplicate from 29 dogs and three cats at the site of incision, from the incision area, from the peritoneum during surgery and from the peritoneum before suture. MRCoPS were identified by mecA gene detection and characterized by their antibiogram profile, SCCmec type and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Twenty-four staphylococci were isolated, derived from one veterinary assistant, 12 operating room floor areas and hand-touch sites, three dogs and one cat. Methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) was found on an electric clipper and rebreathing circuits in the operating room. Three dogs were positive for MRSP during surgery, and one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected in a cat. All MRCoPS were resistant to doxycycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and enrofloxacin, but no patients developed surgical site infections. According to their genotypic patterns, the clones obtained from the environment and human sources differed from the animal clones. Despite intensive hygienic management, a variety of MRCoPS clones were present within the surgical unit and during surgery. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science."
2-s2.0-85013644927,"Background/Aim: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that possess self-renewal and differentiation capacities. CSCs contribute to drug-resistance, cancer recurrence and metastasis, thus development of CSCtargeted therapeutic strategies has recently received significant attention in cancer research. In this study, the potential efficacy of renieramycin M (RM) isolated from the sponge Xestospongia species, was examined against lung CSCs. Materials and Methods: Colony and spheroid formation assays, as well as western blotting analysis of lung CSC protein markers were employed to determine the CSC-like phenotypes of H460 lung cancer cells after treatment with RM at non-toxic concentrations. Results: RM treatment reduced significantly colony and spheroid formation of H460 cells. Moreover, the CSC markers CD133, CD44 and ALDH1A1 of CSC-enriched H460 cells were reduced significantly following RM treatment. Conclusion: RM could be a potent antimetastatic agent by suppressing lung CSC-like phenotypes in H460 cells."

Brum.f. derived from Chachoengsao Province, Thailand. The strains contained cytochrome oxidase and catalase activities. They grew in 4 % (w/v) NaCl, at a pH range of 6.0-9.0 (optimally at pH 7) and at 20-42ºC (optimally at 30-37ºC). The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone with eight isoprene units (Q-8). The major fatty acids were C16:0 and C17:0 cyclo. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains represent a species belonging to the genus Achromobacter and are closely related to Achromobacter xylosoxidans NBRC 15126T (98.80 %), Achromobacter insolitus LMG 6003T (98.64 %), Achromobacter aminicus LMG 26690T (98.59 %), Achromobacter pulmonis LMG 26696T (98.58 %) and Achromobacter insuavis LMG 26845T (98.58 %). The DNA G+C content of strain AVA-1T was 66.5 mol%. The novel strains had low DNA-DNA relatedness values with related type strains. On the basis of the phenotypic and genotypic data obtained, the strains clearly represent a novel species, for which the name Achromobacter aloeverae sp. nov. is proposed.

2-s2.0-85014193693,"This is an exploratory study to examine the quality or usefulness of accounting estimates of companies in China and India over time. Specifically, we examine how well the accounting estimates are able to predict future earnings and cash flows during the period 2003-2013. The results for India indicate that the out-of-sample earnings and cash flow predictions derived are more accurate and more efficient in the more recent period (2010-2013) than the earlier period (2003-2006). In contrast, the out-of-sample earnings and cash flow predictions for China are generally more biased, less accurate, and less efficient. The results indicate abnormal returns earned on hedge portfolios formed on earnings (cash flow) predictions for India in the recent period. In contrast, none of the portfolios for China earn positive returns. The results suggest that the accounting estimates in India in recent years have become better predictors of future earnings and cash flow than accounting estimates in the earlier period. However, the accounting estimates in China are not relevant for predicting earnings and cash flows over the years in the sample period. © Author(s) 2016."

The protein profiles in relevant with seasonal variations in Butea superba leaves collected in winter, summer and rainy season were evaluated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with a nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupoletime- of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The 84 proliferated protein spots were sum up of total proteins, which were found in 3 season-collected plant leaves and were classified into 11 functional groups. Eight proteins which exhibited the alteration of abundant levels in different seasons were found involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, stress, RNA metabolism, ROS scavenging and detoxifying, and protein destination and storage. There were 2 proteins exhibited obviously isozyme polypeptide sequences. The variable physiological status within the plant leaf might be influenced by the quantitative and qualitative proliferated protein presences with response to seasonal changes and thus allowing plant to survive during severe abiotic stresses during seasonal changes. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

2-s2.0-85013374519,"Immunophenotyping is a valuable method for prognosis in canine malignant lymphoma. The general B-cell marker is CD79a; however, Pax5 or B-cell specific activator protein, a transcription factor that controls B-cell identity and cell maturation, could also be used as a B-cell indicator in canine lymphomas. This study aimed to use Pax5, CD79a and CD3 expression in immunohistochemistry of spontaneous canine lymphomas, in order to carry out diagnosis and histopathological classification according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Forty-six retrospective cases including 33 multicentric, eight extranodal, and five alimentary lymphomas in dogs were immunostained by anti-Pax5 and anti-CD79a antibodies for B-cell identification, and anti-CD3 antibody for T-cell identification. T-cell lymphomas (CD3+/Pax5-/CD79a-) accounted for 30.43% of cases (14/46), and four of the lymphomas (28.57%) presented with CD3+/Pax5-/CD79a+. Conversely, B-cell lymphomas (CD3-/ Pax5+/CD79a+) accounted for 69.57% of cases (32/46) and 12.5% of these (4/32) showed only Pax5-positive cells (CD3-/Pax5+/CD79a-). Therefore, in dogs, Pax5 appears to be a more useful marker for staining all B-cell subtypes compared to CD79a.

2-s2.0-85013269731,"Degradation and destruction of mangrove forests in many regions have resulted in the alteration of carbon cycling. Objectives of this study were established to answer the question regarding how much soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in wetland soils in part of the upper northeastern Gulf of Thailand and to what extent SOC is related to organic matter (OM). A total of 29 soil samples were collected in October 2015. Soil physiochemical analyses followed the standard protocol. Spatial distributions were estimated by a kriging method. Linear regression and coefficient were used to determine the suitable conversion factor for mangrove soils. The results showed that surface soil (0-5 cm) contained higher SOC content as compared to subsurface soil (5-10 cm). Considering a depth of 10 cm, this area had a high potential to sequester carbon with a mean ± standard deviation of 5.59 ± 2.24%. The spatial variability of OM and SOC revealed that organic matter and carbon decreased with the distance from upstream areas toward the gulf. Based on the assumption that OM is 50% SOC, the conversion factor of 2 is recommended for more accuracy rather than the conventional factor of 1.724.

2-s2.0-85013167659,"Rhodomyrtone, a natural antimicrobial compound, displays potent activity against many Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, comparable to last-defence antibiotics including vancomycin and daptomycin. Our previous studies pointed towards effects of rhodomyrtone on the bacterial membrane and cell wall. In addition, a recent molecular docking study suggested that the compound could competitively bind to the main bacterial cell division protein FtsZ. In this study, we applied a computational approach (in silico), in vitro, and in vivo experiments to investigate molecular interactions of rhodomyrtone with FtsZ. Using molecular simulation, FtsZ conformational changes were observed in both (S)- and (R)-rhodomyrtone binding states, compared with the three natural states of FtsZ (ligand-free, GDP-, and GTP-binding states). Calculations of free binding energy showed a higher affinity of FtsZ to (S)-rhodomyrtone (-35:92 ± 0.36 kcal mol-1) than the GDP substrate (-23:47 ± 0.25 kcal mol-1) while less affinity was observed in the case of (R)-rhodomyrtone (-18:11 ± 0.11 kcal mol-1). In vitro experiments further revealed that rhodomyrtone reduced FtsZ polymerization by 36% and inhibited GTPase activity by up to 45%. However, the compound had no effect on FtsZ localization in Bacillus subtilis at inhibitory concentrations and cells also did not elongate after treatment. Higher concentrations of rhodomyrtone did affect localization of FtsZ and also affected localization of its membrane anchor proteins FtsA and SepF, showing that the compound did not specifically inhibit FtsZ but rather impaired multiple divisome proteins. Furthermore, a number of cells adopted a beanlike shape suggesting that rhodomyrtone possibly possesses further targets involved in cell envelope synthesis and/or maintenance. © 2017 Saeloh et al."

From these samples, 345 Salmonella isolates were collected from Sa Keao (n = 145; 23%) and Banteay Meanchey (n = 200; 47%) and assayed for antimicrobial susceptibility, class 1 integrons and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes. Serovars Typhimurium (29%) and Rissen (29%) were the most common serotypes found in Thai and Cambodian isolates, respectively. Multidrug resistance was detected in 34% and 52% of isolates from Sa Keao and Banteay Meanchey, respectively. The majority of the Thai isolates were resistant to ampicillin (72.4%), whereas most Cambodian isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole (71%). Eleven isolates from Sa Keao and 44 from Banteay Meanchey carried class 1 integrons comprising resistance gene cassettes. The most common gene cassette array was dfrA12-aadA2 (61.1%). Six isolates were ESBL producers. The β-lactamase genes found included blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-55 and blaCMY-2. Some of these class 1 integrons and ESBL genes were located on conjugative plasmid. In conclusion, multidrug-resistant Salmonella are common in pigs, chickens and their products in the Thailand–Cambodia border provinces.

The goal of this paper is to examine the problem, investigate the cause and explore the current state of the problem in effort to design a prevention system and offer a solution. Qualitative and quantitative methods were implemented based on 4,868 questionnaires, 20 focus groups interviews and 82 in-depth interviews from 12 provinces throughout Thailand. The research indicates that in Thai society, the informal debt is deeply intertwined with the formal debt. The informal debt causes by both internal and external factors. Whereas the internal factor is the individual behaviors, the external factors are the negative imbalance of income and expenses, and the emergency financial need irrespective of the exorbitantly high interest rates charged on informal debt of 5–20% per month. Living in poverty and working in informal economic sector without adequate social welfare keep people besieged within informal debt cycle endlessly. Thus, informal debt is both the cause and consequence of the social and economic inequality.

2-s2.0-85011966199,"The diversity and abundance of marine crabs from a collapsible crab trap fishery at Kung Krabaen Bay, Gulf of Thailand, were observed from August 2012 to June 2013 using 10 sampling stations. The results showed that there were seven families, 11 genera and 17 species (two anomuran and 15 brachyuran crabs). The two anomuran species were Clibanarius virescens (1,710 individuals) and Clibanarius infraspinatus (558 individuals). For brachyuran crabs, Portunidae was the most common family, including 10 species. The dominant species of brachyuran crabs included Thalamita crenata (897 individuals), Portunus pelagicus (806 individuals), Charybdis affinis (344 individuals), Scylla sp. (201 individuals), and Charybdis anisodon (100 individuals). The abundance of crabs was affected by the habitat type. Anomuran crabs had the highest abundance in Halodule pinifolia seagrass beds, whilst brachyurans had the highest abundance in Enhalus acoroides seagrass beds. The dominant brachyuran species were found in pelagic areas near the bay mouth, such as P. pelagicus, P. sanguinolentus, C. feriatus, C. helleri, C. natator, C. affinis, and M. hardwickii. Lastly, reforested mangroves were important habitats for Scylla tranquebarica and C. anisodon. Seasonal and physical factors influenced the abundance of some crabs, for example, the abundance of C. virescens was correlated with temperature, and the abundance of T. crenata was correlated with transparency depth. Our results revealed that Kung Krabaen Bay serves as the home to many marine crab species; however, our results also revealed that 49% of the harvested crabs (2,308 out of 4,694 individuals) were simply discarded and subsequently died. Moreover, our research noted that eight non-target species will become target species in the near future. Therefore, research on the reproductive biology of some marine crabs and an improved understanding of the importance of marine crabs by local fishermen are necessary to prevent biodiversity degradation and loss in this area. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017."
2-s2.0-85011878078,"In this paper, a multi-band enabled femtocell base station (FCBS) and user equipment (UE) architecture is proposed in a multi-tier network that consists of small cells, including femtocells and picocells deployed over the coverage of a macrocell for splitting uplink and downlink (UL/DL) as well as control-plane and user-plane (C-/U-plane) for 5G mobile networks. Since splitting is performed at the same FCBS, we define this architecture as the same base station based split architecture (SBSA). For multiple bands, we consider co-channel (CC) microwave and different frequency (DF) 60 GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for FCBSs and UEs with respect to the microwave band used by their over-laid macrocell base station. All femtocells are assumed to be deployed in a 3-dimensional multi-storage building. For CC microwave band, cross-tier CC interference of femtocells with macrocell is avoided using almost blank subframe based enhanced inter-cell interference coordination techniques. The co-existence of CC microwave and DF mmWave bands for SBSA on the same FCBS and UE is first studied to show their performance disparities in terms of system capacity and spectral efficiency in order to provide incentives for employing multiple bands at the same FCBS and UE and identify a suitable band for routing decoupled UL/DL or C-/U-plane traffic. We then present a number of disruptive architectural design alternatives of multi-band enabled SBSA for 5G mobile networks for UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, including a disruptive and complete splitting of UL/DL and C-/U-plane as well as a combined UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, by exploiting dual connectivity on CC microwave and DF mmWave bands. The outperformances of SBSA in terms of system level capacity, average spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and control-plane overhead traffic capacity in comparison with different base stations based split architecture (DBSA) are shown.

2-s2.0-85012236958,"The study investigates systematicity in English interlanguage of dependent prepositions among L1 Thai learners of L2 English. It is hypothesized that Thai learners show non-random use of English dependent prepositions in their English interlanguage, and that the systematicity is largely attributable to cross-linguistic influence and certain cognitive factors. To test the hypothesis, 30 L1 Thai undergraduate students of L2 English at elementary, intermediate, and advanced proficiency levels took two tests: a Thai-English translation test and a cloze test. The tests involved four types of relationship between English and Thai dependent prepositions: (1) [-prep] in English but [+prep] in Thai, (2) [+prep] in English but [-prep] in Thai, (3) [+prep1] in English but [+prep2] in Thai, and (4) [+prep] in English and [+prep] in Thai. The findings demonstrate that systematicity occurred in the learners' English usage of prepositions of all such types, possibly due to negative transfer from the learners' native language. Also, the L2 learners tended to exhibit such systematicity irrespective of their English proficiency level. It may be assumed that the cognitive aspect of L2 learners' working memory is involved in processing the usage of the four types of English dependent prepositions. The results of the study are expected to shed light on the problems of L2 English interlanguage of dependent prepositions among L1 Thai learners."
2-s2.0-85011693174,"In the present study, the catalytic dehydration of ethanol over H-beta zeolite (HBZ) catalyst with ruthenium (Ru-HBZ) and platinum (Pt-HBZ) modification was investigated. Upon the reaction temperature between 200 and 400°C, it revealed that ethanol conversion and ethylene selectivity increased with increasing temperature for both Ru and Pt modification. At lower temperature (200 to 250°C), diethyl ether (DEE) was the major product. It was found that Ru and Pt modification on HBZ catalyst can result in increased DEE yield at low reaction temperature due to increased ethanol conversion without a significant change in DEE selectivity. By comparing the DEE yield of all catalysts in this study, the Ru-HBZ catalyst apparently exhibited the highest DEE yield (ca. 47%) at 250°C. However, at temperature from 350 to 400°C, the effect of Ru and Pt was less pronounced on ethylene yield. With various characterization techniques, the effects of Ru and Pt modification on HBZ catalyst were elucidated. It revealed that Ru and Pt were present in the highly dispersed forms and well distributed in the catalyst granules. It appeared that the weak acid sites measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption technique also decreased with Ru and Pt promotion. Thus, the increased DEE yields with the Ru and Pt modification can be attributed to the presence of optimal weak acid sites leading to increased intrinsic activity of the catalysts. It can be concluded that the modification of Ru and Pt on HBZ catalyst can improve the DEE yields by ca. 10%. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society."
2-s2.0-85011406176,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst material because of its stability and hypotoxicity.

Moreover, how to improve photocatalytic H2production without any co-catalyst remains a big challenge. Here, we report a conceptual strategy in a core–shell nanostructure of simultaneously reducing the band gap and the charge carrier recombination rate by introducing a carbon-doped porous TiO2layer onto a metallic TiC nanostructure using a facile in situ thermal growth method. TiC@C-TiO2core–shell nanostructure materials have higher photocatalytic activity in methanol aqueous solution than those of pure P25 and carbon-doped TiO2, which results from enhanced visible light absorption, drastic charge transfer, and the large surface area. Notably, the novel core–shell nanostructures still exhibit excellent photocatalytic H2production without Pt co-catalyst. The results demonstrate that TiC is an ideal support for TiO2photocatalysts, and this novel core–shell nanostructure can significantly shift the position of the band edge of the obtained material. This study presents a design principle for photocatalytic materials as highly efficient visible light photocatalysts. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."
2-s2.0-85011844252,"This paper describes the search for a high-mass narrow-width scalar particle decaying into a Z boson and a photon. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 2.7 fb−1, respectively. The Z bosons are reconstructed from opposite-sign electron or muon pairs. No statistically significant deviation from the standard model predictions has been found in the 200-2000 GeV mass range. Upper limits at 95% confidence level have been derived on the product of the scalar particle production cross section and the branching fraction of the Z decaying into electrons or muons, which range from 280 to 20 fb for resonance masses between 200 and 2000 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2017, The Author(s)."
2-s2.0-85011573197,A highly sensitive fluorescent turn-on cyanide probe is developed based on benzylidenes containing methylindolium group. Three benzylidene derivatives were synthesized from the condensations of three benzaldehyde derivatives and methyleneindoline. Only one of these three derivatives shows strong blue fluorescent response selectively to CN−which can be clearly observed in submicromolar range as the result of the cyanide addition to the indolium group. The detection of cyanide with this compound is optimized in aqueous media using non-ionic surfactant and sonication method to give very low limit of detection in subnanomolar range. The probe is also developed into a paper-based and gel-based sensing kits that can readily detect cyanide ion in micromolar range by naked eye under a common black light (360 nm) illumination. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
2-s2.0-85011272765,"Objectives: Most workers in auto part factories in Thailand are usually exposed to excessive noise in their workplace. This study aimed to assess the level of occupational noise-induced hearing loss and investigate risk factors causing hearing loss in auto part factory workers in the welding units in Thailand. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. One hundred eighty subjects were recruited from 356 workers in the welding unit of three factories. Sixty eligible subjects in each factory were selected by systemic random sampling. The subjects were interviewed using a face-to-face questionnaire. Noise exposure levels and audiograms were measured by a noise dosimeter and an audiometer, respectively. Results: The findings confirmed that noise exposure levels of 86-90 dB (A) and exceeding 90 dB (A) significantly increased the risk of hearing loss in either ear. A noise exposure level exceeding 90 dB (A) significantly increased the prevalence of hearing loss in both ears. Regarding, a 10-pack-year smoking history increased the prevalence of hearing loss in either ear or both ears. In addition, subjects with employment duration exceeding 10 years significantly developed hearing loss in either ear. Conclusions: The engineering control or personal control by wearing hearing protection device should be used to decrease noise exposure levels lower than 85 dB (A) for 8 h. Moreover, if the exposure level reaches 85 dB (A) for 8 h, the employer needs to implement a hearing conservation program in the workplace."
2-s2.0-85010850455,"Low cost fumed silica (fSi) modified by polyethyleneimine (MWof 800) at 40 wt.% (fSi-PEI800-40) appears to be a promising sorbent for the binary sorption of CO2and H2S. This study aimed to pelletize this powder sorbent using an extrusion method with starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or bentonite clay as a binder. The effect of the amount and type of the binder on the mechanical strength and the CO2and H2S binary sorption performance of the sorbent were evaluated. The molecular weight of binder appeared to have an important effect on the sorbent's strength, where PVA at 5 wt.% gave the pelletized sorbent the highest mechanical strength (0.892 MPa) but a slightly lower sorption capacity for CO2and H2S than did bentonite clay. The sorption capacity decreased with increasing levels of binder because strong interactions between the binder and particles resulted in particle aggregation. The pre-treatment conditions and flow rate of the mixed gas (CH4/CO2/H2S/N2) were investigated in an up-scale system. The pelletized sorbents could be regenerated at a mild temperature (90 °C) for at least 18 reuse cycles, and so the fSi-PEI800-40/PVA5% sorbent has a high potential for application in the acid gas treatment process. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

Methods and Study Design: This clinical, cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2014 to February 2015 at National Cancer Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. Stage III/IV esophageal cancer patients were assessed for their nutritional status (patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) and SGA scores, BMI, mid-arm circumference (MAC), energy and protein intakes, weight changes, Karnofsky and Eastern cooperative oncology group performance scores (KPS/ECOG), and Glasgow prognostic score (GPS). Results: Sixty-four male patients were enrolled. The mean ± standard deviation of PG-SGA score was 9.88±4.41. SGA revealed 44% as class B and 6.2% as class C. The BMI revealed 43.8% of patients were underweight. MAC measurement revealed 29.7% of undernourished patients. Patients with an energy intake < 25 kcal/kg/d comprised 54.7%, and 48.4% with < 1 g/kg/day of protein. Totally, 68.8%, 84.4% and 92.2% patients exhibited weight loss past 2-weeks, one-month and six-months, respectively. The PG-SGA and SGA strongly correlated with the KPS (r=-0.717 and 0.632, both p < 0.001) and ECOG (r=0.672 and 0.626, both p < 0.001), but were weakly correlated with the GPS (r=0.332 and 0.278, p < 0.01 and 0.05). The KPS, ECOG, BMI, MAC, energy and protein intakes, and weight change were not correlated with the GPS. Conclusions: Malnutrition, weight change, and insufficient intake were noteworthy in esophageal cancer patients. The PG-SGA and SGA were strongly correlated with the performance status, but weakly correlated with prognostic indices."
2-s2.0-85011286637,"We present an alternative way to fabricate a N-doped carbon matrix via a room temperature solution plasma process. The type of C-N bonding states was controlled by choosing the structure of the original precursor and additive. In this research, pyridine and acrylonitrile were employed as the heterocyclic and linear structure precursor respectively. A small amount of anthracene (7 mM) was introduced as an additive to further promote the graphitic structure in the carbon matrix. The effects of the structure of the CN precursor on the chemical bonding states and electrocatalytic activities were investigated. The most pronounced peak was pyridinic-N when pyridine was applied as the precursor, whereas the dominant peak shifted to amino-N when the precursor changed to acrylonitrile. Furthermore, graphitic-N increased 30-40% when anthracene was added to the original precursors. From the results of electrochemical measurements, the current density was proportional to the content of graphitic-N, while a higher percentage of amino-N shifted the ORR onset potential to more positive values. N-doped carbon with the highest graphitic-N content showed the highest electron transfer number of 3.7 and the lowest peroxide yield of 30%. In contrast, N-doped carbon consisting of dominant pyridinic-N resulted in the lowest current density, ORR onset and peak potentials. The results indicated that the presence of graphitic-N encouraged a direct four electron transfer pathway for ORR. Herein, our research showed a room temperature solution method to control the chemical bonding states of nitrogen through designing the original precursors for the first time, as well as reports the synergic effect of amino-N and graphitic-N towards advanced ORR activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry."

According to 5 variables; media ingredients (3 variables), inoculums and pH; xylose and peptone were critical parameters affected on the xylitol production. Central composite design (CCD) was applied to screen for an optimal concentration of xylose and peptone. The highest xylitol production in flask scale was 42.52 g/l when xylose and peptone were 80 g/l and 4 g/l, respectively. The statistical regression model predicted the maximum xylitol production with 43.27 g/l, while the observed one was 42.52 g/l. Moreover, the production was scale up to 5 L by using stirred fermenter under the optimized condition. The highest xylitol production and xylitol yield after 42 h cultivation were 71.59 g/l and 0.89 g/g xylose, respectively. The results of statistical model and 5 L fermenter indicated that the optimized medium increased xylitol yield up to 1.45 folds compared with an un-optimized condition.

2-s2.0-85010727500,"The microbial community in an ecosystem can be a guide to its environmental condition. This research utilized culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain preliminary profiles of marine prokaryote communities at 15 km (PT) and 52 km (TC) offshore of the coastal Andaman Sea, Phang Nga, Thailand. The more inland, PT site, exhibited lower prokaryote biodiversity and metabolic potentials than the TC site further offshore. The presence of a relatively high level of nitrite oxidizing Nitrosospira at PT (6.34%) raises an alert for potential coastal nitrogen pollution. The presence of selenium-reducing Sedimenticola at TC (8.35%) suggested an unusual presence of selenium that might be caused from underwater seismic activity, as a minimum of four tsunami events have occurred in this area previously. Monitoring these microorganisms may help understand the marine microbial communities around the tsunami-effected area and also the underwater sediment resuspension level. Our sequencing data highlighted the unique hydrography at this oceanographic position comprising freshwater from India and mangrove forest water runoff from Thailand, together with underwater land-slip. Global ocean comparison indicated bacterial diversity around TC and PT, similar to two other sites off Thailand (Tha Wang, Tham Phang and differing to that from the distant GS012, GS110b and GS049 sites. The potentially abundant microbial metabolic subsystems in TC supported its high biodiversity, whereas the missing metabolic subsystems in PT might require vigilant monitoring of the condition of Thai Andaman coast. Compared with the culture-dependent method, more than 26-fold number of species were recorded. Moreover, many cultured isolates were not the major species in the culture-independent profile. The data supported the significance of the culture-independent approach in obtaining the more comprehensive microbial databases. © 2017, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-85010670076,"The mixed gamma and chi crystalline phase alumina (M-Al) catalysts prepared by the solvothermal method were investigated for catalytic ethanol dehydration. The effects of calcination temperatures and Mo modification were elucidated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The catalytic activity was tested for ethylene production by dehydration reaction of ethanol in gas phase at atmospheric pressure and temperature between 200°C and 400°C. It was found that the calcination temperatures and Mo modification have effects on acidity of the catalysts. The increase in calcination temperature resulted in decreased acidity, while the Mo modification on the mixed phase alumina catalyst yielded increased acidity, especially in medium to strong acids. In this study, the catalytic activity of ethanol dehydration to ethylene apparently depends on the medium to strong acid. The mixed phase alumina catalyst calcined at 600°C (M-Al-600) exhibits the complete ethanol conversion having ethylene yield of 98.8% (at 350°C) and the Mo-modified catalysts promoted dehydrogenation reaction to acetaldehyde. This can be attributed to the enhancement of medium to strong acid with metal sites of catalyst. © 2017 Tharmmanoon Inmanee et al."

In Brazil, despite the free availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the public health system, the mortality rate due to Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis is still high. To obtain a more detailed picture of the population genetic structure of this species in southeast Brazil, we studied 108 clinical isolates from 101 patients and 35 environmental isolates. Among the patients, 59% had a fatal outcome mainly in HIV-positive male patients. All the isolates were found to be C. neoformans var. grubii major molecular type VNI and mating type locus alpha. Twelve were identified as diploid by flow cytometry, being homozygous (AαAα) for the mating type and by PCR screening of the STE20, GPA1, and PAK1 genes. Using the ISHAM consensus multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, 13 sequence types (ST) were identified, with one being newly described. ST93 was identified from 81 (75%) of the clinical isolates, while ST77 and ST93 were identified from 19 (54%) and 10 (29%) environmental isolates, respectively. The southeastern Brazilian isolates had an overwhelming clonal population structure. When compared with populations from different continents based on data extracted from the ISHAM-MLST database (mlst.mycologylab.org) they showed less genetic variability.

We sought to validate US imaging of the airway by comparison to CT-scan, and to assess its inter-and intra-observer reliability. We used submandibular sonographic imaging of the mouth and oropharynx to examine how well the ratio of tongue thickness to oral cavity height correlates with the ratio of tongue volume to oral cavity volume, an established tomographic measure of DAM. Methods-A cohort of 34 patients undergoing CT-scan was recruited. Study standardized assessments included CT-measured ratios of tongue volume to oropharyngeal cavity volume; tongue thickness to oral cavity height; and US-measured ratio of tongue thickness to oral cavity height. Two sonographers independently performed US imaging of the airway before and after CT-scan. Results-Our findings indicate that the US-measured ratio of tongue thickness to oral cavity height highly correlates with the CT-measured ratio of tongue volume to oral cavity volume. US measurements also demonstrated strong inter-and intraobserver reliability. Conclusions-This study suggests that US is a valid and reliable tool for imaging the oral and oropharyngeal parts of the airway, as well as for measuring the volumetric relationship between the tongue and oral cavity, and may therefore be a useful predictor of DAM. © 2016 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine."

The Zn/Co-ZIF possesses a high nano-crystallinity and porosity with a large surface area. By tuning the amount of Co and Zn in the Zn/Co zeolitic imidazolate framework, the physical and chemical properties have been improved compared with those of the single metal frameworks (ZIF-8 and ZIF-67).

This is the first report on plant-growth promoting bacterium with versatile capability of TCC degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The aerobic degradation of TCC occurred completely of which the kinetic analysis revealed a non-self-inhibitive substrate effect, and broad-concentration-range degradation efficiency (ranging from 0.16–30 mg L−1). Anaerobic TCC degradation was feasible, but was significantly enhanced up to 40–50% when ferric, or acetate was provided as electron donor, or acceptor, respectively. TCC biodegradation under both conditions was proposed to initially occur through hydrolysis leading to transient accumulation of chloroanilines, which could be completely metabolized and detoxified. With concern on TCC adverse effect to plants, role of MC22 on toxicity mitigation was investigated using two legume plants: Vigna radiata and Glycine max (L.) Merr. Upon TCC exposure, damage of both plant structures, especially root system was observed, but was substantially mitigated by MC22 bioaugmentation.

In the AdS6 vacua this gauge group is broken to its maximal compact subgroup SO(3) × H′′ × H″ where H′ ⊂ SO(m) and H″ ⊂ SO(n − m).

The method is using low-temperature pyrolysis (torrefaction) to remove unfavorable compounds firstly and then using high-temperature catalytic pyrolysis to produce hydrocarbons. The effects of torrefaction temperature, residence time and atmosphere on product distribution were investigated. The results show that the acidity of produced liquids reduced with increasing torrefaction temperature and residence time. Torrefaction pretreatment of pinewood reduced the yields of acetic acid and guaiacol effectively during catalytic pyrolysis. The highest aromatic yield was obtained with torrefied pinewood at 250 °C, which was boasted 30% of that without torrefaction. Besides, torrefied biomass can obviously reduce coke deposition on ZSM-5 in the catalytic pyrolysis process compared with raw pinewood.

This study aimed to characterize the clinical and molecular features of four unrelated Thai patients with MPS VI. Two were products of consanguineous marriages. Materials and Methods: The diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical and genetic tests. We performed mutation analysis by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing on the entire coding region of the ARSB gene. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis combined with direct sequencing was also used to search for a deletion boundary. Results: The causative mutations were detected in all cases. Of four different mutations identified, three have never been previously described, which included two missense mutations (p.C155Y and p.R388T) and a deletion encompassing exons 2 and 3. Both missense mutations were absent in 110 unaffected ethnic-matched control chromosomes and an in-house database of 180 Thai exomes. The p.C155Y and p.R388T mutations were located in highly conserved residues. A CGH analysis combined with direct sequencing identified the breakpoints of a large 13,788 base pair deletion.

2-s2.0-85009170670,"This paper proposes an interval analysis scheme to map out the complete bound spectrum of the most maximum and most minimum responses of geometrically nonlinear elastoplastic structures subjected to both interval applied loads and interval inelastic material properties. The proposed heuristic method uses a finite-step holonomic formulation under pseudodisplacement control. Geometric nonlinearity is modeled using a conventional second-order approximation. The analysis thus determines directly the most maximum and most minimum bound solutions by processing a pair of optimization problems, known as interval mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints or interval MPECs. The simultaneous presence of complementarity constraints and interval data is the main cause of difficulties (associated with nonconvex and/or nonsmooth optimization programs) underpinning the interval MPECs considered. The simple solution approach proposed reformulates the interval MPECs into their noninterval nonlinear programming counterparts that can be processed by a smoothing regularization technique. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed interval analysis scheme are illustrated through a number of numerical examples motivated by various engineering applications, such as the safety assessment of multistory frames that are prone to geometric nonlinearity and interval uncertainties. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The highest CO2sorption level was 93.4% under optimized CTFB operating conditions. The important parameters for CO2capture were the inlet gas velocity and the interactions between the CO2concentration and the inlet gas velocity and water vapor concentration.

2-s2.0-85009074636,"Structural, electronic, optical and mechanical properties of Zn, Si, Sn and S substitutions on InP supercell under pressure in zinc blende (ZB) and rock salt (RS) phases are presented using first-principles method. Cohesive energy and enthalpy difference are observed, and found that the order of possible spontaneous process in experimental growth, which introduced from enthalpy difference, is (In,Zn)P > In(P,S) > In(Si,P) > In(Sn,P). The lower enthalpy difference in RS structure indicates that the spontaneous process of impurity substitution can be occurred in RS more than in ZB. Phase transition from ZB to RS reduces the strain on crystal lattice by the increasing of chemical bond length. The chemical bonding of Zn-P in ZB is the strongest sharing electrons when compared with other compounds, Zn-P>Si-In>S-In>Sn-In. The dielectric performance of InP is reduced by the alloying effect, and it transforms to the conductor performance as high frequencies. Order of photo-absorption coefficient in range of visible light with the impurities is Sn>Si>S>Zn, and it reduces under high-pressure. Mechanical stability of InP alloys was observed, and satisfied the Born stability criteria. The impurities reduce Shear modulus of pure InP. Poisson's ratio of InP alloys in RS exhibit small deformation and high isotropy, corresponding to high-symmetry cubic phase. B/G ratio indicates that ductility of InP alloys is reduced, when it transformed to RS. The ductility of InP is induced by the alloying effect due to the B/G ratio increasing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85008929547,"Objective: To investigate the effect of the position of the apical portion of closing loops on the force system at both loop ends. Materials and Methods: T-loops were compared with backward-sloped L-loops (SL) and reversed L-loops (RL). SL-loops were directed toward the anterior side; RL-loops were directed toward the posterior side. Loop response to loop pulling was determined with finite element analysis at six positions of the apical loop portion for 12-mm interbracket distance and 8-mm loop length and height. Three-dimensional models of the closing loops were created using beam elements with the properties of stainless steel. Loop responses (horizontal load/deflection, vertical force, and moment-to-force ratio) at both loop ends were calculated as well as at 100 g and 200 g activation forces. Results: T-, SL-, and RL-loops with the same position of the apical portion showed approximately the same force system at both loop ends. This behavior was found across the investigated range through which the loops were moved (interbracket center to posterior bracket). Conclusions: The center of the apical portion determined the force system of the closing loops regardless of the position of the loop legs. The centers of the apical portion of the T-, SL-, and RL-loops acted like V-bend positions. © 2017 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc."
2-s2.0-85008709498,"Background: Studies have indicated 34% - 49% of methamphetamines injections among people who inject drugs in Thailand. Essential blood-borne viral and bacterial infections prevention services targeting people who inject drugs should be included in interventional efforts. The aims of the present study were to determine a demographic profile and factors associated with methamphetamine injection within people who inject drugs population in Bangkok, Thailand. Method: Ninety-one people who inject drugs who reported injecting drugs in the previous six months and no kind of drug treatment were eligible in this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse respondents who reported injection of methamphetamine and those who did not. Results: Most of the respondents (87%) were male with an average age of 39 years. They had been injecting drugs for 20 years. Around one-third (32%) reported inject methamphetamine in the past month. Four factors were found to be significantly associated with methamphetamine injection which were sex (AOR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.03 – 0.83), age (AOR = 7.88; 95% CI = 1.76 – 35.27), period of injecting drugs (AOR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.03 – 0.62) and inject drugs in combination (AOR = 16.39; 95% CI = 1.94 – 137.87). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that methamphetamine injectors in Bangkok, Thailand were older male and had longer period of injection. Methamphetamine injections were associated with injecting in combination with other drugs. Therefore, harm reduction interventions for methamphetamine injectors should be tailored to this specific group of population. © 2017, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system with space groups C2/c, for 1 and P21/n, for 2. Complex 1 exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry with four nitrogen atoms of chelating en ligands and two oxygen atoms of water molecules coordinated to central Cu(II) ion, whereas complex 2 shows a square pyramidal geometry around copper(II) with four nitrogen atoms of chelating en ligands and one oxygen atom of water molecule. Crystal structures of both complexes are stabilized by collective interplay of various non-covalent interactions such as O–H⋯O, N–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions, besides electrostatic attraction.

This study aims to present socio demographic profile and drug injecting behaviours of PWID in Bangkok, Thailand in order to better inform the development of the interventions for PWID in the future. Method: The individual interviews with 125 PWID from the community were conducted. Ninety-one PWID who reported injecting drugs in the previous six months and no kind of drug treatment were eligible in this study. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS software package. Results: Most participants (86.8%) were male. Mean age of participants was 41 years old (SD 8.46). PWID in Bangkok had been injecting drugs for an average of 20 years (SD 8.50). PWID reported injection of midazolam (72.5%) and heroin (48.4%) at arm (68.1%) followed by groin (45.1%). There were 82.4% of study participants reported having received some form of drug treatment but they discontinued. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggested that PWID in Bangkok has a long history of drug injection and high injecting frequency. They practice unsafe injecting behaviors such as inject drugs in combination and injection at the groin. They discontinued drug treatment while still injecting drugs. Efforts should be made to further reach out PWID and provide tailored intervention to reduce harm associated with drug injection. © 2017, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

2-s2.0-85008462001,"Russell’s viper bites are potentially fatal from severe bleeding, renal failure and capillary leakage. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are attributed to these effects. In addition to specific antivenom therapy, endogenous inhibitors from snakes are of interest in studies of new treatment modalities for neutralization of the effect of toxins. Two major snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs): RVV-X and Daborhagin were purified from Myanmar Russell’s viper venom using a new purification strategy. Using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach to explore the Myanmar RV venom gland transcriptome, mRNAs of novel tripeptide SVMP inhibitors (SVMPIs) were discovered. Two novel endogenous tripeptides, pERW and pEKW were identified and isolated from the crude venom. Both purified SVMPs showed caseinolytic activity. Additionally, RVV-X displayed specific proteolytic activity towards gelatin and Daborhagin showed potent fibrinogenolytic activity. These activities were inhibited by metal chelators. Notably, the synthetic peptide inhibitors, pERW and pEKW, completely inhibit the gelatinolytic and fibrinogenolytic activities of respective SVMPs at 5 mM concentration. These complete inhibitory effects suggest that these tripeptides deserve further study for development of a therapeutic candidate for Russell’s viper envenomation. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

2-s2.0-85008336814,"Canopy transpiration (EC) is a large fraction of evapotranspiration, integrating physical and biological processes within the energy, water, and carbon cycles of forests. Quantifying EC is of both scientific and practical importance, providing information relevant to questions ranging from energy partitioning to ecosystem services, such as primary productivity and water yield. We estimated EC of four pine stands differing in age and growing on sandy soils. The stands consisted of two wide-ranging conifer species: Pinus taeda and Pinus sylvestris, in temperate and boreal zones, respectively. Combining results from these and published studies on all soil types, we derived an approach to estimate daily EC of pine forests, representing a wide range of conditions from 35ë S to 64ë N latitude. During the growing season and under moist soils, maximum daily EC (ECm) at day-length normalized vapor pressure deficit of 1 kPa (ECm-ref) increased by 0.55 ± 0.02 (mean ± SE) mm/d for each unit increase of leaf area index (L) up to L = ~5, showing no sign of saturation within this range of quickly rising mutual shading. The initial rise of ECm with atmospheric demand was linearly related to ECm-ref. Both relations were unaffected by soil type. Consistent with theoretical prediction, daily EC was sensitive to decreasing soil moisture at an earlier point of relative extractable water in loamy than sandy soils. Our finding facilitates the estimation of daily EC of wide-ranging pine forests using remotely sensed L and meteorological data. We advocate an assembly of worldwide sap flux database for further evaluation of this approach. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America."
2-s2.0-85008388804,"Introduction: Frontoethmoidal encephalomeningocele (FEEM) is a congenital disorder characterized by herniation of brain and meninges through an anterior skull defect. The main pathological changes are found internally at the foramen cecum and externally at the frontonaso-orbital region. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of developmental anomalies found in FEEM using multidetector computed tomography images of the facial bone. Methods: A total of 78 patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography scan of the facial bone during the January 1, 2003 to June 31, 2012 study period were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, size of internal defect, and intracranial anomalies were recorded. Results: Associated brain and ophthalmic anomalies were identified in 53 patients (67.9%), and all of those had brain anomalies. The most common brain anomalies were absent/undetermined septum pellucidum (75.5%), ventricular dilatation (71.7%), abnormal frontal horn (67.9%), and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (58.5%). Eight patients (10.3%) had ophthalmic anomalies. Patients with brain and ophthalmic anomalies tended to have a higher incidence of large-size internal defects. Conclusion: The authors found a high prevalence of developmental anomalies in FEEM patients. Absent/undetermined septum pellucidum was the most commonly found anomaly in this study. Brain and ophthalmic anomalies tended to have a higher incidence of large-size internal bone defects. Consistent with the authors' acknowledged limitation, further studies using dedicated brain MRI and magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate parenchymal abnormalities and vascular anomalies may be beneficial for surgical planning, prognosis, and the identification of clinical correlations.

2-s2.0-85008176637,"Exposure to crystalline silica (quartz) has been implicated as a potential cause of the high lung cancer rates in the neighbouring counties of Xuanwei and Fuyuan, China, where the domestic combustion of locally sourced “smoky” coal (a bituminous coal) is responsible for some of the highest lung cancer rates in the nation, irrespective of gender or smoking status. Previous studies have shown that smoky coal contains approximately twice as much quartz when compared to alternative fuels in the area, although it is unclear how the quartz in coal relates to household air pollution. Samples of ash and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were collected from 163 households and analysed for quartz content by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Additionally, air samples from 12 further households, were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate particle structure and silica content. The majority (89%) of household air samples had undetectable quartz levels (<0.2 μg/m3) with no clear differences by fuel-type. SEM analyses indicated that there were higher amounts of silica in the smoke of smoky coal than smokeless coal (0.27 μg/m3vs. 0.03 μg/m3). We also identified fibre-like particles in a higher concentration within the smoke of smoky coal than smokeless coal (5800 fibres/m3vs. 550 fibres/m3). Ash analysis suggested that the bulk of the quartz in smoky coal went on to form part of the ash. These findings indicate that the quartz within smoky coal does not become adequately airborne during the combustion process to cause significant lung cancer risk, instead going on to form part of the ash. The identification of fibre-like particles in air samples is an interesting finding, although the clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85007573014,"The treatment of highly recalcitrant and non-biodegradable solutions of 1 mM of o-toluidine has been comparatively treated by different water treatment technologies based on Fenton's reaction: conventional Fenton process, electro-assisted Fenton process and electro-assisted photo-Fenton process. The pollutant was mainly oxidized by the homogeneous [rad]OH released in situ by the Fenton's reaction. The electro-assisted photo-Fenton technology demonstrated better performance due to the faster electro-regeneration of iron(II) and the coupled photolysis of several by-products such carboxylic acids attaining complete o-toluidine removal in 60 min of treatment. The study of the biodegradability enhancement after the treatment achievieng values near to 0.4 of BOD5/COD ratio assessed the feasible application of electro-assisted photo-Fenton process as pre-biological treatment.

2-s2.0-85008400526,"Objective Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibroinflammatory liver disease. Autotaxin (ATX) has a profibrotic effect resulting from lysophosphatidic acid activity. The purpose of this study was to examine ATX expression and ATXpromoter methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes and liver tissues from BA patients and controls and investigate their associations with outcome parameters in BA patients. Methods A total of 130 subjects (65 BA patients and 65 age-matched controls) were enrolled. DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes and liver tissues of BA patients and from and agematched controls. ATX promoter methylation status was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. ATX expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Decreased methylation of specific CpGs were observed at the ATX promoter in BA patients. Subsequent analysis revealed that BA patients with advanced stage had lower methylation levels of ATX promoter than those with early stage. ATX promoter methylation levels were found to be associated with hepatic dysfunction in BA. In addition, ATX expression was significantly elevated and correlated with a decrease in ATX promoter methylation in BA patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, promoter hypomethylation and overexpression of ATXwere inversely associated with jaundice status, hepatic dysfunction, and liver stiffness in BA patients. Conclusion Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that ATX promoter methylation and ATX expression in peripheral blood may serve as possible biomarkers reflecting the progression of liver fibrosis in postoperative BA. These findings suggest that the promoter hypomethylation and overexpression of ATX might play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in BA. © 2017 Udomsinprasert et al.

2-s2.0-85007299040,"The development of different chitosan derivatives for medical applications has increased recently. Among these chitosan derivatives, quaternized chitosan was designed to improve the solubility of chitosan in biological fluids for oral drug delivery while retaining the cationic character for mucoadhesion. However, the biocompatibility of quaternized chitosan on the human intestine is unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine the potential biological effects of quaternized chitosan on the intestinal barrier, in terms of cell proliferation and cell differentiation, using the Caco-2 cell line as an in vitro model. The lower the degree of substitution of quaternized chitosan, the lower the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effect on Caco-2 cells. In addition, the anti-proliferative effect of quaternized chitosan might induce a cell cycle disturbance and differentiation delay. Long-term continuous exposure (9 days) to quaternized chitosan caused a delay in differentiation of the Caco-2 cells even at non-cytotoxic quaternized chitosan doses (0.005% (w/v)), as shown by the low level of alkaline phosphatase in the quaternized chitosan-treated group compared to the control cells. In contrast, short-term discontinuous exposure to quaternized chitosan (0.005% (w/v) for 4 h/day over 9 days) that more realistically mimics the daily intestinal exposure did not inhibit the intestinal differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Thus, the use of a low degree of substitution and a low concentration of quaternized chitosan resulted in a good biocompatibility to the intestinal barrier supporting the potential usefulness of quaternized chitosan in the application of an oral drug delivery system. © SAGE Publications."

2-s2.0-85007321859,"Gamma irradiation was used to fabricate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol)/sericin hydrogels with different sericin concentrations, and the physicochemical and biological properties of the gamma-irradiated poly(vinyl alcohol)/sericin hydrogels were characterized. Following gamma irradiation, the hydrogels had a high gel fraction (80%-95%), implying a high degree of crosslinking. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the crosslinking bonds within the hydrogels, as seen by the characteristic shift in the peak. Furthermore, a low tensile modulus together with a high elongation percentage indicated that the hydrogels were easy to handle. We also showed that all hydrogels released sericin simultaneously. The poly(vinyl alcohol)/sericin hydrogels with high sericin content released more sericin, possibly due to less crosslinking of the hydrogels. When L929 cells were cultured with the hydrogel extracts, the cells were viable and could proliferate, particularly for the cells cultured with the hydrogels containing a high sericin content, which released more sericin. Migration assays also demonstrated that the cells migrated toward the medium extract of hydrogels containing high sericin. We suggest that sterile gamma-irradiated poly(vinyl alcohol)/sericin hydrogels could be used as a wound dressing for the treatment of dry and low-exudate wounds. © SAGE Publications."
2-s2.0-85007005033,"Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a powerful technology for heat and power generation that can be combined with many applications. This study presents a thermodynamic analysis of the Ca-looping sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of bio-oil integrated with an SOFC. Acetic acid is used as a model compound to represent a bio-oil aqueous fraction. Useful heat from an SOFC is utilized in the regenerator to improve the performance of the SOFC system. The effects of key parameters in operating the Ca-looping sorption-enhanced steam reformer and SOFC are discussed. The results indicate that Ca-looping SESR integrated with SOFC has a higher performance than the conventional process. Increasing the SESR temperature, the CaO/fuel ratio, the SOFC temperature, and the fuel utilization increases the electrical efficiency, but it decreases with S/F ratio. Regarding an energy analysis, the regenerator requires higher energy when it operates at a high steam and CaO/fuel ratio but lower energy when it operates at high SESR temperatures. In addition, the system efficiency of the SOFC integrated process decreases with SESR temperature and steam due to the high amount of energy to feed and air preheating.

Traffic policemen, representing the high-exposure group for these toxic air pollutants, were observed, and the health risk to these workers was evaluated. Toluene was the predominant aromatic compound in the ambient and personal exposure samples. The maximum average ambient concentration of BTEX was 2968.96 μg/m3. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the most abundant CCs at all of the sampling sites, with the greatest mean concentrations of these substances being 21.50 μg/m3and 64.82 μg/m3, respectively. In the personal exposure samples, the highest levels of BTEX, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were 2231.85 μg/m3, 10.61 μg/m3, and 16.03 μg/m3, respectively. In terms of risk assessment, benzene posed the greatest cancer risk (at the 95% CI), followed by toluene, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde (1.15E-02, 5.14E-03, 2.84E-04, and 2.52E-04, respectively). Three risk factors were investigated to reduce the total cancer risk levels: reducing the chemical concentration, exposure time and exposure duration.

2-s2.0-85007415989,"Background and Objectives: Novelmultitined cannulae constitute an attractive option for ultrasound-guided radiofrequency neurotomy of cervical medial branches. The deployment tines increase the cannula's active area, thus altering its lesion size. Despite their theoretical benefits, multitined cannulae have not been assessed. In this bench study, we sought to investigate the lesions produced by a standard 18-gauge and 2 commercially available multitined deployment cannulae. We created ex vivo models to evaluate lesion morphology at a periosteal interface using approach angles likely to be encountered during an ultrasound-guided technique. Methods: Two ex vivo models were assembled using chicken breast tissue and bovine tibia. Monopolar lesions were carried out with 3 commercially available cannulae (18-gauge curved [S], 17-gauge with laterally deploying tines [N], and 18-gauge with distally deploying tines [T]). All cannulae were positioned at 0, 25, 45, and 90 degrees to the periosteal plane. For each angulation and cannula, 2 series of measurements were recorded to document lesion morphology in the axial and sagittal planes. Data collected included the lesion's surface area, shape, and dimensions relative to the needle tip. Results: A total of 240 lesions were analyzed. The performances of S and N cannulae were significantly affected by approach angle, with lesion size decreasing as the angle increased. In contrast, T cannulae displayed similar lesion surface areas at 0 and 90 degrees. The multitined N and T cannulae produced the largest lesions at 0/25 and 90 degrees, respectively. Lesion height varied inversely according to approach angle for S and N cannulae, whereas T cannulae displayed stable characteristics. Conclusions: Unlike their S and N counterparts, T cannulae demonstrated stable lesion characteristics at varying approach angles.

The study employed Hofstede’s ‘dimensions of national culture’ to aid in this analysis of Vietnamese school leadership. Qualitative data were used to construct case studies of principal decision-making in three Vietnamese schools. The findings highlight the strong influence of power distance and collectivism on the decision making of Vietnamese school principals. The results illuminate the value of adopting an ‘indigenous perspective’ on school leadership.

An adsorption study was carried out at different initial pHs, biosorbent doses, and initial Pb (II) concentrations, in batch experiments in order to evaluate the optimum conditions for Pb (II) removal. The results showed that CB-P obtained a larger specific surface area (8.41 m2/g) than CB-M400 (2.69 m2/g); however, the calcite in CB-M400 displayed a remarkably higher sorption capacity for Pb (II) than the aragonite in CB-P. The carbonization of organic matter in CB-P resulted in a higher calcium carbonate content and the formation of fixed carbon, increasing the adsorption capacity of CB-M400. Optimum conditions for removal of Pb (II) occurred at pH 4.0 with 0.2 g/L of the biosorbent dose. In an equilibrium study, Langmuir’s isotherm was fixed at R2 > 0.9; the maximum capacities were calculated to be 869.57 mg/g for CB-P and 1,573.56 mg/g for CB-M400. In a kinetic study, a pseudo second-order model was fixed; the higher adsorption rate was found in CB-M400. © 2017, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-85006386617,"Ubiquitous microbial communities in river sediments actively govern organic matter decomposition, nutrient recycling, and remediation of toxic compounds. In this study, prokaryotic diversity in two major rivers in central Thailand, the Chao Phraya (CP) and the Tha Chin (TC) distributary was investigated. Significant differences in sediment physicochemical properties, particularly silt content, were noted between the two rivers. Tagged 16S rRNA sequencing on a 454 platform showed that the sediment microbiomes were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and sulfur/sulfate reducing Deltaproteobacteria, represented by orders Desulfobacteriales and Desulfluromonadales together with organic degraders Betaproteobacteria (orders Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales) together with the co-existence of Bacteroidetes predominated by Sphingobacteriales. Enrichment of specific bacterial orders was found in the clayey CP and silt-rich TC sediments, including various genera with known metabolic capability on decomposition of organic matter and xenobiotic compounds. The data represent one of the pioneered works revealing heterogeneity of bacteria in river sediments in the tropics. © 2016 Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry."
2-s2.0-85006413295,"Aim: Recurrent IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common recurrent glomerular disease after kidney transplantation. Recurrent IgAN, in particular, with crescent formation or endocapillary proliferation might result in kidney allograft loss. However, the current treatment options of recurrent IgAN are conflicting. Methods: We have reported three kidney-transplanted recipients with biopsy-proven recurrent IgAN treated with four consecutive months of rituximab at the dose of 375 mg/1.73m2 without corticosteroids. Results: At median follow-up 20 months following rituximab administration, all three recipients demonstrated decrease in proteinuria severity, slow disease progression with a well-tolerated condition. This therapeutic effect is most probably mediated by the B cell depletion. Conclusion: Our three case reports suggest that the disease severity of recurrent IgAN with endocapillary proliferation regardless of crescent formation can be minimized by the four doses of monthly rituximab regimen. © 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology"
2-s2.0-85005976194,"We developed an assay comprising crude DNA lysis by simple heat treatment coupled loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue for Chlamydia trachomatis detection (petty patent pending), and evaluated the developed assay for its feasibility as a one-step point-of-care detection on 284 endocervical swab specimens from clinically symptomatic C. trachomatis and healthy subjects. This assay is sensitive to 0·04 pg of ompA, specific with six primers targeting C. trachomatis ompA region, rapid (45 min total assay time), inexpensive (approx. 3 USD/reaction), does not require sophisticated instrumentation, and has comparable assay effectiveness (95% specificity, 90–100% sensitivity) to bacterial DNA isolation by a commercial kit coupled with polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis (98–100% specificity, 87–100% sensitivity) based on the clinical samples test. The test result could be read by naked eye through the colour change from violet (negative) to sky blue (positive) for C. trachomatis-infected specimens. Further, this assay uses all safe chemical reagents and is hence safe to the users. Significance and Impact of the Study: Chlamydia trachomatis is the major bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. The clinical symptoms are broad, and chronic C. trachomatis infections could lead to blindness, ectopic pregnancy, sterility in males and females, and a higher risk of the development of cervical cancer. The result indicates the potential usefulness of our crude DNA lysis coupled loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue for a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and cost-effective assay for C. trachomatis detection from suspected specimens. This assay offers an alternative in the clinical diagnosis of C. trachomatis in resource-limited health-care facilities and clinical laboratories in developing countries, and in field tests. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology"

This study aims at the bioremediation of organically enriched sediment under green mussel rafts by two spionid polychaetes, Prionospio (Prionospio) membranacea and Prionospio (Minuspio) pulchra. The biomass increment from the two spionids in the bioremediation process revealed that P. (P.) membranacea was significantly more efficient in converting the organic waste to biomass in term of body weight than P. (M.) pulchra. The efficiency of the two polychaetes in the reduction of total organic matter in the sediment was not significantly different. The potential in bioremediation of organic matter in sediment by the two spionids was better than other polychaetes used in the bioremediation of the organic waste from aquaculture system.

Generally, PEs can be extracted from pressed Jatropha curcas L. seeds (PJS) using methanol; however, this approach has safety and health concerns. Thus, surfactants were introduced as alternative solvents for extraction and recovery processes. The extraction conditions were optimized by a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Nonionic surfactants had higher PE extraction efficiencies than anionic surfactants. The optimal extraction conditions consisted of 9.4% Dehydol LS12, 51.4 min of extraction time at 1:10 g mL−1, and agitation at 1000 rpm, which resulted in an 84% PEs extraction efficiency and 90% of the crude protein remaining in the residual. For PE recovery, cloud-point separation was selected to concentrate the PEs in the nonionic surfactant-rich phase with 5.9% (w/v) Na2SO4.

In this study, we focus on exam findings and digital facial analysis technology in individuals with Down syndrome in diverse populations. Photos and clinical information were collected on 65 individuals from 13 countries, 56.9% were male and the average age was 6.6 years (range 1 month to 26 years; SD = 6.6 years). Subjective findings showed that clinical features were different across ethnicities (Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans), including brachycephaly, ear anomalies, clinodactyly, sandal gap, and abundant neck skin, which were all significantly less frequent in Africans (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). Evaluation using a digital facial analysis technology of a larger diverse cohort of newborns to adults (n = 129 cases; n = 132 controls) was able to diagnose Down syndrome with a sensitivity of 0.961, specificity of 0.924, and accuracy of 0.943. Only the angles at medial canthus and ala of the nose were common significant findings amongst different ethnicities (Caucasians, Africans, and Asians) when compared to ethnically matched controls. The Asian group had the least number of significant digital facial biometrics at 4, compared to Caucasians at 8 and Africans at 7.

2-s2.0-85002596995,"Rhinacanthin-C is a major bioactive naphthoquinone ester found in Rhinacanthus nasutus Kurz (Acanthaceae). This compound has potential therapeutic value as an anticancer and antiviral agent. In this study, we investigated an enhancement effect of rhinacanthin-C on doxorubicin cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines and the involvement of the ABC drug efflux transporters. The cytotoxicity was determined by an MTT assay. Combination between doxorubicin and rhinacanthin-C at their non-cytotoxic concentrations when giving each compound alone significantly reduced cell viability in MCF-7 and MCF-7/DOX resistant cells. At the non-cytotoxic concentration (0.1 µM), rhinacanthin-C enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity by 38 fold in MCF-7 cells after 48-h treatment. Moreover, intracellular doxorubicin accumulation significantly increased in both MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/DOX resistance cells in the presence of rhinacanthin-C for 6-h treatment period. The interference of rhinacanthin-C on the ABC drug transporters (P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2) was evaluated by substrate accumulation assay, using fluorescence spectroscopy technique. Our results showed that rhinacanthin-C at 0.1 µM for 6-h treatment period could increase intracellular accumulation of transporter substrates in MCF-7 cells [i.e., CDCF by 1.65 fold (MRP2)] as well as in MCF-7/DOX resistance cells [i.e., CDCF by 1.18 fold (MRP2) and calcein by 1.38 fold (P-gp)]. In conclusion, rhinacanthin-C could enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity through interference on MRP2 and P-gp functions. Consequently, intracellular doxorubicin accumulation in the cells increased up to its cytotoxic level. Another potential mechanism of the synergy between rhinacanthin-C and doxorubicin would be investigated further. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-85001044609,"Using the atomistic tight-binding theory (TB) and a configuration interaction description (CI), we numerically compute the excitonic splitting of CdX(X = Se, S and Te)/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals with the objective to explain how types of the core materials and growth shell thickness can provide the detailed manipulation of the dark-dark (DD), dark-bright (DB) and bright-bright (BB) excitonic splitting, beneficial for the active application of quantum information. To analyze the splitting of the excitonic states, the optical band gaps, ground-state wave function overlaps and atomistic electron-hole interactions tend to be numerically demonstrated. Based on the atomistic computations, the single-particle and excitonic gaps are mainly reduced with the increasing ZnS shell thickness owing to the quantum confinement. In the range of the higher to lower energies, the order of the single-particle gaps is CdSe/ZnS, CdS/ZnS and CdTe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals, while one of the excitonic gaps is CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS and CdTe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals because of the atomistic electron-hole interaction. The strongest electron-hole interactions are mainly observed in CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals. In addition, the computational results underline that the energies of the dark-dark (DD), dark-bright (DB) and bright-bright (BB) excitonic splitting are generally reduced with the increasing ZnS growth shell thickness as described by the trend of the electron-hole exchange interaction. The high-to-low splitting of the excitonic states is demonstrated in CdSe/ZnS, CdTe/ZnS and CdS/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals because of the fashion in the electron-hole exchange interaction and overlaps of the electron-hole wave functions. As the resulting calculations, it is expected that CdS/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals are the best candidates to be the source of entangled photons. Finally, the comprehensive information on the excitonic splitting can enable the use of suitable core/shell nanocrystals for the entangled photons in the application of quantum information. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-85002293110,"The molecular characterization of nonrandom recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities has identified numerous disease-related genes involved in hematologic and lymphoid malignancies. Cytogenetic analysis has become essential for disease diagnosis, classification, prognostic stratification, and treatment guidance. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has greatly enhanced the field and enabled a more precise determination of the presence and frequency of genetic abnormalities. The advantages of FISH compared to standard cytogenetic analysis are that FISH can be used to identify genetic changes that are too small to be detected under a microscope, does not require cell culture, and can be applied directly on fresh or paraffin-embedded tissues for rapid evaluation of interphase nuclei. The application of FISH with a variety of chromosome-specific DNA probes helps to further define molecular subclasses and cytogenetic risk categories for patients with particular hematologic malignancies. FISH analysis is useful in identifying genetic abnormalities undetectable by conventional chromosomal analysis and monitoring residual disease during treatment and follow-up. Therefore, FISH has become an indispensable tool in the management of hematologic malignancies. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017."
2-s2.0-84999266495,"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus carrying toxin-producing plasmid, has led to severe mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp throughout Asia. Previous studies reported that a non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) could enhance disease tolerance in aquatic animals. Here, we investigate whether the NLHS could enhance the survival of shrimp Penaeusvannamei upon challenge with an AHPND-causing strain of V. Parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Two NLHS conditions, acute and chronic NLHSs, were used. The former abruptly exposed the juveniles shrimp from 28 °C to 38 °C for 30 min only once whereas the latter exposed the shrimp to 38 °C for 5 min every day for 7 days. The treated shrimp were, then, challenged with VPAHPND at day 3, day 7, and day 30 during the recovery time after the treatment. The results showed that the shrimp exposed to either acute or chronic NLHS had higher survival rate (>50%) than that of the non-heated shrimp control (20%) when they were challenged with VPAHPND at day 3 recovery time. However, only those exposed to chronic NLHS showed the VPAHPND protection at day 7 and day 30 recovery times. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of heat shock proteins, LvHSP70, LvHSP90 as well as other immune-related genes, LvproPO and LvCrustin, were induced upon exposure of shrimp to chronic NLHS. Interestingly, gene silencing of LvHSP70 and LvHSP90 eliminated the VPAHPND tolerance in the chronic NLHS shrimp and had decreasing PO activity suggesting that these LvHSPs played crucial roles in bacterial defense in shrimp. All together, we show for the first time that the NLHS enhance the shrimp tolerance to VPAHPND infection and this is likely mediated by the induction of LvHSP70, LvHSP90 and subsequent activation of the proPO system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-84997770159,"We assembled a dataset tabulating the weights of Thai and Indonesian mangrove trees that we measured between 1982 and 2001. We selected four Thai study sites in Phang Nga, Ranong, Satun, and Trat Provinces and one site in eastern Indonesia on Halmahera Island in Maluku Province. The stands in Ranong Province and on Halmahera Island were in primary forests with data collected in the 1980s and the remaining stands were in secondary forests with data collected later. We collected 124 tree samples from ten species (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera cylindrica, B. gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Sonneratia alba, S. caseolaris, Xylocarpus granatum, and X. moluccensis) and measured the root weights of 32 individuals of nine species (A. alba, B. cylindrica, B. gymnorrhiza, C. tagal, R. apiculata, R. mucronata, S. alba, S. caseolaris, and X. granatum). All sampled trees were subjected to a standardized protocol to obtain aboveground weights. The trunks were divided into horizontal segments from which the leaves and branches were collected separately. Roots were collected by winching them out of the ground, by trench digging, or by complete excavation. Thus, we were able to compile the weights of the trunk, branches, leaves, and roots of each tree sampled. Aerial roots were included in root weight measurements, although they were collected above ground. We compiled separate lists of trunk diameters, trunk heights, heights of the lowest living branches, and the heights of aerial roots on the trunks of trees in different size categories. Our dataset includes a wide range of tree sizes (maximum trunk diameter 48.9 cm), geographical locations (1°10′N–12°24′N, 98°32′E–123°49′E) and organ weights (trunks, branches, leaves, and roots), and therefore should prove useful in future biomass studies of mangrove forests. © 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan."
2-s2.0-84998579336,"C-type lectins are pattern recognition proteins that play important roles in innate immunity in invertebrates by mediating the recognition of pathogens. In this study, a novel C-type lectin gene, PmCLec, was cloned and characterized from the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. The open reading frame of PmCLec is 657 bp in length. It encodes a predicted protein of 218 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass and an isoelectric point of 24086 Da and 4.67, respectively. Sequence analysis of PmCLec showed similarity to members of the C-type lectin gene superfamily. The deduced protein contains a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and four conserved cysteine residues (Cys58, Cys126, Cys141, Cys149) that are involved in the formation of disulfide bridges. PmCLec transcripts are expressed in various tiger shrimp tissues, with the highest expression in the lymphoid organ. RNAi-mediated silencing of PmCLec resulted in higher cumulative mortality of knockdown shrimp after Vibrio harveyi infection compared to the control groups. Recombinant PmCLec was successfully expressed in the E. coli system. In the presence of Ca2+, purified rPmCLec protein binds and agglutinates Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. hemolyticus), but only slightly binds and agglutinates E. coli and could not bind to the Gram-negative bacteria Bacillus megaterium and Vibrio harveyi.

2-s2.0-84997514424,"The ultimate goal of this work was to develop a novel electrothermal micro-actuator, with ease of fabrication and low-cost, using a nickel electroplating technique. In this work, the properties of the nickel films deposited at an electroplating current density of 7.0 mA/cm2 using two electrolytes, i.e. nickel sulfate and nickel sulfamate solutions, were compared. From the material testing, the nickel sulfamate solution provided a nickel film with a rougher but softer surface; therefore, the solution was chosen in a process to fabricate the micro-actuators. The micro-actuators with a Z-shaped driving mechanism were designed with a variation in the gap between small and large arms. Within the range of experimental conditions, i.e. applying DC current of 3–5 A for 30 s, average temperature of the driving mechanism was less than 100 °C, at which the micro-actuator with the gap of 200 μm provided the largest displacement of around 250 ± 32 μm and the magnitude of the force higher than 4.5 ± 0.8 mN. All micro-actuators could appropriately respond to a driving frequency up to 1 Hz. In addition, no significant decrement of the magnitude of the exerting force was observed within 21,600 actuating cycles. Lastly, the micro-gripper was fabricated and tested.

One-hundred fifty-seven (4.6%) samples tested positive for influenza B virus by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). While the influenza B virus Yamagata lineage strains were more prevalent than the Victoria lineage strains in 2015 (77.5% vs. 22.5%), the Victoria lineage strains appeared to dominate the first half of 2016 (62.3%). To better assess possible lineage shift in this transition period, 73 influenza B virus strains circulating between March 2014 and May 2016 were randomly selected for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed clustering in Yamagata clade 3 (61.6%), Victoria clade 1 (20.6%), and Yamagata clade 2 (17.8%). Analyses of both the HA and NA segments together, however, demonstrated that 5 influenza B strains (6.8%) were of mixed lineages. Our findings suggest that the circulating strains of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages underwent another lineage shift in 2016.

2-s2.0-84995751226,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is one of the most important swine pathogens, and causes a major economic impact worldwide. Recently, a new variant type 2 PRRSV, highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) has emerged and continued to circulate in Southeast Asia region. Currently, commercially available PRRSV vaccines, modified live PRRS vaccines (MLV) are not able to provide complete protection against HP-PRRSV and been reported to induce negative immunomodulatory effects. Interestingly, a novel DNA vaccine was developed and successfully used to improve PRRSV-specific immune responses following MLV vaccination. To investigate the efficacy of a heterologous DNA-MLV prime-boost immunization against the HP-PRRSV infection, an experimental vaccinated-challenged study was conducted. Two-week-old, PRRSV-seronegative, crossbred pigs (5–8 pigs/group) were allocated into 5 groups. At day −14 (D-14), the treatment group (DNA-MLV) was immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding PRRSV-truncated nucleocapsid protein (pORF7t), followed by a commercial modified live type 2 PRRS vaccine (MLV) at D0. The other groups included the group that received PBS at D-14 followed by MLV at D0 (MLV), pORF7t at D-14 (DNA), PBS at D0 (PBS) and the negative control group. At D42, all groups, except the negative control group, were challenged with HP-PRRSV (strain 10PL1). The results demonstrated that pigs that received MLV, regardless of the DNA priming, exhibited less clinical signs and faster viral clearance. Following HP-PRRSV challenge, the DNA-MLV group exhibited improved PRRSV-specific immunity, as observed by increased neutralizing antibody titers and PRRSV-specific IFN-γ production, and reduced IL-10 and PRRSV-specific Treg productions. However, neither the prime-boost immunization nor the MLV was able to induce complete clinical protection against HP-PRRSV infection. In conclusion, improved immunological responses, but not clinical protection, were achieved by DNA-MLV prime-boost immunization. This study highlights the potential use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimen, where DNA can be incorporated with other vaccine candidates, for improving anti-PRRSV immunity that may eventually lead induction of complete PRRSV protection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

2-s2.0-84995480411,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in long-term carbon storage in forest ecosystems. However, few studies have examined CWD in mangrove forests. A secondary mangrove forest on an estuary of the Trat River showed different structures along vegetation zones ranging from the river’s edge to inland parts of the forest (the Sonneratia–Avicennia, Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zones, respectively). The mass distribution of CWD stock in downed wood and standing dead trees along these vegetation zones was evaluated. Most of the CWD stock in the Sonneratia–Avicennia and Avicennia zones was found in downed wood, while it mainly accumulated in standing dead trees in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones. The total mass of CWD stock that accumulated in each zone ranged from 1.56–8.39 t ha−1, depending on the forest structure and inundation regimes. The annual woody debris flux in each zone was calculated by summing the necromass (excluding foliage) of dead trees and coarse litter from 2010 to 2013. The average woody debris flux was 5.4 t ha−1 year−1, and its zonal variation principally depended on the necromass production that resulted from forest succession, high tree-density, and lightning. Over all the zones, the above- and below-ground net primary production (ANPP and BNPP, respectively) was estimated at 18.0 and 3.6 t ha−1 year−1, respectively. The magnitude of BNPP and its contribution to the NPP was markedly increased when fine root production was taken into consideration. The contribution of the woody debris flux without root necromass to the ANPP ranged from 12 to 28%. © 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan."
2-s2.0-84993995288,"Tiamulin (TIA) is a widely used antibiotic in Thai swine farms and persists in swine manure storage. Significant amounts remain in swine manure after composting, posing risks related to the spread of the compound and the evolution of resistant genes when this compost is used as a fertilizer. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance TIA degradation. This study successfully purified TIA-degrading fungi, which have a high capacity for treating antibiotic-contaminated manure. Twelve strains were collected from swine farms and preliminarily examined for their ability to degrade recalcitrant compounds using brilliant green and crystal violet dyes at 0.05% (w/v). Three isolated fungi and three white-rot fungal strains–namely, Lasiodiplodia sp. F1, Fusarium sp. F5, Galactomyces sp. F8, Verticillium sp., Trametes versicolor, and Trametes hirsuta AK4–capable of developing considerable decolorized zones on both dyes exhibited their abilities to degrade 10 mg l−1 of TIA over a period of 12 days: 93.2 ± 0.0%, 82.4 ± 10.2%, 73.8 ± 5.6%, 89.3 ± 0.0%, 86.1 ± 0.0%, and 66.8 ± 4.8%, respectively. Lasiodiplodia sp. F1, Verticillium sp., and Trametes versicolor were able to remove TIA most efficiently (>85%) and have the potential to be applied to swine waste for the elimination of antibiotic substances.

2-s2.0-84993982880,"This study was aimed at comparing clinical applicability of serum HBsAg quantification in relation to intrahepatic covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA) in patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) monotherapy for 48 weeks. Overall, 32 and 36 patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB, respectively were recruited. Paired liver biopsies at baseline and end of therapy were analyzed for cccDNA. Virological response (VR) at 48 weeks post-treatment was defined as HBeAg clearance (for HBeAg-positive CHB) and HBV DNA <2,000 IU/ml (for both groups). The results demonstrated that baseline levels of all viral markers were higher in the HBeAg-positive group than the HBeAg-negative group. Baseline HBsAg correlated with cccDNA in the HBeAg-positive group (r = 0.452, P = 0.009) but not in the HBeAg-negative group (r = 0.018, P = 0.919). However, the magnitude of cccDNA and HBsAg decline at end of treatment was not different between groups. The reduction of HBsAg showed a positive correlation with cccDNA decline in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB (r = 0.544, P = 0.001 and r = 0.364, P = 0.029, respectively). Overall, responders had more decline in cccDNA and HBsAg levels compared with non-responders. Patients with serum HBsAg decline of >1.0 log10IU/ml during treatment archived VR and HBsAg clearance of 80% and 30%, respectively. In conclusion, serum HBsAg represented a better surrogate marker of intrahepatic cccDNA in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB compared to those with HBeAg-negative CHB. On-treatment, HBsAg reduction of 1.0 log10IU/mL was associated with a high probability of subsequent VR and HBsAg clearance in patients receiving PEG-IFN therapy. J. Med.

By complete immobilization of Rhizopus oryzae on a fibrous matrix, cell-free fermentation broth resulted in improved mass transfer and easy operation compared with free cell fermentation in a typical stirred fermentor. Environmental conditions generated in this fermentor configuration favoring the immobilized R. oryzae to grow and produce lactic acid without substrate repression at high initial glucose concentration during batch cultivation. Approximately 67% of the theoretical lactate yield (0.50 g/g) with the productivity of 1.05 g/L h and the final titer of 75.28 g/L was obtained from fermentation with high glucose concentration (150 g/L). Complete cell immobilization supported the continuous operation of lactic acid production by R. oryzae since cell wash out was diminished. When operating the continuous culture at an appropriate dilution rate, a sufficiently high concentration of lactic acid (72.32 g/L) with a small amount of remaining glucose (<5 g/L) was obtained.

We analyzed the data of 2034 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients enrolled into the multi-center registry under Thai Lymphoma Study Group from setting. The incidence, September 2006 to December 2013 to represent outcome from a resource limited pattern, management, and outcome of SCNS relapse were described. The 2-year cumulative incidence (CI) of SCNS relapse was 2.7 %. A total of 729, 1024, and 281 patients were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk CNS international prognostic index (CNS-IPI) with corresponding 2-year CI of SCNS relapse of 1.5, 3.1, and 4.6 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis demonstrated advance stage disease, poor performance status, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, presence of B symptoms, more than one extranodal organ involvement, high IPI, and high CNS-IPI group as predictive factors for SCNS relapse. Rituximab exposure and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis offered no protective effect against SCNS relapse. At the time of analysis, six patients were alive. Median OS in SCNS relapsed patients was significantly shorter than relapsed patients without CNS involvement (13.2 vs 22.6 months) (p < 0.001). Primary causes of death were progressive disease (n = 35, 63.6 %) and infection (n = 9, 16.7 %). In conclusion, although the incidence of SCNS relapse in our cohort was low, the prognosis was dismal. Prophylaxis for SCNS involvement was underused even in high-risk patients. Novel approaches for SCNS relapse prophylaxis and managements are warranted. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-84995528486,"The addition of acrylate polymers with low molecular weight, such as poly(isobutyl methacrylate) (PIBM) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), effectively enhances the force required to stretch a molten polypropylene (PP) at the nonisothermal condition without the enhancement of shear viscosity in the molten state. The mechanism of this phenomenon is found to be attributed to prompt solidification of PIBM and PMMA droplets, which deform greatly to the flow direction in the die land and near the die exit during the extrusion and stretching processes. After the die exit, the deformed droplets show the glassification prior to the crystallization of PP matrix because of the rapid cooling at stretching. Consequently, they behave like rigid fibers in a molten PP, which provide the excess stress by large shear deformation of the matrix between the dispersed glassy fibers during stretching. © 2016 The Society of Rheology."
2-s2.0-84991396698,"Immune dysregulation observed in schizophrenia alters tryptophan metabolism. Tryptophan metabolism is triggered by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Tryptophan is converted to quinolinic acid, a potent neurotoxin, and to kynurenic acid, an NMDA antagonist. 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan (MDT) inhibits IDO. Melatonin is metabolized by IDO while inhibiting TDO. We evaluated the reversal of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like behavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice by the administration of MDT (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p.) or melatonin (15 mg/kg, per os). Oxidative stress and inflammatory alterations, i.e. myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-6 were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum. Risperidone was used as standard antipsychotic. Ketamine triggered positive- (PPI deficits and hyperlocomotion), cognitive- (working memory deficits) and negative (social interaction deficits) schizophrenia-like symptoms. These symptoms were accompanied by increased MPO activity, decreased GSH and increased LPO in all brain areas and increments in hippocampal IL-4 and IL-6. MDT and melatonin reversed all ketamine-induced behavioral alterations. Risperidone did not reverse working memory deficits. MDT and melatonin reversed alterations in MPO activity and GSH levels. LP was reversed only by melatonin and risperidone. Risperidone could not reverse MPO alterations in the PFC and striatum. All drugs reversed the alterations in IL-4 and IL-6. The hippocampus and striatum of ketamine+melatonin-treated animals had lower levels of IL-6. Our findings provide further preclinical evidence that immune-inflammatory and oxidative pathways are involved in schizophrenia and that targeting these pathways is a valid treatment option in schizophrenia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-84991517831,"Objectives: To compare the effects of a 12-week treatment with Pueraria mirifica (PM) gel or a conjugated estrogen cream on vaginal maturation index, vaginal symptom score, vaginal health assessment score, and vaginal flora in postmenopausal women. Methods: In a prospective, noninferiority, randomized controlled study, 82 postmenopausal women with at least one vulvovaginal symptom, that is, dryness, soreness, irritation, dyspareunia, or discharge, were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups for treatment with either PM gel or conjugated estrogen cream (CEE). The treatment regimen consisted of application of 0.5 g of product intravaginally daily for 2 weeks, and then decreased to three times per week for 10 weeks. Vaginal maturation index, vaginal symptoms score, and vaginal health assessment score were evaluated before the beginning of the study and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment with PM or CEE. Results: The vaginal maturation index increased significantly in both treatment groups at week 12, from 22.44±22.28 to 47.56±29.00 and from 27.07±26.12 to 66.90±22.42 in the PM and the CEE groups, respectively (P<0.05). A significantly higher effect was, however, observed in the CEE group (P<0.05). Vaginal symptom scores decreased significantly after treatment in both groups, from 4.37±2.79 to 0.95±1.88 and from 4.15±2.16 to 0.68±1.64 in the PM and the CEE groups, respectively (P<0.05), with no statistically significant different between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: The use of a 12-week treatment regimen with Pueraria mirifica gel was shown to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy. Conjugated estrogen cream was found to be more effective compared to Pueraria mirifica gel in improving signs of vaginal atrophy and restoring vaginal epithelium at 6 and 12 weeks. © 2016 by The North American Menopause Society."

2-s2.0-84989211433,"The antibody response and pattern of shedding of vaccine virus following vaccination with modified live genotype I or II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccines (MLVs) were investigated. Ninety PRRSV-free pigs were divided randomly seven, groups including the NEG, EU1, EU2, US1, US2, US3 and US4 groups. The NEG group was unvaccinated. The EU1, EU2, US1, US2, US3 and US4 groups were vaccinated with the following MLVs: AMERVAC® PRRS, Porcillis® PRRS, Fostera™ PRRS, Ingelvac® PRRS MLV, Ingelvac® PRRS ATP, and PrimePac™ PRRS+ , respectively. Sera were quantitatively assayed for viral RNA using qPCR. Antibody responses were measured using Idexx ELISA and serum neutralization (SN). Shedding of vaccine virus was investigated using sentinel pigs and by detection of viral RNA in tonsil scrapings. Antibody responses were detected by ELISA at 7-14 days post-vaccination (DPV) and persisted at high titers until 84 DPV in all MLV groups. The SN titers were delayed and isolate-specific. SN titers were higher for the homologous virus than for heterologous viruses. Age-matched sentinel pigs introduced into the EU2, US2 and US3 groups at 60 DPV seroconverted. In contrast, sentinel pigs introduced at 84 DPV remained negative in all of the MLV groups. Vaccine viral RNA was detected in tonsil scrapings from the EU2, US2 and US3 groups at 84-90 DPV. No viral RNA was detected beyond 70 DPV in the EU1, US1 and US4 groups. In conclusion, all MLV genotypes induced rapid antibody responses, which were measured using ELISA. The development of SN antibodies was delayed and isolate-specific. However, the shedding pattern was variable and depended on the by virus isolate used to manufacture the vaccine. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien."

The minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation technique is useful in several additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) reduction methods. Original form of MMSE estimator is the integral form. Unfortunately, integral form of MMSE estimator cannot be obtained in simple form for any interesting peaked, heavy-tailed densities (also known as super-Gaussian densities). In this work, we proposed a differential form of bivariate MMSE estimator. The development depends on bivariate Taylor series. The proposed estimator requires no integration.

2-s2.0-84979256587,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and provides activated one-carbon units required for synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins and numerous biological compounds. SHMT is involved in photorespiratory pathway of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Accumulating evidence revealed that SHMT plays vital role for abiotic stresses such as low CO2 and high salinity in plants, but its role in cyanobacteria remains to be clarified. In this study, we examined to overexpress the SHMT from halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica in freshwater cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. The transformed cells did not show an obvious phenotype under non-stress condition, but exhibited more tolerance to salinity than the control cells harboring vector only under high salinity. Elevated levels of enzymes in phosphorylated serine biosynthetic pathway and photorespiration pathway were observed in the transformed cells. Glycine level was also increased in the transformed cells. Physiological roles of SHMT for salt tolerance were discussed. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The study of DCP and Bis-EMA contents on the melt rheology, thermal properties, dynamic mechanical properties and morphology of the reactive extruded pellets is presented. The results show that PLA with a DCP content higher than 3 phr exhibits increases in both the melt modulus and complex viscosity as compared with PLA. The introduction of DCP into PLA improved the thermal stability of the PLA. PLAs with various Bis-EMA contents showed the optimum storage modulus and complex viscosity to occur at 5 phr Bis-EMAs. Moreover, the glass transition, cold crystallization and melting temperature of PLAs decreased with increasing Bis-EMA content. The crystallinity of the partly crosslinked PLAs was lower than that of PLA. Similar to the rheological results, the thermo-mechanical properties showed that the storage modulus and loss modulus of the partly crosslinked PLAs increased with increasing Bis-EMA contents up to 5 phr. In addition, these partly crosslinked PLAs showed rough surface or sea island-like structure. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
2-s2.0-84971373699,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isolated lesions of the medulla oblongata are difficult to diagnose due to their rarity and high biopsy risk. Several individual case reports have been published, but a systematic descriptive study is lacking. Our study has three objectives that 1) provide a differential diagnosis, 2) describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and 3) propose a stepwise MRI-based approach to the isolated lesions of the medulla oblongata in nonstroke patients. METHODS: We performed an institutional Review Board–approved retrospective analysis of 34 consecutive cases of isolated medullary lesions from nonstroke causes identified from our imaging database between January 2000 and May 2015. Eleven were excluded due to lack of pretreatment or follow-up MRI. MR studies were reviewed by two blinded neuroradiologists. The diagnosis, demographic data, and MR findings were reported using frequencies and proportions. An MRI-based diagnostic algorithm was proposed. RESULTS: Most lesions were neoplasms (47%), followed by vascular malformations (15%), demyelinating/inflammatory lesions (15%), others (12%), unknown (8%), and infection (3%). Five MRI patterns were identified: 1) cystic lesion, 2) exophytic noncystic lesion, 3) intrinsic lesion with T2 hypointensity, 4) enhancing intrinsic lesion, and 5) nonenhancing intrinsic lesion. All showing patterns 1 and 2 were neoplasms or cysts. All showing pattern 3 were vascular malformations. Patterns 4 and 5 comprised of multiple etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Neoplasms are the most common cause of isolated medullary lesions in nonstroke patients. Other differential diagnoses include vascular malformations, demyelinating/inflammatory lesions, and infections. A stepwise MRI-based approach can help differentiate between various etiologies.

2-s2.0-84929649705,"Objectives: To assess the postoperative oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), pain and swelling after surgical implant placement and to investigate their association with socio-demographic and clinical variables. Materials and methods: A total of 85 partial edentulous patients requiring implant-supported fixed prostheses were enrolled. Standard surgical practice for implant placement was employed. Interviews were conducted to assess the OHRQoL based on the oral impact on daily performances (OIDP) index preoperatively as well as 2 weeks and 1 month postoperatively in addition to the degree of pain and swelling at 2 weeks postoperatively. The socio-demographic and clinical variables of interest were also assessed. Results: Patient's OHRQoL was reduced at 2 weeks followed by a return to baseline levels 1 month postoperatively. The median OIDP scores were 5.0, 12.0 and 3.5 preoperatively, 2 weeks and 1 month postoperatively, respectively. Eating and teeth cleaning were affected after surgery. Overall, 50.6% of the patients perceived no to mild pain, whereas 36.5%, 49.4% and 14.1% reported no, localized or extensive facial swelling, respectively. No association was found between pain and any variable, but anterior implantation and bone augmentation were more commonly associated with facial swelling. Oral health-related quality of life worsened in patients with more pain or facial swelling as well as in cases involving multiple implant placement or bone augmentation procedures. Conclusions: Oral health-related quality of life deteriorated shortly after surgery based on eating and teeth cleaning difficulties. A high degree of pain, extensive swelling, multiple implant placement and bone augmentation procedures were all associated with oral impacts. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2-s2.0-84964267738,"Objectives: To estimate the possible reduction of tube output as a function of head size in dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: A 16 cm PMMA phantom, containing a central and six peripheral columns filled with PMMA, was used to represent an average adult male head. The phantom was scanned using CBCT, with 0-6 peripheral columns having been removed in order to simulate varying head sizes. For five kV settings (70-90 kV), the mAs required to reach a predetermined image noise level was determined, and corresponding radiation doses were derived. Results were expressed as a function of head size, age, and gender, based on growth reference charts. Results: The use of 90 kV consistently resulted in the largest relative dose reduction. A potential mAs reduction ranging from 7 % to 50 % was seen for the different simulated head sizes, showing an exponential relation between head size and mAs. An optimized exposure protocol based on head circumference or age/gender is proposed. Conclusions: A considerable dose reduction, through reduction of the mAs rather than the kV, is possible for small-sized patients in CBCT, including children and females. Size-specific exposure protocols should be clinically implemented. Key Points: • Fixed exposure settings in CBCT results in overexposure for smaller patients • For children, considerable dose reduction is possible without compromising image quality • A reduction in mAs is more dose-efficient than a kV reduction • An optimized exposure protocol was proposed based on phantom measurements • This protocol should be validated in a clinical setting © 2016, European Society of Radiology."
2-s2.0-84922900576,"Long-term scenarios play an important role in research on global environmental change. The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd"
2-s2.0-84928152781,"Bio-sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants is typically disposed of in landfills. Among the pressure of environmental problems, alternative options for bio-sludge disposal have been proposed. In addition to landfills, burning sludge in cement kilns and composting are new options for managing bio-sludge in Thailand. The objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of alternative waste management practices for bio-sludge, including landfilling with landfill gas utilization systems, cement kilns, and composting, compared with conventional landfills. The environmental impact from each scenario was calculated at midpoints and damage levels using the IMPACT 2002+ method. The results indicate that landfilling with landfill gas utilization systems shows the greatest potential for greenhouse gas reduction compared with conventional landfills. The cement kiln option has the highest potential for aquatic acidification, terrestrial acidification and nitrification. While the fertilizer option has lowest potential for those impacts, the potential for aquatic eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity is highest in this option. Finally, the endpoint analysis showed that the fertilizer option has a high performance in regard to human health and climate change, and it was recommended for selection as a first priority for bio-sludge disposal in Thailand. © 2015, Springer Japan."
2-s2.0-84930797064,"Activated carbon (AC) was prepared from wastewater treatment sludge by KOH activation and then used for the adsorptive purification of crude glycerol (CG). The effect of different KOH: char (w/w) ratios (1–6), KOH soaking times (5–25 h), and activation temperatures (500–900 °C) on the surface properties of the obtained sludge-derived ACs and their adsorption capacity for impurities in H3PO4 pretreated CG was explored. The preparation conditions affected the textural properties and surface chemistry of the sludge-derived AC and its efficiency in the adsorptive purification of CG. Oxygen-containing surface functional groups, particularly carbonyl groups, as well as the textural properties, played a more important role in the adsorptive purification of CG. Among the sludge-derived ACs, the one impregnated at a KOH: char (w/w) ratio of 5.0 for 25 h and then activated at 800 °C exhibited the most suitable surface properties for the purification of pretreated CG, attaining a 93.0 % (w/w) glycerol level at an AC dose of 67 g/L for 2 h with agitation at 250 rpm.

2-s2.0-84905892595,"The aim of this research is to propose the practical model to predict the in-process surface roughness during the ball-end milling process by utilizing the dynamic cutting force ratio. The proposed model is developed based on the experimentally obtained results by employing the exponential function with five factors of the spindle speed, the feed rate, the tool diameter, the depth of cut, and the dynamic cutting force ratio. The experimentally obtained results showed that the frequency of the dynamic cutting force corresponds with the frequency of the surface roughness profile in the frequency domain. Hence, the dimensionless dynamic cutting force ratio is proposed regardless of the cutting conditions to predict the in-process surface roughness by taking the ratio of the area of the dynamic cutting force in X axis to that in Z axis. The multiple regression analysis is adopted to calculate the regression coefficients at 95 % confident level. The experimentally obtained model has been verified by using the new cutting conditions. It is understood that the developed surface roughness model can be used to predict the in-process surface roughness with the high accuracy of 92.82 % for the average surface roughness and 91.54 % for the surface roughness. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
